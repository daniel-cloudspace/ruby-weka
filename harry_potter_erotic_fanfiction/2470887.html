 okay just a note this story is so au it not even funny i know the characters may be a bit ooc but think of it as dramatic license for a fanfic i do hope you enjoy it anyway this story is going to have nothing from harry potter and the half blood prince the reasons should be obvious for those of you who have read it i also feel compelled to point out that i am not jkr nor is this story a product of anything but my desire to play in her universe for a while i promise to leave it as neat as i found it the characters belong to her many thanks to my beta reader vaughn who has so generously offered to help me correct my stupid mistakes thank you all for reading it was finished the final battle had been won and all the fear anguish and suffering was over voldemort was dead thanks to the efforts of a small underappreciated group of people known as the order of the phoenix and the boy destined to lead them harry potter hermione looked over at her exhausted companions smiling brilliantly despite herself they were alive voldemort was gone and the death eaters were being rounded up as they stood next to their leader smoking remains ron was limping slightly due to a slicing hex he received on his left thigh from avery harry looked shell shocked and a bit blasted from the backlash of the dark lord destruction but came through it all surprisingly unharmed she herself sported several minor lacerations bruises and what felt to be a broken rib from lucius malfoy kick to the chest the three gryffindors stumbled toward each other and met in a desperate hug each of them had feared for the others and all were relieved they survived hermione wept tears of joy at the fact that her best friends were alive and virtually unharmed harry had told them of the prophecy only days before the battle convinced he was not going to survive he d been afraid they would react badly if they knew earlier instead of dragging them down however the possibility that harry would die inspired them to work together better than they ever had the result was a combined spell hermione taught them an hour before voldemort arrived the three students backed by dumbledore army the order of the phoenix most of the sixth and seventh year students and the few aurors who disobeyed minister fudge fought their way through voldemort death eaters to the hill upon which he ensconced himself to view the battle he was flanked by lucius malfoy bellatrix lestrange and severus snape who were prepared to defend their master to the death well two of them were hermione ron ginny and neville deflected curses from the two fanatical death eaters while harry and voldemort took each other measure snape watched carefully waiting for the right time to reveal himself bellatrix fell first to neville longbottom who finally took revenge for what she did to his parents ginny and ron held lucius malfoy at bay hoping for an opening to take the evil wizard out they were surprised when a flash of green light struck him in the back and he crumpled to reveal an angry draco malfoy with a look on his face stating he hated his father more than them then there was no time to think as voldemort reinforcements arrived it was at this point that voldemort motioned to snape take them out severus instead of leaping to curse the students as expected snape pulled off his hated mask and tossed it aside with a lightning movement he was in formation with harry hermione and ron voldemort screamed with rage and focused his energies on severus just as he had expected the slytherin professor put all his energies toward deflecting his former master curses knowing it was only a matter of time before he slipped he hoped the three gryffindors cast their spell before then voldemort yelled and a purple ray of light shot toward snape he was unable to raise his wand to block in time and his life flashed before him as he realized his time had come he hoped his sacrifice would not be in vain a golden shield interposed itself draco and ginny stood on either side of him both having cast the shielding charm at the same time there was no time for thought or thanks as the fight continued but he began to think he might survive thanks to his godson and one of the least annoying weasleys harry ron and hermione pointed their wands at voldemort and began to chant the spell it had taken hermione two sleepless nights to find it not to mention multiple trips to the restricted section of the library under harry invisibility cloak she remembered reading something about a binding spell from the time of merlin it was designed to bind a wizard magic so it would be impossible for him to use it another day had been spent modifying the spell to bind his spirit as well in the end headmaster dumbledore had pronounced it good and gave hermione full marks for her mastery of charms exoro vergo noc nocens obtestor expedio a pugna expostulo victum suum animus quaeso refero hoc vita a brilliant flash of light followed by screams from all over the battlefield marked the passing of one of the world greatest dark wizards voldemort death eaters dropped where they stood dark marks burning with the death of their master hermione quickly found herself at professor snape side making sure he was okay and no one mistook him for one of the bad guys he lay unconscious on the battlefield but the scar that marred his arm for twenty years was gone only a light tracery of fleshy lines remained cleaning up the battlefield took time there were far too many casualties far too many youthful bodies being carried to the infirmary and the large room being used for a morgue only one professor died professor gyrfon this year defense against the dark arts teacher but several students were also killed in the fight susan bones cho chang justin finch fletchley terry boot and far too many others to think about one month before graduation and the empty seats would no doubt haunt the survivors they were alive however and very glad to be so harry potter had fulfilled his destiny and hopefully would be able to lead a fairly normal life from now on he had no illusions about his popularity now he would be the boy who killed voldemort but it was worth it to be able to sleep at night or walk outside without fear two weeks passed and the students had returned to a fairly normal schedule headmaster dumbledore called off dada classes stating that anyone who survived the war should know plenty enough for their newts potions had been cancelled for a few days while the headmaster worked to get severus snape released from azkaban he finally managed to threaten cajole and just plain intimidate the minister of magic cornelius fudge into giving the former death eater a full pardon colin creevy picture of snape fighting voldemort on the front page of the prophet probably helped the potions master returned surly as ever and the school prepared for finals and graduation there had been rumours for some time about the ministry working to enact a new law that would improve the wizarding world and help it recover from what was now officially recognized as a war the students of hogwarts remained blissfully unaware however as they attended the final classes of the year and took their end of year exams it was to no one surprise that hermione granger was awarded more newts than any other student in the past 500 years severus snape was slightly annoyed to have his record beat but as he never took arithmancy it was only to be expected he refused to admit he was impressed however one week before graduation harry hermione and ron were seated in the great hall celebrating the end of newts and enjoying the respite before they were sent out into the real world no one was surprised when headmaster dumbledore asked harry to return in the fall as the next defense against the dark arts professor he was thrilled at the chance he had truly enjoyed teaching the other students for dumbledore army and proved he had a knack for it with the wild success of the da members at the final battle ron on the other hand decided to get out of the fighting business entirely and scrap his plans for joining the ministry as an auror he was disillusioned by their behaviour and realized he would not last very long without losing his infamous temper he joined a professional quidditch team instead it was a dream come true he was the back up keeper for the chudley cannons and if things went well would probably be first string within the next two years hermione was due to apprentice with professor flitwick for the next two years while attending the merlin institute for higher learning she planned to major in charms and potions the bushy haired girl had expressed an interest in moving on someday to the study of alchemy which integrated both disciplines her graduate proposal was already outlined she planned to find a treatment for victims of the cruciatus curse she had a theory that involved the usage of both a charm and a potion hogwarts would continue to be her home for the next two years and then it was up to flitwick to determine if she took over for him when he retired professor snape was annoyed that the gryffindor know it all was staying but as she was without her two lackeys he thought it might be tolerable he had surprised himself by deciding to stay at hogwarts and continue teaching potions headmaster dumbledore decision to finance his private research might have helped persuade him however for almost twenty years he dedicated all his free time to spying and doing things to appear to uphold voldemort cause now that the dark wizard was gone snape found himself with an inordinate amount of free time the only catch was that he agreed to help hermione with the potions part of her curriculum he would have been more annoyed if she were one of the dunderheads a slew of owls arrived that morning bringing with it a startling amount of mail a copy of the daily prophet landed near the potions professor plate along with an official looking scroll bearing the ministry seal this did not bode well minister fudge had wanted to throw him in azkaban for years and was angry with dumbledore for securing his release creevy untimely picture actually did more for his cause than the headmaster influence since it was nearing election time and fudge could ill afford to alienate the people feeling grateful for voldemort demise he had been pardoned fully for all past crimes but did not receive any other recognition beyond that having to sit through the ceremony awarding the order of merlin to everyone else at the battle left a sour taste in his mouth but a small voice told him he should be glad to be free so what could the ministry possibly want with him the great hall began to buzz with conversation as many of the students were agitated about something he noticed groups gathering around copies of the prophet and quickly skimmed the headlines to find out what was going on it was not hard to spot ministry passes marriage act in a surprising turn of events the wizengamot passed by a narrow margin the controversial marriage law requiring pure blood witches and wizards to marry muggle borns the law was created to solve a deficiency of viable wizard talented births in pure blood families for several years the ministry of magic has been involved in a study designed to verify the truth of several wizards claims that the wizarding world is on the brink of destruction according to barton himmilcook head researcher of st mungo magical heredity department inbreeding between pure bloods has diluted the blood of most wizarding families if we continue down this path we can expect the total extinction of wizardkind within the next 50 years according to his study the number of stillbirths and squib births has tripled during the past decade muggle born and half blood couples are far more likely to produce viable magical offspring recent studies have also indicated a trend toward half blood children possessing unusual magical gifts according to st mungo s the union between muggle born and pure blood witches and wizards will rejuvenate our society and prevent further hereditary misfortune says healer andrea norwick the downfall of lord voldemort one of the most powerful wizards of this age revealed the truth of his heritage that of a muggle and a witch harry potter himself has also been identified as a half blood wizard born of a wizard and muggle born witch how can we ignore such a powerful testament to healer himmilcook conclusions ministry officials claim the muggle born pure blood marriage act will revitalize the wizarding world by an infusion of magically talented children according to the law couples under the act will be required to produce no less than offspring within the period of the marriage all marriages will be arranged by the ministry based on a series of criteria determined by a team of specialists compatibility is a concern but the ministry asserts the couples chosen will have been carefully screened for personality and hereditary traits well suited to a lifetime commitment amelia harcourt celebrated war hero and senior member of the wizengamot had this to say while i find the idea of this law abhorrent one cannot dispute the evidence without immediate action the wizarding world as we know it will cease to exist i believe the witches and wizards affected by the act will come to understand its unfortunate necessity the law applies only to witches and wizards between 18 and 45 years of age who are unmarried and capable of having children scrolls bearing the identity of selected individuals are scheduled to go out monday morning severe penalties await those unwilling to abide by the wizengamot decision wizards and witches electing to disobey the law will have their wands broken as they are expelled from the wizarding world it is expected few will take this route thus far the reactions in the rest of the world have been mixed the united states and its allies have unilaterally condemned the ministry actions labeling it a barbaric violation of the most basic of human rights the american department of thaumaturgy has offered asylum to any wizard or witch refusing to obey the law several other countries have fallen behind the u s and the ministry is currently working to halt any transport between the two nations only time will tell if the ministry will accomplish its goal of preserving wizardkind by the institution of this terrible decree it is this reporter hope those affected by the law will at least find some solace in the knowledge that their actions could literally save the wizarding world snape was stunned he had heard rumours of course but had never thought the ministry would actually be able to get the bloody thing passed he was not amused if only they had waited six more years he would no longer be subject to it he sighed this cannot end well he thought an indignant shriek from the gryffindor table caught his attention he glanced over and was startled to see hermione granger staring at him in disbelief what the bloody hell his face paled she had a scroll in her hand like the one sitting next to him from the ministry oh fuck he quickly grabbed the scroll and ripped open the seal dear severus snape pleased to inform you under the tenets of the marriage act hermione jane granger to be your wife oh dear god he looked up their eyes met and he saw she was as pale as he felt a wave of weakness washed over him and he gripped the bridge of his nose in misery how could the ministry pair him with a girl no woman twenty years his junior she deserved better he thought she was brilliant talented powerful and had her whole life ahead of her why would they select a bitter angry former death eater as her husband our children would be amazing whispered a traitorous voice of all the women he d met over the years she was the only one whose intellect and drive to learn matched his had she been even ten years older he would be sending a thank you note to the ministry for their generosity but this she was far too young and innocent snape ah it appeared young ron weasley had discovered his friend fate it was ironic he shared the boy astonishment this promised to be interesting there was a wave of disturbance at the gryffindor table and suddenly they were all glaring at him he snorted as if he had a choice bloody hell severus yes headmaster i trust there is something we need to discuss he sighed yes headmaster dumbledore eyes twinkled rather inappropriately he thought perhaps you and miss granger might come to my office after dinner severus minerva head whipped around no it appeared she suddenly understood her house dissatisfaction perhaps minerva might bring the gi young woman headmaster she is her head of house after all dumbledore nodded i will see the three of you then taking one final glance at the young woman who was now his fianc e snape stood up and swept out of the hall he needed a short time to compose himself it was not often one life changed in such a sudden manner severus snape was not alone in his thoughts when the prophet arrived hermione thought it would be another issue praising harry for defeating voldemort and saving the wizarding world from darkness never in a thousand years would she have expected to read about this so called marriage law the idiots at the ministry decided to inflict on them did they learn nothing from voldemort and his bloody death eaters this was just another way to limit the rights of muggle born witches and wizards bastards oy hermione what with the scroll ron picked up the message bearing the seal of the ministry she grabbed it none of your business ronald she had a good idea what it was opening it here was not an option he grabbed it back is it another love letter from vicky let take a look shall we no ron it was too late he broke the seal on the scroll and unrolled it to see what it said his face turned white and he dropped it it was quickly back in her possession what did it say ron harry looked at his stunned friend curiously he would not have been the one to grab and open the scroll but now that the deed was done it from the ministry isntit ginny was always a smart one she nodded who are you going to marry i not sure ginny harry looked shocked wha what do you mean going to marry hermione thrust the article at him it all in there she snarled the final insult to muggle born everywhere while harry perused the article hermione gently unrolled the scroll that held her fate she didntwant to leave the wizarding world but what if her betrothed was a death eater or worse her eyes skimmed the page until reaching the most important part we are pleased to inform you that under the tenets of the muggle born pure blood marriage act you have been selected to be the wife of one severus salazar snape professor of potions hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry nuptials are to take place within one week of the receipt of this missive rejection of the offer must be received in the office of muggle born pure blood relations no later than twenty four hours from the receipt of the contract otherwise it will be assumed the offer is accepted rejection of the offer will result in a second selection by the ministry office which must be honored within the allotted week per the act you will be required to produce one offspring within the first five years of marriage and two before the end of the contract to assist you in this task you and your spouse will be bound by a fidelity charm that will prevent sexual activities outside the marriage bed if by the end of five years you have produced no children the marriage will be annulled and you will be required to take another pure blood spouse birth control charms and potions will not be allowed after your graduation from hogwarts hermione could not help the shriek that tore through her at the thought of marrying the potions master she was stunned not only had the ministry taken away her right to choose the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with they had selected the most reviled professor at hogwarts to fill the role her skin crawled at the idea of what she would be required to do within the week marry snape snape hermione glanced up to see ron gesture angrily at the letter why the bloody hell would they put you with him i a pure blood why dontyou marry me her gaze was drawn to the head table where she noticed professor snape looking in their direction i can t ron the law states i have to marry the person specified on this scroll or leave the wizarding world forever but snape she frowned i not exactly happy about it ronald you think i want to marry professor snape gasps could be heard from the other gryffindors oh bloody hell after a brief flurry of conversation the rest of the table knew hermione fate and as one they turned to glare at the potions master she almost chuckled at the look on his face he seemed as indignant as she hermione turned her attention back to her companions as he stood up to leave dinner was over far too quickly and hermione was unsurprised to see professor mcgonagall headed her way she had a feeling it was time to face the music miss granger if you would please come with me the headmaster would like to speak with you uh i ll see you guys later she turned to follow her head of house to see dumbledore severus snape was already in the office with the headmaster when they arrived his face looked pained momentarily when she entered great she thought my future husband despises me this is going to be a bloody nightmare albus dumbledore watched the two young people with amusement he figured severus had more of a problem with this marriage than hermione did she was very adaptive and was probably used to the prejudice against muggle born while she was not happy with the situation he knew she would make the best of it he was sure she realized her soon to be former professor was a far better choice for her than many other wizards out there most pure blood wizards expected their wives to stay home a fate that would never appeal to hermione severus would never ask such a thing of the woman sharing his life he needed someone like her they were both brilliant and driven with a wide variety of interests if only he could convince the two of them to give the marriage a fair chance one look at the two young people and he knew it would not be easy ironically enough in the end professor snape was a lot easier to convince than anyone could have anticipated the potions master was well aware of the dictates of the marriage law and knew the ministry would not be willing to make an exception for a former death eater marrying miss granger was a fate far better than having to marry some brainless twit and as he was unwilling to snap his wand in a grand gesture of defiance or abandon his family holdings by moving to america it was either marry his soon to be former student or a completely random stranger hermione actually was the difficult one after several hours of arguing speculation and downright refusal the head girl was still unwilling to bind herself to severus snape for the rest of her life it was the first time he regretted treating his students so badly he knew she would not have hesitated for an instant had it been lupin on the chopping block but apparently even the thought of being forced to marry a complete stranger was better than her old potions professor he gripped his nose in annoyance snape decided to interrupt the current tirade miss granger surely you understand that this is the best option for both of us i not sure you understand the seriousness of your situation he gazed at her sternly trying to show her the truth in his eyes most pure blood men expect their wives to stay at home and do nothing but plan parties and keep themselves beautiful and worthy of their arm ornament status narcissa malfoy graduated near the top of her class at hogwarts less than a year later she was ensconced in malfoy manor her greatest goal to become pregnant with the malfoy heir you are correct very few of the people on this list were active death eaters but many were sympathizers to the cause and would probably love to take their revenge on potter by doing something nefarious to his best friend the best you can expect is to be a virtual slave for the rest of your life the worst i suggest you let your imagination roam free he got up and went over to kneel in front of the startled young woman i cantpromise you flowers romance or true love but i can protect you and make sure you have the freedom to follow your dreams i will not stop you from going to university nor will i prevent you from having a career afterward i daresay i have enough wealth to hire someone to care for the children we are required to have should you wish it and i will provide you with anything you ask hermione stared at him for a moment her eyes seeking the truth in his what she saw surprised her the last thing i want is to be married to some woman more than likely another former student who doesnthave the capacity to carry on an intelligent conversation i know i have belittled you and your friends for years but it was necessary to the role i ve played for the order i not saying i a nice man hermione but i not the monster i seem to be either he took her hand i will work tirelessly to get this law overturned so that you may be free to live your life however you wish but until that time i will make sure you are free to achieve your goals it would be an incalculable loss to the wizarding world for you to leave or be forced to become a housewife please i just need you to trust me she glanced at dumbledore who nodded encouragingly and then back at him she knew he would not hurt her he had spent seven years protecting her and her friends she just was not sure she could deal with spending what could possibly be her life with him despite what he thought the likelihood of the marriage law being overturned in a way that would free her to remarry was very slim the commitment she would be required to make could possibly last a lifetime she thought back to what she had seen of him during the past year for months they d worked together on creating a potion that would weaken voldemort tenuous grasp on the material world snape had a theory that if they reduced his powers enough he would be unable to exist outside his body and harry could destroy him at that point it was their only hope until hermione remembered reading a story about merlin the night harry told them about the prophecy unbeknownst to harry and ron snape had been largely responsible for helping her find the spell and modify it she knew they did not trust him and would probably have refused to use it if they knew he was involved pushing her doubts aside she took dumbledore at his word and trusted snape voldemort was destroyed the sheer number of hours she had spent in his presence had shown her the other sides of the complex man that was her potions professor he was brilliant which she knew but also incredibly knowledgeable in every topic under the sun they could talk for hours about something and not get bored he challenged her in ways no one else ever had and he was thrilled to have found someone to talk with that did not require constant lessoning it was a good experience for them both but was it enough upon which to base a marriage hermione had always planned on marrying once and then only for love she was a closet romantic with very old fashioned views about the sanctity of marriage she had even refused the obligatory pre battle propositions from over half the men in dumbledore army perhaps if harry had asked but she knew he respected her too much for a fling the two of them walked into battle without the experience but with an unspoken agreement that they would talk afterwards now this had to happen she was angry that she and harry would never get a chance to find out if they were suited to each other she had been attracted to him for some time but it seemed only recently that he returned the favor she got the impression it was a eureka moment that knocked him off his proverbial feet she would have given a lot to be there she sighed professor snape i i appreciate your offer and will think about it would you mind if i talked with headmaster dumbledore for a few minutes before i make a decision of course not miss granger this is not a choice i would expect you to make lightly with a courtly kiss to her hand he stood up and swept out of the room robes billowing to this day i wonder how he does that severus has many secrets miss granger the least of which being the movement of his robes the headmaster smiled benevolently at her lemon drop thank you sir hermione paused to gather her thoughts you ve known professor snape longer than anyone excepting lucius malfoy and remus lupin you know him i i just dontknow what to do headmaster its all so overwhelming and having to make this decision so quickly is not easy i understand miss hermione it is not a simple thing to choose your life path in such a short period of time i believe the ministry has erred severely in the method by which it has presented this law the method headmaster the entire concept is barbaric how can they take away our rights to choose with whom we spend the rest of our lives we either have to marry the first person selected or risk getting someone worse out of a random drawing how can that be anything but inhumane dumbledore sighed i believe it is those very things that will cause the ministry to change the law my dear but in all honesty i do not believe it will be overturned hermione stared at him stunned wha what do you mean she had thought the same thing but it was a shock to hear the headmaster agree the research is correct hermione our world is in grave danger due to the irrational prejudices perpetuated by pure blood families for nearly 1000 years there are more stillbirths now than viable young and many of them are squibs filch is actually from a fairly influential pure blood family who rejected him because he had no magic are you saying you support this this exercise in enslavement not at all my dear or at least not quite i believe there were better ways to encourage pure blood families to marry outside their limited gene pool but i do agree something needs to be done hermione looked at him horrified hermione do not think that because i think we need to do something about our situation means i support the marriage law in all honestly i think it will do more harm than good the ministry fails to understand that many muggle born will find returning to the muggle world far preferable to being forced to marry a stranger far too many good witches and wizards will be lost to us and the ministry will be the cause it an option headmaster but one i would prefer not to take i ll move to america first at least they have the intelligence to condemn this law and offer succor to anyone fleeing it child i would like to ask you to reconsider what please hear me out he studied her carefully and then continued what i ask hermione is not for me the wizarding world or anyone else it is quite simply for the benefit of a single man severus snape now do not interrupt i know he has treated you and your friends badly for many years but much of that was due to his position as a death eater the rest may be attributed to his unhappy youth and even worse adulthood all i have ever wanted for severus is for him to find penance for the mistakes of his youth and happiness for the rest of his life he is a hard man to understand bitter angry and constantly struggling with the darkness in his soul but more than that he is an honorable man with an incredible intellect curiosity and passion for knowledge that i have seen in only one other person in all my years at hogwarts he met her eyes you are that person the ministry created a method by which wizards and witches affected by the law might be paired with someone compatible both physically and mentally they are looking to encourage procreation not extermination i managed to glance at the results of your and severus examination and was rather startled to find the two of you eminently compatible you think i should go through with it i simply think you should consider your choices carefully and try not to let the past get in the way of the future he hates me no he doesn t my dear he actually always been rather proud of your accomplishments admittedly he wishes you d been sorted into slytherin but you have surprised him along with the rest of us with the things you ve done he will take care of you and make sure you have the chance to do whatever you want even moving to america will not guarantee that why are you so intent on this you more than anyone understand him hermione and more than that you appreciate him severus may not show how it affects him but he is far more comfortable around you than anyone else i ve seen him with he trusts you and that should count for a lot i ve always wanted to see him happy with someone who knows him for who he is and is able to see past the act to the man beneath you have that capability he trusts you enough to show you i think his true self it will not be easy but then you ve always thrived on challenges i give him a chance hermione i promise you that if things do not work out i will aid you in any way i can to make sure you are taken care of should you decide to leave hermione focused inward and thought if she were honest with herself she would have to admit severus snape met many of the requirements for her dream man as much as she found harry attractive there would always be something missing she was an intellectual and longed for someone to share that part of her life with it was simply not possible to get that from friends once she got into college she was sure she would meet some people with similar propensities for study but having a husband that she could chat with over breakfast about anything that was something to be dreamed of she also had to secretly admit she had always found the potions master a bit attractive he was not classically handsome like professor lockhart but he had striking features accented by the tall dark and brooding look found in modern fiction he was mysterious and his voice could send chills down her spine like no other she wondered what it would be like to have him whisper to her while they carried out their marital duties she shivered if he was at all like what he seemed to be not the evil bastard professor but the snarky and brilliant man she worked with earlier this year she knew she could be very happy with him indeed perhaps she should give him a chance i d like to speak with him sir before i make up my mind he beamed of course you would my dear i ll send him in i assume you wish this to be a private conversation please the headmaster left and moments later professor snape walked into the room robes still billowing she took the opportunity to study him carefully and silently admitted he was not too bad to look at nor did she think it would be a bad thing to wake up to in the morning she blushed at the thought you wished to speak with me miss granger hermione very well you wished to speak with me hermione hearing her name spoken with his silky voice was like a caress to her soul uh yes i was uh hoping we could talk about this entire marriage thing his eyebrow arched as he looked at her with amusement please enlighten me uh why did she always let him intimidate her she was a gryffindor damn it professor severus uh right severus so what do you want out of this he looked surprised in all honesty hermione i would prefer not to go through with this at all however seeing as that is not an option i would like to bind myself to someone i can stand for more than a few hours at a time someone who is capable of intelligent thought but will not be constantly leeching on me and disrupting my research it would be advantageous to find someone who could help me but the likelihood of that is very slim i am a man therefore i would like to be with someone at least moderately attractive and it would be ideal to find someone who thought me so i do not want someone who will not be a good mother to our children but i would prefer to not go over the required number and most important of all i would like to be with someone i can care for and who can care for me in return love would be nice but highly unrealistic one of the things hermione noticed about his answer was that it was largely self depreciating it was obvious to her that he did not think anyone could fit those criteria he could probably fall for someone like the ideal he described but he found it unlikely that same woman would fall for him in return instinctually hermione knew it would not take much for her to come to care for him perhaps to the point of love she looked him in the eyes final question do you think i could meet your expectations snape was silent for a moment as he considered while it was true that she had annoyed him for seven years as his student it was a pleasant sort of annoyance brought about by the frustration of dealing with a brilliant student surrounded by dunderheads she had matured over the past two years into a beautiful and poised young woman with the potential to accomplish anything she was like him brilliant curious and thirsty for knowledge without the temptation to fall into darkness for the answers his biggest problem was the idea of this angelic creature binding herself to him for what could be the rest of her life but would she be better off with someone else he wondered far too many pure bloods would be proud of her accomplishments at hogwarts but threatened by her intellect and knowledge they would stifle her expecting that she would settle down and be the proper wife the vision of narcissa on her wedding day flashed through his mind it should have been the happiest day of her life instead his cousin spent it weeping because she knew the wedding was a herald to the end of her dreams that decided him he returned her gaze yes i do she seemed surprised before she could respond he bowed gallantly and took her hand kneeling before her for the second time that day he murmured in a soft velvety voice i would be honored hermione jane granger to have you as my wife i promise i will care for you as you deserve but will not prevent you from achieving your dreams i hope we can build a satisfactory relationship for as long as necessary will you marry me she gave him a shy smile it would be my pleasure severus the wedding was a simple affair by pure blood standards her family and friends the staff and the ministry witness draco malfoy stood for severus while ginny weasley was hermione maid of honor it took place in the great hall which had been gleefully decorated by professor flitwick in honor of his favorite student it was over quickly followed by a small intimate dinner between the newly married couple and their guests the wedding night was spent in paris courtesy of albus dumbledore it was a night for both of them to remember thank you guys so much for reading and better yet leaving reviews sorry this took so long it was not easy figuring out exactly where to go from the last chapter romantic snape is fun but very hard to write severus snape never thought he would ever be thankful for his association with lucius malfoy the evil bastard though dead still haunted his thoughts and deeds with the way he d influenced his younger friend life fortunately despite all his darkness the man had given severus some advice that was going to prove useful to his wooing of hermione if there was one thing that lucius knew how to do it was how to woo women narcissa was only one in a long line of women that captured the attention of the silver haired romeo but was the one fortunate enough to be chosen as his bride not that it stopped lucius from his explorations with other women while severus had difficulty understanding it and he hated the times lucius was in his cups reminiscing about his encounter with this woman or that he was grateful the man had given him endless words of advice it was with that in mind that severus headed to hogsmeade in order to prepare for his second date with hermione the week passed quickly far too quickly truth be told but he had ample time to explore the site of his choosing select appropriate food and drink and purchase items fitting for his wife and the mother of his child his only regret was that it was too early to reveal to her that he knew about her pregnancy he was determined things go well this time the house elves were more than thrilled to help prepare food for him and miss hermione whom they all remembered from her school days and actions with s p e w even though very few of them wanted freedom they appreciated her caring and dobby especially wanted to help make the friend of harry potter happy it bothered him to do it but he felt he needed to steal a page from potter book and prepare a special arrangement of flowers especially for her using advice from potter and the examples he found in a book the subtle art of floral magic severus was able to create a beautiful array he knew his wife would love ironically enough it was neville longbottom famed arboretum that contained the majority of the flowers he needed ginny malfoy was kind enough to help him find an attractive garment for hermione to wear on their date and her husband helped severus attire himself appropriately the actual day they had scheduled together was saturday and it came far too quickly he was thrilled when she agreed to set aside the whole day to spend with him the strange feeling that filled him when he received her owl made him wonder if he was going insane giddiness was not something that severus snape had ever been interested in feeling he always felt even when growing up that romance was overrated and a complete waste of time he always thought hermione would feel the same way but after watching her actions over the past three years and how she responded to potter blandishments he realized she was just as female as malfoy wife perhaps it was something fundamental to their nature but women appeared to need visible displays of affection to be happy it surprised him to think that he wanted his wife to be happy but then he looked at her and all doubts faded away it appeared that even an old evil death eater like him could fall in love with lucius and draco malfoy as his examples how could he have doubted it with his decision to win back his wife and truly earn the love she had given him there came a desire to please her to see the joy in her eyes as he surprised her in some pleasant way or another it was probably the oddest thing he ever felt but he reminded himself that it was normal for a man in love how this came to be he would probably never know but after seeing what he missed he knew he could never be without it the distance in her eyes was painful to see and he wished more than anything to have the loving spark return it was time to turn his back on the darkness and embrace a new life with hermione saturday arrived and severus met hermione at her quarters again finding himself bowled over by her beauty she had a glow about her that one usually attributed to pregnancy but now was not the time to let her know he was aware of her condition let her tell him in her own time she was stunning of course the weasley girl had styled her hair in a disheveled pile of honey and chestnut ringlets which fell to her shoulders like a waterfall of shining bronze her sundress was a translucent shell the color of apricots and lemons over a creamy white knee length gown his breath caught as her chocolate eyes met his and he saw the flurry of hope love fear following the quiet voice he was learning to trust he allowed his eyes to display a flash of emotion he could tell it calmed her to see that he was just as hopeful and afraid as she was the tall slytherin held out his hand to her and gently kissed it tucking it under his arm he led her in silence to a section of the castle he knew she had never been there were parts of hogwarts inaccessible to students and this was one of them the emotion in her eyes changed to curiosity and puzzlement he could not help but smirk at the familiar sight if there was one thing his wife was it was curious they reached a pair of tall oak doors bound with silver bearing the engraved forms of trees flowers and vines he gently pulled her to a halt and then turned to face her if you would so consent i would like to blindfold you before we go in why he smirked it a surprise her eyebrow arched a surprise i suppose i can endure being blindfolded for that it a good surprise i hope he turned her around and blindfolded her my dear he said softly into her ear i guarantee you that all my surprises will be good ones his heart leaped at her shiver taking her hand severus gestured and the doors swung open to reveal an opulent garden on the edge of a large forest they could both feel the change in the air as they stepped inside and started down the cobblestone path through the trees the doors swung shut and suddenly there appeared to be no way out severus was not worried as he knew the secrets of this place hermione breathed deeply and smiled at the sweet scent of flowers and trees the air was warm and she could feel the sunlight on her face suddenly she was overwhelmed by the urge to tear off the blindfold to see where they were could severus be taking her on a picnic they arrived at their destination in short order hermione was commanded to stay where she was while severus prepared to remove her blindfold she heard the rustling of cloth the clink of fine china and silver and was surprised to hear soft music begin to play then her sight was restored and she found herself speechless they were in a small clearing in the middle of what appeared to be a lush forest stretching endlessly around them a heavy blanket covered the thick carpet of vibrant green grass and upon it was set a perfect arrangement of food drink and the most beautiful flowers she had ever seen the smile that lit her face tugged at severus heart and he was glad to realize he finally did something right hermione looked around in wonder it beautiful severus perfect even her eyes met his thank you he bowed i live but to please you my darling playing the part of the gentleman he led her over to the blanket and helped her get settled he noted with bemusement that she continued to look around her in awe as he seated himself i do believe your head will rotate right off your neck if you continue to look around like that hermione she stuck her tongue out at him i just admiring the view severus he arched an eyebrow keeping his gaze on her so am i my dear but you do not see my head revolving about like a school owl it took a moment but the meaning of his subtle comment penetrated her thick gryffindor skull and she blushed i i suppose i will try to keep my head confined to its natural alignment then please do i would hate to see you sprout feathers and gain the urge to deliver mail she laughed as i would hate to see you go hunting for an owl treat large enough to keep me satisfied severus smirked and reached for the bottle he left chilling while he went to fetch hermione before she could speak he had the bottle open and was pouring the sparkling amber liquid into her glass i hope you dontmind my dear but i have chosen a sparkling apple cider as our drink for today i find my stomach has been somewhat touchy as of late and i do believe it is too early to begin drinking it was hard to miss the grateful flash in her eyes uh no severus actually it a relief to me as well i ve never really been big on drinking and i not really in the mood for it today thank you he raised his glass to second chances to second chances and to you severus for asking for one then to you my dear for granting it the couple drank and then silently agreed to begin their meal neither severus nor hermione had ever been one for talking during a meal so they ate in silence but watched each other with unusual intensity hermione wondered what he was thinking and more importantly if this was truly severus snape or if he was still pretending he was a bit more snarky and sarcastic today which she appreciated but he was also behaving as a total gentleman she found herself hoping he was truly like this if he was then she knew she would fall in love with him all over again maybe she wouldnthave to leave after all despite the oddness of the situation severus actually found himself enjoying the afternoon he knew he was not acting the way she was used seeing him but he d come to the realization several days ago that he was being given not only a second chance with her but a second chance at life she told him a long time ago that he chose how he acted and lived truer words were never spoken he was relieved she did not seem to mind his sarcasm but he made sure he was acting like the pure blood gentleman he was raised to be and that he treated his wife with the respect he owed her after lunch severus and hermione stood up in silent accord and went for a walk around the area he showed her some of the more unusual plant life and explained their usages in potions as he went she was enthralled by him and he couldnthelp but preen at the total attention she paid him in truth he loved teaching her she was the best student he ever had not that he would ever admit it and was one of the brightest witches he had ever heard of minerva had plenty of reasons to be proud of her and now that he was pushing aside all the bitterness from his past he was finding it a lot easier to appreciate her incredible mind severus what is this one be careful with that there are certain varieties of that plant which are very poisonous she quickly stepped back hands held behind her is that one of them he could see the fear in her eyes and knew it was for the baby more than herself it warmed him that she already loved their child so much he quickly reassured her no you can tell by the purple veins in the leaves red veins or blue ones indicate the presence of the poison as long as one can get a good look at the plant it is not hard to tell the difference but i would suggest being quite careful in the night or around sunset blue and purple can look far too similar hermione studied the unusual plant it appeared to be a small ball of leaves hidden in the shadow of a large oak tree there were only two of the plants and she could see no budding of others dragon sprout that made sense it looked to her like a dark leafed version of her father favorite vegetable the sprout is most often used in blood replenishing potions at st mungo s the ones they use there are far more potent than the ones in madam pomfrey stores i should probably make a note to contact one of the healers so they can harvest the plants are there always so few of them honestly hermione i dontthink i ve ever seen more than one grow in one place this is quite unusual hermione eyes widened that it you could use some of the sprouts in the all heal potion what what do you mean severus looked at her intensely interested in what she had to say one of the biggest problems with a death wound is the loss of blood your potion does a number of things but it doesnttake into account the need for new blood that what the blood replenishing potion is for no you dontunderstand the main reason a series of potions fail is because of the timing your potion severus would do all of it at once there would be a greater chance of survival as a result he nodded seeing where she was going so what we need to do is alter the potion so it is capable of balancing out the deficiencies in a dying person blood if they need it perhaps something for shock and pain as well so it needs to be reactive it going to have to be alchemical severus no simple potion will do you have a very good point my love i will have to think on this and do some research we severus we are going to think and do research this time he allowed himself to give her a genuine smile i was hoping you would say that how could i resist the opportunity to help the most talented potions master since morgan le fey he stepped forward and grabbed her hand jerking her into his arms you can t that why i was going to offer her wide eyes met his and he could see the excitement and wonder there it warmed him to think that he was able to make her feel something other than fear or anger take that black pulling her closer he tucked her head under his breathing in the strawberry scent of her chestnut curls and succumbed to a desire long suppressed a wave of his hand started the soft strains of music and he surprised her by bringing his arms around her for a slow dance she relaxed into him sighing with contentment both of them lost themselves in each other time passing without notice he marveled at how she made him feel with her mere presence it was peace unlike anything ever experienced and he resolved to do anything in his power to keep her with him hermione was simply enjoying the sensations of being in his arms she had fantasized about this side of severus for years but gave up hope it would ever happen especially after their encounter in his their chambers about children she wondered if now would be a good time to tell him unfortunately the memory of his hands holding hers as he pinned her to the wall surged forward and she had to repress a shiver stop it she thought maybe this is the real him but the doubts remained and she realized she needed to find out if it was before she told him about their child she knew severus well enough to know that he would do anything to keep her if he found out including pretend to love her she wanted truth i do hope you understand of course that this is unusual for me it does not by any means indicate that i dance she pulled back enough to smirk at him of course not and i must say you do not dance very well he smirked at her i am extraordinarily talented at many things i do not do my darling and so modest too she teased he gently touched her lips with his modesty my dear is a trait shared by hufflepuffs and gryffindors we slytherins do not ascribe to such banality there is no harm in having confidence in one abilities as you should well know my lovely know it all her arms snaked up to encircle his neck no slytherins are not modest but arrogance should never be mistaken for confidence and that is far more a trait of your house than any other is it arrogance or confidence to know you are well versed in something perhaps so much so as to be eagerly raising one hand in say potions class she flushed that was i was he stopped her with a kiss hoping against hope that he was not being too forward a moment later she took his breath away with her enthusiastic response is this what i ve been missing all these years bugger severus allowed himself to get lost in her holding her tightly as he tried to convey his love and apologies without words he felt a hand snake up his neck to tangle in his hair pulling his face closer and deepening the kiss again they lost track of time as each focused entirely on the other it was the most incredible kiss either of them had ever experienced hermione felt weak in the knees from the passion she felt from him and silently praised whatever powers at be that he decided to try to win her back images flashed behind her eyes of their difficult past but also of the good times they d shared his kiss reminded her that they still had a chance to make a better future together and she began to see the possibilities stretch before her it was a reluctant severus that broke the kiss but he made sure to keep a tight hold on her leaning over to place his lips near her ear he spoke in a deep velvety voice beauty and love are all my dream they change not with the changing day love stays forever like a stream that flows but never flows away and beauty is the bright sun bow that blossoms on the spray that showers where the loud water falls below making a wind among the flowers his lips gently brushed the flesh of her neck causing a shiver before he stood upright to gaze into her eyes a smirk came to his lips as he saw the affects of his words on her his wife was breathless staring at him in wonder and disbelief her eyes shone with emotion and he could tell she was shocked and thrilled at his actions she trembled in his arms as he lowered his face again to claim her lips in another passionate kiss this time he buried his hands in her hair marveling at its soft texture the scent of her was doing odd things to him and he found it difficult to think about anything beyond his wife lips and why would you want to do that you idiot wondered black voice agreeing for once with the bloody canine severus sternly told the voice to shut up and turned his full attention toward the act of thoroughly snogging the beautiful woman in his arms hermione was in heaven this was what she had wanted for years what she had waited for by the gods did she hope it lasted it was hard to think with his lips on hers and his hands lodged in her hair recognizing the futility not to mention foolishness of trying to focus on anything but him she let go and fully gave herself up to the task of kissing her husband it was some time before the two parted the rest of the afternoon was spent quietly exploring the forest and chatting stopping every once in a while to steal a kiss or fervently embrace both of them were surprised at the undercurrent of emotion between them but neither was willing to do anything but enjoy the experience they used the time to reacquaint themselves and to discover new things about the other it was the first time severus truly allowed himself to open up to her and he found it a liberating experience there was something about having a person to confide in someone who loved him that was cathartic he vowed never to shut her out again hermione for her part was thrilled that severus was sharing so much with her and on several occasions came within moments of telling him about their child only to pull back at the last minute to discuss something else she was not completely sure what was holding her back but until she was comfortable with the new severus snape she would say nothing she needed to know it was truly him and not some facade he put on to keep her with him she had enough of being manipulated into staying in a farcical marriage with a man who made no secret of the fact that he despised her or did he it suddenly occurred to hermione that severus snape might not have been able to bring himself to show his emotions to her before now maybe he sensed her pregnancy on some level or maybe he truly just realized how much he cared for her whatever the case she owed it to her child to give him a fair chance that meant letting go of her doubts and opening her heart to him once again hopefully this time he would know what to do with it you re beautiful hermione i hope you know that his sudden observation startled her uh well not really severus gently pulled her to him and took her face in his hands never doubt it my darling you are truly beautiful and i have been a fool for far too long but my hair my face you are physically attractive as well hermione but i speak of your spirit your mind i know i haventexactly been forthcoming with my praise but you know that i have never given it to many he smirked you are by far one of the most infuriating women i have ever met but by far the most brilliant talented and knowledgeable his gaze turned stern and i will deny to my dying breath ever saying such a thing to you so i suggest you keep it to yourself she chuckled heaven forbid i tell anyone you paid me a compliment severus insufferable gryffindor snarky slytherin know it all git he touched her face beloved severus she whispered their kiss this time was quick and fiery leaving them both flustered and breathless severus covered his discomfiture with a sarcastic comment about his wife ability to maintain her balance and then gallantly offered his hand for the rest of their sojourn in the forest the hours passed quickly and before they knew it the sun was headed toward the horizon lighting the sky with the pink and violet hues of dusk severus deliberately made sure they were near a small outcropping of large stones perfectly placed for watching the sun set over the emerald forest taking her hand he helped his wife up onto the rock formation and quickly joined her making sure she was seated comfortably in front of him with his arms wrapped around her they watched the sunset in silence i have something for you my darling severus soft voice startled hermione out of her relaxed trance it was a good interruption however as the dark tones washed over her body like warm water you didntneed to get me anything severus today this experience has been more than enough she turned slightly to look at him i could not think of a better gift he smirked and then touched his lips to hers that is good seeing as i wonthave to worry if you like it then he handed her a small box wrapped in green and gold paper hermione carefully unwrapped the gift taking a sadistic pleasure out of severus obvious impatience every year she wound up having half her presents unwrapped for her thanks to the impatience of harry ginny and draco by the time she was done her husband looked as if he was ready to rip the box out of her hand and tear the paper off himself his restraint was the stuff of legend the paper fell away to reveal a small green velvet box about the size of her hand gazing at her husband in wonder she hesitantly opened the box to reveal a pair of beautiful amber earrings perfectly matched to the necklace he got for her in alexandria tears at his thoughtfulness filled her eyes and she threw herself at him the startled slytherin barely had time to take her into in his arms before she was kissing him passionately she broke away momentarily to exclaim thank you severus before kissing him again severus bemusedly observed that this was only the first part of his gift to her gently disentangling himself he picked up the small card she missed in her haste to thank him for the gift she looked at him curiously and then took the card from him severus braced himself for her reaction positive or negative it was bound to be excessive my dearest hermione the years we have spent together have truly been among the happiest of my life our trip to alexandria was the second best memory i have topped only by our wedding and the night that followed these earrings recalled my memories of that experience and i hope they will be a pleasant reminder for you as well despite my behaviour and your insufferable gryffindor tendencies i have loved you for some time but was unaware of it perhaps should have myself checked for the same ailment that seems to affect my students please forgive my inability to see what was in front of me all this time you have given me a great deal over the years most notably your heart know that mine is yours for the keeping and that i promise to be worthy of your love from this moment on this gift is only the first of many that i plan on bestowing upon you as part of our courtship it is my intention hermione to court you as i should have years ago and hopefully win your heart all over again i love you my darling wife and look forward to the day in which we may be together again with heartfelt love severus severus unconsciously held his breath as he watched the emotions flicker in his wife eyes too quickly for him to follow it had taken him hours to craft the letter consulting with nearly a dozen books all giving him the same advice writing what he truly felt was one of the most difficult things he had ever done but one thought back to the day he died spurred him forward like nothing else he could almost hear black snickering at the sight of the evil potions master agonizing over a small bit of parchment oh dear she was reading it again did he do something wrong was he supposed to add more compliments more flowery turns of phrase perhaps he should have quoted shakespeare how did one learn this stuff potter would probably have scribbled something off in less than five minutes without a single glance at a book not that the boy would ever open a book that held something other than hexes curses or defensive spells annoying little bugger he d be damned if he was going to ask potter for advice on how to write a bloody love letter however it was very easy at times like this to truly hate the boy for simply being who he was his bloody father had always possessed the same gift for romance hermione was gazing at him now speechless for once he could not help the smirk that came to his lips at the thought of his constantly questioning know it all wife rendered silent by his words perhaps there was something to this romance thing and then all thought ceased as his wife latched onto him and gave him the kiss of his life considering their activity earlier today that was saying a great deal she pulled away an unknown amount of time later to gaze adoringly at him severus she said softly thank you your words mean more to me than a thousand gifts of jewelry not that i dontlove the earrings but thank you for this i will treasure it always i it is only what you deserve hermione you are you deserve to be treated like a queen hopefully i have at least made some progress in making the last three years up to you she placed her hand over his lips shhhh no more severus that time has passed i you said you wanted a second chance and i very glad i said yes but i dontexpect you to apologize forever just treat me well and we can move forward from there i promise you i will always treat you as you deserve my love i i cannot guarantee that i will always be pleasant i am not a nice man but for you i will try anything she shook her head dontchange for me severus i love you for who you are not what i you think i want you to be you are perfect the way you are the way you truly are severus not the mask you have so much difficulty taking off perhaps it was the darkness of the night and the peace of the forest but severus felt far more open to her than he ever imagined possible i ve worn it for twenty years hermione but i have come to realize i dontwant to be that man anymore you make me want to be better you are not as bad as you think severus you are a truly good man you re brave honorable devastatingly sexy and above all brilliant i love your mind your body and your soul i i cant say it wontbe difficult and i cantguarantee that when everything is done that everything will be perfect but i swear to you that i will try if you do every day my dearest i will strive to prove myself worthy of you every day for the rest of my life he could see her smile in the dim light and i promise to do the same severus and hermione stayed there for some time quietly discussing many of the things he had refused to even consider touching on before that fateful day a few weeks ago the stars sparkled overhead silent witnesses to the bonding of the couple somewhere far away an elderly wizard eyes twinkled with joy severus walked his wife back to her quarters and gave her a soft kiss goodnight before taking himself back to his rooms he tried very hard not to notice how empty they seemed without her but even he had difficulty with that level of self deception she was in his blood and he found it did not bother him at all later that night while severus lay abed unable to sleep he allowed his mind to wander and found himself thinking not surprisingly about hermione he had the feeling they made great strides today in the task of repairing their relationship it was not too difficult for him to slip back into that heady state of romantic bliss that had characterized their first few months together he was surprised to discover that he truly enjoyed romancing his wife and looked forward to many opportunities to do so in the future it was obvious that she enjoyed it and it was truly satisfying to see her so happy how were things going to change once she had the baby dumbledore was mentoring her in potions and it would not be long before she had her mastery it was too bad potter was teaching defense against the dark arts with her a potions mistress he might have actually been able to convince albus to finally let him take the dada position with potter there it was an impossible dream hermione would make a wonderful teacher just like she was going to make an extraordinary mother she never did anything by halves he knew and just as he knew himself he knew her she was probably reading up on motherhood right now he smirked eying the stack of books he had purchased earlier this week fatherhood was intimidating but the more he read about it the more he realized it was something he truly wanted like hermione he wanted her very badly he wanted to wake up next to her in the morning and fall asleep with her in his arms at night he wanted to work with her read with her match wits with her while basking in her brilliance a voice in his head told him he was being ridiculous but he chose to ignore it merely being in her presence did things to him that pushed the darkness back and made his life seem lighter and more bearable he never wanted to live without her again it was not going to be easy their first date was a prime example of the ways things could be difficult between them today on the other hand was an indication that they could also get along well without either of them being defensive or unhappy really the only thing that could have made this day better would have been her announcement that she was with child unfortunately it was probably too soon for her to feel comfortable telling him not that he blamed her he could never forget the fear in her eyes as he pinned her against the wall and threatened her and her child how could he do that to the woman he loved severus came to the realization that he was not going to be able to sleep any time soon his body yearned for hermione presence but he agreed with her that now was a good time for them to be apart it was killing him however several minutes later he was once again garbed in his dark robes stalking about the castle like the vampire many thought him the corner of his lips turned upward at the thought of the ease with which he could startle the students there were few incursions out into the hallways on the nights of his patrol which typically meant he had plenty of time to think without interruption severus my boy good evening speaking of interruptions he frowned and turned to face the headmaster albus a slight inclination of his head was all he granted the elderly wizard fancy meeting you here off for a walk are we as if you are not completely aware of why i am about the castle at this hour of the night albus you might as well drop the act seeing as i know just how omniscient you truly are the elderly wizard eyes sparkled madly with glee and he gestured for the dark man to join him then might i ask how your evening with mrs snape went severus snorted again albus we come to the subject of your omniscience but if you must have me tell you it went well good good i glad to see the two of you seem to be making great strides towards the reparation of your marriage has she mentioned anything of significance to you yet you know very well she has not do i albus severus my boy i appreciate your faith in my abilities but i dontknow everything another snort right and i believe i am getting ready to bear voldemort illegitimate love child congratulations are in order then it was truly amazing and infuriating how the man could turn any conversation into the most frustrating experience of his day but even severus was not immune to the headmaster sense of humor for the first time in years albus dumbledore was treated to the sight and sound of hogwarts potions master laughing uproariously once he regained his composure severus accepted the headmaster unspoken invitation and followed the elderly wizard to his office two lemon drops and a cup of tea later found the two men comfortably seated near the fire discussing inconsequentials suddenly he found himself pinned by his mentor stare how are things with you my boy i know this is a difficult time severus sighed and so they came to the purpose of the headmaster invitation yes albus it is but not so much for me as for hermione i suspect i have placed her in a difficult position it cannot be easy for her to contemplate such a large decision with such uncertainty and if she chooses to leave you his heart clenched at the thought then i can do nothing but let her go i would ask only that you aid me in making sure she and my daughter are taken care of daughter er did the old man know about his trip through her life just hoping albus chuckled softly yes severus i am aware you experienced an alteration in reality a short time ago but i am not aware of the specifics i severus thought for a moment and then decided that it might help to talk things out with someone seeing as his choices boiled down to minerva or albus now would be the time to confide in his friend he briefly told dumbledore how he got to be in the future and then described in detail the things he saw several times he was asked to go back and think harder on a situation which helped him notice things he had missed before he was surprised to find that confiding in his old mentor relieved some of his anxiety and actually strengthened his resolve to see things through until she came to a decision the two men spoke of her pregnancy and albus soothed his fears about her reasoning behind keeping it a secret it is only recently that she experienced a very traumatic argument with you over children severus it only makes sense that she would be a bit reticent to confide in you until she is comfortable with the person you have shown her you can be you must remember that the majority of the memories she has of you are not positive having been from her days at hogwarts and the three years you have been together but i wasntan ass the entire time albus she had to have found something in me redeemable if she fell in love with me indeed she has severus which is no doubt why you and i are having this conversation had she not loved you do you honestly think she would have stayed she severus glared at the headmaster you bribed her he accused i offered incentive severus she needed something to encourage her to stay the course a position on the wizengamot she has done an extraordinary job my boy you should be proud i he was not going to win this i am he muttered darkly good now what are your plans for your next date er i haventthought about it yet albus i i not sure how can i top this one albus looked his young friend in the eye earnestly hoping to impart some useful advice that the man would take to heart for once this is not a competition to see if you are able to top yourself with date upon date severus this is a fight for the heart of the woman you love the only way to win is to show her that her life with you will be worth striving for perhaps something simple this time severus thought it over and reluctantly had to agree with the headmaster hermione would no doubt enjoy another over the top date but the sheen of fancy dates would begin to pall soon and then what would he do he needed to figure out how to win her back another way it was going to be really difficult with her in a completely different part of the castle tell me severus what is it that you want to do with your life the unexpected question took him by surprise excuse me do you truly enjoy teaching er sometimes most of the time i feel as if i trying to pound sense into a stone why the bloody hell was albus asking him this severus my boy you have been at this institution for over twenty years in that time i have never seen you happy pleased or truly satisfied with your profession the war is over i will not continue to hold you here if this is not where you wish to be he looked at the headmaster shocked are you trying to tell me in your not so subtle gryffindor way that i am no longer welcome here at hogwarts no no not at all severus i am merely asking you to think about what you want out of life and know that i consider the slate between us clean you no longer need to feel you owe anyone penance for your actions in your youth at that severus interrupted my penance will never be complete albus he snarled the things i have done both then and during the war in the name of the light are too horrible to ever be forgiven do not patronize me with your tender sensibilities i know what the reality is albus i will never be accepted anywhere but here severus stood and headed toward the door severus stop the headmaster soft voice caused him to hesitate severus you believe no one will ever forgive you your mistakes in that you are wrong i not saying that everyone will but there are many that who remember what your true role in the war was voldemort could not have been defeated if it was not for your valuable intelligence to the order the older man sighed forgive yourself my friend only then will you find the happiness that you seek and the realization of your dreams refusing to acknowledge the old man severus stormed out of the room robes billowing but not before he heard the elderly wizard parting words only then will you find the way to release your anger and keep hermione with you shoving the sentiment from his mind the potions master headed back to his chambers as much as he hated it however dumbledore words echoed through his head right along with words from his wife long ago when will you forgive yourself severus asked hermione they were walking hand in hand around the snape manor gardens he stopped to pluck a blooming scarlet rose from a nearby bush the scent was intoxicating and reminded him of her and how he felt around her it was almost suffocating yet invigorating at the same time he chose to ignore her question for you my dear he murmured her smile warmed his heart like nothing else thank you severus she inhaled deeply and closed her eyes in enjoyment at the sweet scent i made a perfume using that particular type of rose once it lovely not taking his eyes from her he nodded indeed who did you make it for pain flashed in his eyes my mother oh i shhhh there is no need for an apology love she hesitated a moment and then squeezed his hand did she like it i never gave it to her he berated himself for mentioning it of course she would want to know everything she could about the situation he tried to harden his heart but this time was unable to muster the strength i it was made shortly after i graduated i joined the dark lord shortly afterward and was no longer able to gift it to her his eyes caught hers i am honestly not sure it would have suited her anyway it seems like her eyes urged him to continue stepping towards her his elegant hands cupped her face it seems it would be far more suited to you hermione she shivered at the rough affection in his voice that i would certainly wear it for you severus she whispered then i shall make some for you my darling his head lowered until their lips touched he pulled her to him and showed her his heart in the only way he knew how she responded to his kiss enthusiastically and the two became enraptured in each other that night severus and hermione spent the evening in each other arms severus recalled that the perfume had truly suited her but he never made another batch after the first she stopped wearing it after alexandria but he never noticed he was too caught up in his own anger to figure out what he d lost maybe it was time to make her some more poem by andrew young thank you thank you thank you for the great response to my last chapter i have to say i was paranoid that i would seriously screw up writing snape on the second date that why it took so long i was trying to make sure it was worthy of your attention hopefully the next one will go easier thank you to everyone who is reading and reviewing this story and thanks as always to vaughn hermione sighed happily as she snuggled deeper into the wonderfully warm blanket wrapped around her it was an incredible piece of work red and silver on one side and green and gold on the other embroidered with alternating snakes and lions around the edge with a hogwarts seal in the center severus gave it to her several days ago after she complained about not being able to get warm anymore it was made of thick brushed wool and bore a permanent warming charm she still felt amazed by the thoughtfulness of that simple gesture from her husband he was truly proving himself to be an amazing man two weeks had passed since their wonderful date in the gardenia room and every day had been filled with pleasant surprises from severus the day after their date he showed up at her room the next morning with breakfast and a beautiful orchid in a fluted crystal vase since then he made sure to do something thoughtful and surprising every day taking her to lunch showing her a new potion or spell he found gifting her with beautiful jewelry and clothes it was almost overwhelming at times but she appreciated his efforts small or large it was all wonderful thanks to him she now had a lovely bouquet of flowers one for each day since the date she was afraid at first that it was all an act that he was not being himself but then she sat back one night and thought very seriously about everything he had said and done the conclusion came to startled her ever since that day he had been different from the time he rushed in the door to beg for another chance to last night when he walked her to her room and kissed her goodnight he had been open to her like he finally took off the mask he wore for so long and was getting used to showing his true face he still was not anything other than a snarky bastard that did not change not that she wanted it to she loved that about him she loved his brilliance his honesty ironic for a slytherin bravery decency courtesy and incredible thoughtfulness and the snarkiness this was the severus she fell in love with this was the severus she could live with for the rest of her life she sent a silent prayer up to whatever power helped him find this side of himself so much darkness had been in his life that she had feared for some time that he was just too far gone she got the feeling that it had been close the last thing the world needed was a truly dark severus snape she shivered and then pushed the thought aside he was too strong to succumb to the darkness she thought he would be far more likely to end it all than allow himself to become the next dark lord fortunately it appeared things were getting better hermione looked down at the package in her hands it had been almost impossible for her to get away into hogsmeade for a short time without her husband hovering over her the attention was nice but really thankfully minerva had been willing to accompany her assuaging severus fears she had taken the opportunity to pick up a number of things including a book on fatherhood yes she was going to tell him it had only been only a month but she was more in love with him than ever and decided she did not want to wait any longer she had waited three years to hear him say that he loved her and she would be damned if she was going to waste any more time that and she wanted to get harry off her back if there was one thing that annoyed her as of late it had been the actions of her best friend she knew he just wanted to help but things were difficult enough without having to deal with his helpful advice and tips on romance yes she knew severus deserved reciprocated gestures yes she knew he needed to know about the baby and yes she understood that they had a lot of serious talking to do before making any major decisions thank you captain obvious she thought if harry said one more thing to her about it she was going to hex him bald less than a week ago he had come to her rooms to visit and wound up sitting by the fire with her nursing a firewhisky and resting his deep emerald eyes on her what is it harry mione have you told him yet she sighed no not yet to her surprise his face turned red with anger do you plan on waiting the whole three months he asked icily er i hadntreally thought about it harry i just welll i guess i was just enjoying the moment mione love you know i care for you more than my own life but believe me when i say that i beginning to get the urge to hex you har listen he hissed that man has been doing everything in his power to prove to you that he loves you and all you re doing is sitting back and enjoying the ride that not fair mione it not fair to him or to you or your child dontyou want him to be involved with your pregnancy he already missed enough stop punishing him for the past hermione stared at him in shock is that what he thought she was doing her face flushed with anger harry james potter you know very well that i am not taking out my anger on severus i then why are you hiding your pregnancy from him because i afraid she shouted because the last time i mentioned something he flew off the handle and threatened to strangle sniff any baby we might conceive together i love him harry but there a part of me that afraid he ll turn back in to the man that pinned me against the wall and she buried her face in her hands harry meanwhile looked at her stunned he had no idea things had gone that badly between her and snape she only mentioned that he yelled at her well and insulted her but not that bugger no wonder she was reticent he got up and went to kneel in front of her taking her small hands in his sometimes it was hard to forget how fragile she could be hermione had always been the strong one hermione love look at me he willed her to see the apology in his eyes i sorry i i didntknow things had gotten that bad why didntyou tell me she sniffed because i didntwant you going after him and getting hurt he gave her a lopsided smile hey dontforget mione i harry potter the boy who lived to become the man that killed the wizard formerly known as tom riddle hermione laughed you re incorrigible harry potter her eyes turned mischievous is there an abbreviation for that of course there is he leapt to his feet just call me the man harry had turned the subject to lighter things and they spent the evening relaxing and chatting about everything under the sun it was odd how that conversation had illustrated to her how much she truly loved her husband she and harry got along extremely well were she not married she would have jumped at the chance to try things out with him but she was with severus and he suited her far more than she ever imagined the two were a study of opposites and she loved them both harry though was more of a friend now maybe a potential brother than anything it would take work to see him as anything else the clock on her mantle hit seven o clock and began screaming at her to get down to the dungeons this morning she decided to surprise severus with breakfast in bed and she did not want to be late tossing a bit of floo powder she stuck her head in the fire and requested to see dobby he appeared moments later in the middle of her room what can dobby do for missus oh dobby you startled me no it okay i fine uh would it be possible for you to prepare a breakfast tray for me and professor snape and meet me down near his rooms of course missus hermione dobby would be happy to fix breakfast for missus and the professor what would missus like dobby to prepare er crepes with several varieties of fruit filling on the side hash browns eggs and juice for the two of us oh and a large pot of vanilla coffee she smiled what they would say if they knew about the potions master sweet tooth as soon as dobby left hermione quickly changed into one of the new nightgowns she purchased green silk with a matching gold and green brocade robe and pulled her hair up and back to cascade down her back in a waterfall of chestnut curls her black teaching robes went over the outfit it would not due to have a student see her dressed like this one quick glance in the mirror left her satisfied with her appearance and she headed off to the dungeons gift in hand severus snape opened his eyes and promptly felt the need to bury himself under the covers his wife was a beautiful wonderful woman but there are days when he regretted letting her talk him into having a window put in their room today was one of those days he glanced over at the clock seven bloody wonderful no matter how little sleep he got he still felt compelled to get up at an ungodly hour unless his wife was with him until these past few weeks he had never acknowledged how much she helped him relax on the rare occasions they slept together he would have been able to wrap himself around her still slumbering form and fall back asleep bugger last night he had stayed up until somewhere past four in the morning working on the all heal potion the dried dragon sprout worked far better than he thought it would and he now had what he thought was a working prototype he planned on testing it today with hermione she would kill him if he tried it without her he smirked she really was brilliant the past two weeks had flown by in a swirl of hard work interspersed with romantic interludes that made him feel like a giddy school boy like now he knew he was smiling that silly i love hermione smile that brought such joy to her face he was such a sap severus eyes drifted to the painting above his mantle there is a reason for that he thought the painting had been created the muggle way static and without movement but it was the most amazing piece of art he had ever seen it was a picture of him and his wife in their wedding clothes standing in the great hall hands joined the severus in the picture was leaning over slightly moments before he kissed his bride her face glowed with joy and now he could see with clear eyes the love she had already felt for him she was a truly talented artist severus was surprised to find out that his wife knew how to paint according to her it started out as a harmless hobby drawing in class as a youth to assuage boredom and then turned into a full fledged interest after an art class shortly before she came to hogwarts he joked about his wife being a know it all but there were times that he thought it was actually true was there anything she could not do hermione presented the picture to him less than a week ago after he invited her to his chambers for a nice quiet dinner for two apparently she started painting it several months ago using a pensieve containing the wedding memories of harry potter albus dumbledore minerva mcgonagall and the malfoys his heart almost burst with joy when he saw it and actually comprehended what she said our wedding is one of my most valuable memories severus it was the happiest day of my life i painted it hoping you would come to treasure it as much as i do her eyes were wide and vulnerable as she said it and he could do nothing but sweep her into his arms and kiss her until they were both weak kneed and breathless that was a train of thought he needed to derail right now his wife was not going to be ready for any serious resumption of intimacy for some time and remembering how her soft lips felt on his her gentle hands stroking his back running through his hair how her body fit perfectly against his he abruptly flung himself out of bed bugger she had no idea how the mere thought of her affected him catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror he grimaced no one with half a brain would be able to miss his state of arousal it was time to take a cold shower a soft knock on his door startled him and he quickly threw on a heavy robe making sure it covered strategic areas of his body the last thing he wanted to do was greet minerva mcgonagall at the door with a raging erection once more glance at his reflection confirmed his success at concealment and he flung open the door hoping he could get rid of the crazy old bat quickly his mouth fell open when he saw who was at his door hermione stood there in the hallway looking beautiful and absolutely edible garbed in the most incredible green nightclothes he had ever seen her hair was pulled back and cascaded down her back reaching halfway to her waist he itched to run his fingers through the soft curls if she had not been holding a tray of food in her hands he would have dragged her into his room and given her the snog of her life as it was he barely controlled himself her hermione darling i was not expecting you this morning how the bloody hell did she expect him to keep his hands off her when she looked like that may i come in he mentally slapped himself at the images crowding themselves into his head er of course my dearest let me take that he tried not to notice how her pink tongue flicked out to lick her lips in a nervous gesture thank you severus she said softly i hope you dontmind that i came down here this morning i wanted to surprise you with breakfast in bed but i forgot that you passworded your rooms i persephone what the password persephone she smiled fondly at him should i change mine to hades then he set the tray down and glided over to her if you wish i would prefer to change my wards to persephone and hades however silence hung between them as she suddenly realized what he was saying her eyes met his and again he found himself having difficulty interpreting the emotions he saw flickering in the amber orbs he was shocked when she placed her hand on his shoulder and pulled him closer he felt a surge of panic when he realized he would not be able to hide his state from her with her body against his preparing to push her away he found himself thunderstruck as she pulled his head down and kissed him passionately time ceased to exist from that moment forward does that answer your question she asked breathlessly another deep kiss was his only response severus she whispered yes love i she faltered as she realized she had no idea what to say hermione he asked his voice husky with emotion i we she was going to tell him his mind babbled excitedly pulling slightly away from her he held out his hand and gently tugged her back into the living area he never even realized they moved towards the bedroom he squirmed uncomfortably at the thought control severus she is not ready for that yet he admonished it warmed his heart when she took a seat on the couch and curled up next to him what is it love he asked softly i you remember the day we fought about children he grimaced the day he was an idiot how could i forget he said flatly severus severus look at me their eyes met you know i have forgiven you for that dontyou i maybe i should have found another way to bring it up no he barked startling her it was in no way shape or form your fault hermione so i suggest you get that noble gryffindor tripe out of your head right now he consciously made an effort to moderate his tone despite your constant need to take responsibility for all things hermione there will be times you are not at fault this is one of them it is my burden to bear alone i was the one spouting all that small minded garbage and you did nothing to deserve it i forgive you she repeated gently cupping his cheek his eyes widened in surprise and then searched hers for her true feelings what he found there humbled him severus crushed his wife to him not believing how incredible she was it had not occurred to him that he felt the need for absolution leave it to his beloved know it all to understand that before he did thank you you re welcome severus you know i can never stay angry with you forever he smirked you do realize love that you should never tell a slytherin about your weaknesses it not a weakness severus it is something that can be exploited she shrugged like you couldntfigure it out anyway harry knew by my second year that i was incapable of saying no to him and he wasntthe head of slytherin severus eyes darkened at the mention of his rival she snuggled closer it was difficult to remain angry with her when she had her head on his shoulder and her arms wrapped around his waist why was he angry anyway potter was not here nor was he enjoying the attentions of his beautiful and vibrant best friend she sighed contentedly you were saying love there was no way he was going to let her get out of this he was surprised at how much he yearned to shower yet more attention on her as the mother of his child accio gift the small package hermione brought with her flew into her hand and she waved her wand over it restoring it to its original size it appeared to be a book she turned to face him severus i someone with the most atrocious timing in the world knocked at the door before she could continue the moment was gone and it was all he could do not to scream with frustration he gently kissed his wife and then rose to stalk over to the door this had better be damn good p p professor stupid first year even if he was a slytherin what he asked voice cold as winter er s s something is wrong in the common room sir severus merely raised an eyebrow at the shaking boy th th the furniture s s sir it all red and gold silence reigned for a moment while severus glared incredulously at the idiot student you mean to tell me he began menacingly that you came to my room at eight o clock in the morning to tell me that the d cor of our furniture has been changed to reflect gryffindor house uh yes sir severus snapped get out go back to your room mr hathaway and get some more rest later this morning after breakfast you will go to the library and research the proper way to change the furniture back he instructed if you do not return it to its normal state by thursday morning you will serve a week detention with filch he eyed the frightened boy sternly you will not bother me about this pathetic drivel again you are a slytherin i expect you to act as such the boy nodded y yes s sir in a flash the boy was gone and severus turned back to his wife in relief the horrified look that greeted him spoke louder than words of the huge mistake he just made with his behaviour she stood up quickly i i have some things to take care of today severus i will see you later his wife was out the door before he could say a word taking the book with her he closed his eyes in resignation that went well hermione ran blindly through the hallways headed for her usual place of refuge harry potter rooms how could she have been so stupid romance was one thing it was wonderful to have a kind caring and attentive husband who showered her with attention unfortunately romantic inclinations did not mean he liked children any more than before she had forgotten how much he hated children in the warm haze of his tender demeanor bloody hell why did she think that he would be anything other than what he had always been severus never liked children not even when he was one she no longer thought he clung to the ridiculous prejudices of his youth as far as blood was concerned but how could she ignore his hatred of children harry was bleary eyed and just this side of sleep when he answered the door as soon as he saw the stricken look on his best friend face however he quickly flung himself into consciousness and invited her in what happened now he asked bluntly her stricken look prompted him to gently take her hand and kiss it in apology i sorry mione i just tired i sorry harry i should have waited to come until later no it okay love i wasntsleeping well anyway nightmares he shrugged the same old stuff you know how it is do you want to talk about it that was his hermione caring more for others than herself he shook his head i d rather talk about what brought you here to my room at this ungodly hour of the morning she sighed what else he nodded sagely what did snape do this time he i was an idiot harry mione i dontthink that possible she laughed oh it more than possible harry this is certainly not the first time okay how were you an idiot then let me ask you this do you think severus likes children god no he wait did you tell him did he flip out no and no mione harry began chastising her i was about to harry when some slytherin first year interrupted she replied defensively he merlin you know how he is he yelled at the boy for bothering him and then threatened him with detention if he didntfigure out how to reverse the prank himself prank it looks like someone in gryffindor managed to turn all the slytherin common room furniture red and gold harry laughed i wish we had thought of that one what am i supposed to do harry severus hates children i cantbring my child up in an environment like that her eyes turned dreamy he been wonderful lately but only to me he still acts the same around everyone else maybe the same will apply to your children he ll be different around his family she speared him with a glance and when they attend hogwarts how will it look to them if their father is a royal bastard to everyone else harry fell silent i suppose you have a point this isntgoing to work is it he just too angry and bitter to be anything but a git you forgot greasy harry sorry but seriously mione things might be different once the child is born you think i want to risk my child future on a maybe er good point what am i going to do harry i know he loves me i bet he could even love our child but what if he doesntchange the way he acts i dontwant him to pretend to be something else for my sake what about for your child sake mione not all parents are wonderful caring people like yours most of them are in between sometimes good sometimes not but they all ideally love their children and that what matters the slytherins dontseem to be too worse for wear from his behaviour it not acceptable harry i will not settle for the father of my child her eyes met his my child will be loved and cherished not yelled at for being a kid harry mind screamed at him to ask hermione to let him be that man but he was not the heir of gryffindor for nothing this time his nobility was threatened to choke him give him a chance mione he said softly his heart screaming in anguish snape deserves that at least tell him your concerns and let him know that if you find his behaviour inadequate you will leave that all there is to it hermione was silent as she considered harry was right she did feel severus had the right to know about their child her first appointment with st mungo was in two weeks and she really wanted the father of her child with her ginny offered to accompany her but she felt like it would be unfair to whomever she chose if they were excluded from this first and very important event bugger it sounded like she was making it a bloody competition to see who won the privilege of being her child father that certainly was not it she wanted it to be severus she wanted to stay with severus be his wife wake up with him go to sleep with him spend her life with him but she had other things to consider she did love harry but it was a love that could be easily turned into the deep abiding affections between siblings if they tried not so with severus she loved him with a deep passion that she had never felt for harry maybe if things had been different but the stupid marriage law ended that chance before it even began harry refused to do anything to make her a bigger target while voldemort was alive and now she was madly in love with severus what the bloody hell had she done to deserve this hermione found herself outside a short time later roaming around the lake before she turned her attention back to what she was doing it was a beautiful day out so she decided to continue walking around the lake while deep in thought this was something she needed to work out before she saw severus again severus in the meantime was sternly avoiding the almost overpowering urge to beat his head against the wall while taking the most deadly poison he could brew leopards never change their spots he thought that much was true as soon as he saw his wife face he knew she was thinking about how he would behave around their child he was mortified to realize he had not given it a lot of thought oh he read books on pregnancy and the process of childbirth he had even picked up a few books on parenting but somehow the advice contained in the pages never applied itself to how he treated his students suddenly albus questions about his plans for the future made a lot more sense teaching was something he had done out of necessity if he had been given the chance he would have joined the experimental potions department of the ministry or went to work for one of those potions brewing firms that offered top dollar to anyone up to his standard not that there were many he was one of less than a dozen potions masters in europe even before he graduated he had received a number of offers if only he had not ruined things by turning to that bloody madman in hopes of revenge against the world that rejected him becoming a spy was his penance but now that the war was over he was no longer required to keep up the pretense of being a hogwarts professor if he made his availability known no he was not willing to work for some petty minded bureaucrat from the ministry nor would he be satisfied playing lackey to some idiot manager with seniority in a company responsible for the upswing in potions prices after the war voldemort may have been many things but at least he was not greedy he left that to malfoy he sighed even he had his dreams and there had been one inside of him for years hidden deep where the dark lord would never find it freedom total and absolute freedom he wanted the freedom to choose his own course to decide what he created and how he created it to make the choice of where to purchase his own potions supplies and to whom he sold the finished products to be his own man without voldemort or dumbledore looming over him controlling his actions admittedly the headmaster was not nearly as intolerable as the infamous dark wizard but even now albus dictated where he spent his holidays and with whom what he did with a large portion of his free time where he lived and what potions he made or was forbidden to make during his years as voldemort premier potions maker he had discovered a number of very interesting potions that he thought could be incredibly useful to the world at large if only they were created without dark magic he thought hermione could help him figure out a way hermione that is what it all came down to even she held his future in her delicate little hands but at least she never tried to control him she left it up to him to control himself we saw how successful that was this morning he thought bugger knowing his wife she was already weeping on the shoulder of that messy haired prat wailing about his insensitivity and how he would make a terrible father would she be wrong asked the voice of sirius black severus hoped so he hoped he could avoid the mistakes his father made that molded him into the fallen wizard he became in his youth his child his daughter would never want for anything he vowed including a loving father if only hermione would give him a chance if only she would try to understand she was a gryffindor her noble sensibilities were wonderful but horribly misplaced in his house slytherins were a slippery bunch requiring an iron grip in order to remain on good behaviour that child should have gone to one of the prefects with that problem but in all probability had been directed to him by some sneaky housemate who wanted to get the boy in trouble there were few things a slytherin liked more than to provoke someone to react in an unguarded manner by reacting as he did he taught the child to rely on his own devices to solve problems and illustrated to him that blind trust was not something he wanted to practice his house had been in the lead for the cup for the majority of the years he had taught at hogwarts and much of it was testament to they way he kept his slytherins in check it took the advent of harry potter and his friends to unseat his house for seven years but now they were back at the top where they belonged he dropped into a chair and gazed forlornly into the fireplace he buggered it all up if he was lucky she would still tell him about the child and let him have some distant participation in her life but in all probability she was packing right now intending to run off with harry potter to the bloody united states he felt a surge of grief at the thought to never see his daughter birth her first steps hear her first words ugh what was happening to him he was not potter to revel in sentimentality but here he was wistfully wishing for something he would never have he was such a fool he never expected to hear potter voice confirm his thoughts you are a fool snape harry potter declared stepping out of his fireplace bloody hell he thought he blocked it against unwelcome visitors albus gave me the password i figured you would refuse to talk to me so i not giving you the option of saying no wonderful what do you want potter come to gloat what no snape i came to offer some advice i await your words with bated breath he said sarcastically harry frowned you know you make it very difficult for me to want to help you and why would you want to do that because hermione deserves to be happy and for some ungodly reason you seem to be the man she wants to be with harry glared at him daring the slytherin to say something for once severus decided to keep his mouth shut it might be interesting to see what the little bastard had to say for a horrendously brilliant man you really can be quite stupid is this little chat going somewhere or can i go and do something productive with my time like hex you shut it snape and listen harry chose his words carefully unwilling to reveal hermione pregnancy to her husband while he disagreed with her decision it was hers to make and he respected it i know you and hermione have had a number of difficulties in the past i also know one of them was due to her desire to have children your fight several weeks ago for example was prompted by her bringing up the subject he fixed the slytherin with a steely glare do you have any idea why your wife was upset with you this morning severus was taken aback potter was trying to counsel him in a very slytherin like oblique way he decided to play along he was not supposed to know about the baby anyway no potter i admit to a certain curiosity as to why she ran from my rooms directly to yours how did you treat that first year seeing as she told you about it i speculate you already know the answer to that question harry eyes narrowed with frustration then i imagine you can speculate how hermione must have felt about seeing your way with children at a time when she wants to have one she has always known of my feelings he sneered the word as far as children are concerned potter i fail to see why this discussion is meant to move me that would be because you really are the bastard you appear to be you know snape hermione was not meant to be a childless spinster living her life with a man old enough to be her father she was meant to be with someone who loves her as much as she loves him and is willing to sacrifice as much you ve never even made the attempt to be the man she needs you to be she wants to be a mother snape and it my understanding that you donthave much choice in the matter unless you want to marry some stranger in two years i suggest you take a good look at yourself and figure out how you are going to convince her that you are worthy to be the father of her children and if i don t then you dontdeserve the love she has given you you re pathetic snape you know that she gave you years of her life and you canteven be bothered to try and dontgive me that i ve treated her well bullshit this is about more than your ability to pretend to be romantic this is about her life he looked severus directly in the eye i will not allow you to continue screwing it up make a choice snape and stick with it harry whirled on his heel and flooed back to his office leaving a stunned potions master behind him severus was shocked at what he saw in the boy s no the man eyes it suddenly occurred to him that this was the man who defeated voldemort who stood up to the dark lord for seven years until he was ready to finally destroy him during all the time severus had put up with potter presence in his classes he had never truly looked at him he was surprised to find himself feeling a grudging respect after meeting the defense against the dark arts professor steely gaze potter did truly love his best friend and if severus was not careful would steal her away from him not if he could help it he needed to figure out a way to apologize to his wife without revealing his knowledge of the baby or betraying potter visit it would not do well for her to think the only reason he was sorry was that her best friend guilted him into it somehow he knew the bo man would not tell her about his visit a frantic search of the castle revealed that she was not inside fortunately he spotted her walking around the lake before he truly began to panic without thought he was striding toward her determined to make things right he wanted to be the father she needed him to be he needed it too he silently stepped behind her i feel like i owe you an apology but i would like to know what for first hermione whirled to face him s severus you startled me he smirked what are you doing here you first what you ran away this morning like an escaped prisoner from azkaban why i was it because of the way i treated that boy she nodded i thought things had changed since the war the more things change the more they stay the same he quoted change is the constant the signal for rebirth the egg of the phoenix she replied to change and change for the better are two different things hermione smiled all appears to change when we change change for the sake of change is dangerous he countered the universe is change our life is what our thoughts make it she stepped toward him nothing endures but change i do believe you violated the spirit of this challenge my darling that was two you would have gotten around to it eventually he smirked severus it is not easy hermione making such great changes in so short a time i in my wildest imaginings i never thought i would find a woman that would wish to bear my child he reached out and gently touched her cheek i was not treating that boy with unnecessary cruelty love it is how i act around my students to maintain discipline you frightened him he will recover hermione life is not full of sunshine and roses despite everything albus dumbledore would like the students to think i prepare my slytherins for the reality they will face not the fantasy they are shown mr hathaway will think twice from this point forward about bothering his head of house for trivial matters he will learn to respect the order of authority and will come to understand how important it is when he leaves hogwarts minerva doesn t i am not the head of gryffindor hermione the students are placed in their houses for a reason you were an exception the brains of a ravenclaw the loyalty of a hufflepuff and the cunning of a slytherin combined with the courage of a gryffindor she looked surprised at that i imagine the sorting hat felt a bit of a quandary about where to place you it chose well though you do fit in gryffindor thank you severus he nodded preferring to mean it as a compliment you re welcome he pulled her close wrapping his arms around her the way minerva treats her students works because of who and what they are hermione a slytherin would be very quick to take advantage of that she thought about it for a moment and then comprehension dawned you have to be stricter with them because they would run all over you if you weren t now you are getting it that doesntexplain the cruelty bugger no hermione it doesn t i can only say that it is what i am used to perhaps it is time for me to learn a different way he thought about the books on childrearing he purchased and vowed to read them as soon as possible or perhaps it is time for a greater change he murmured what shit he had not meant to say that out loud er what change severus here have a seat and we can talk about it this is something that involves you assuming you uh well i would like to talk with you before making a decision severus led her over to a nearby tree and transfigured some leaves into a blanket and some pillows she eyed him curiously as he seated himself her eyebrow arched so i er albus asked me an interesting thing the other day she waited patiently for him to continue he uh wanted to know if er bloody hell he sounded like a nervous first year pull it together snape he wanted to know if i was happy teaching at hogwarts there no verbal fumbling i see it was obvious she expected him to continue i ve been thinking it over since then and i have found myself wondering if it would be better for me to leave hogwarts for something else to do something else she looked surprised like what like raise our child it has always been a bit of a fantasy of mine to have my own potions making business i have a number of patents out there as well as a fairly long list of potions i ve created over the years some of them i would need your help to change the methods of creation he noticed her puzzled look some of them require the dark arts to create ah they are highly beneficial but very illegal will we be able to do the research all potions masters have a license from the ministry to do research in all avenues of magic involving potions as long as i do not kill anyone or use unforgivables i can experiment to my heart content he smirked why do you think voldemort wanted a potions master for his lab she nodded i see so what are your plans i have enough contacts in the commercial wizarding world to gain several customers to start with we can make use of them in the beginning and expand outward as our reputation spreads our i had hoped you would be willing to be a part of this hermione i i d like that severus but i really do love teaching then teach there is no need for you to be there all the time i can stay at home and do research and make potions while you are here at hogwarts donti have to live here not necessarily once you get your potions mastery and albus hires you to take my place i sure he will appoint someone else to head slytherin house and you will be free to live wherever you want why do you think you hardly ever see the other professors minerva stays here because albus is here sinistra has no need to be anywhere else nor does flitwick nor i but the others do not live here at the school i hadntrealized she murmured st mungo would definitely be a place to begin looking for a buyer for your potions your cruciatus treatment alone would be invaluable and once you finish the all heal potion ah that reminds me my dear this afternoon you have an appointment in the dungeons i do unless you have no desire to see the results of my trial her eyes grew wide and she smiled at him excitedly of course i want to see it i want to see all of your tests she reached out and took his hand i want to be part of every aspect of your life severus if you ll let me severus felt his heart flutter at her soft words he squeezed her hand i do hermione i want you to be part of everything her smile if possible grew even more brilliant he brought her hand to his lips speaking of everything dontbugger this up he thought were you serious when you asked if i wanted children her eyes widened in surprise oh uh yes severus i was quite serious you ve only been out of school for three years hermione we have to produce a child within the next two years anyway severus wouldntyou rather wait how long was she going to be able to avoid telling me he wondered she shook her head not really by the time er i am finished with my training i ll be ready for a long term job at hogwarts i d really like to be settled into a routine before then he nearly applauded she certainly has embraced her inner slytherin he observed even he would be hard pressed to provide such a glib answer he moved closer and pulled her into his lap and when would you like to begin this family hermione she shivered as his warm breath puffed against her ear and his velvet voice reverberated through her body uh she tried to focus her thoughts on something other than saying right now and tackling him er soon how soon he whispered uh very soon he brushed his lips against the sensitive spot under her ear it was all she could do not to moan with pleasure now perhaps she bit back another moan at the thought er she struggled to collect her thoughts was there something she wanted to tell him wha what about your plans for a potions business i believe we can manage my dearest perhaps things will be better if one of us is at home with our child who would have thought he would offer to be a stay at home husband she was surprised i i dontwant you to sacrifice anything her voice trailed off as his lips grazed her neck there is nothing i would not sacrifice for you or our child love but it would be no sacrifice it would be my pleasure to watch her grow up and be there for her as my parents never were her hermione asked weakly he kissed her neck i like the idea of having a daughter he replied softly er her thoughts became even more jumbled as he ran his hands up her sides and moved to gently take her shoulders and pull her closer his velvet voice caused her to shiver perhaps we should get right on that my dear he stroked her cheek moving down to run his fingers along her chin and neck now is the perfect time to begin our new family surprise flickered in her mind and suddenly brought her back to reality hermione mind finally began working again and she remembered the whole point to her actions this day she gently pulled away and placed herself out of his reach merlin did she love him but he could distract her like no one else pull yourself together granger she thought wait did her inner voice sound like draco malfoy severus was disappointed when his wife pulled her hand away moved farther from him keeping at a safe distance she was flushed from his attentions and he could see the familiar glint in her eye that promised a night of passion if he played his cards right she took a deep breath severus we need to talk uh oh that was never good about uh well what we were just talking about sex he almost laughed at the expression on her now flaming red face no well no not exactly what then my darling he made sure her attention focused on talking with him as he crept closer er oh bloody hell severus i dontknow how to say this his conscience chose that moment to make a rather irritating appearance and he felt the need to comfort her he took her hand what is it love uh well i got something for you again she took out the book and enlarged it this time however she handed it to him he eyed her curiously may i ask what this is for it s a gift severus just open the bloody thing he smirked your wish is my command darling knowing it would drive her to distraction he carefully began to unwrap the present mimicking her chosen method for opening gifts by the time he was finished he could feel the tension thrumming in his wife body once he saw what was in the package however he found himself struggling to keep the tears from showing in his eyes a wizard guide to fatherhood he turned to gaze at her in wonder congratulations severus you re going to be a daddy she said softly despite the fact that he knew despite the fact that he had seen his daughter birth with is own eyes he could not help but feel overwhelmed by the experience of finding out that his wife was pregnant he knew he was grinning like an idiot but he honestly could care less at that moment all he could do was grab hermione and hug her to him thank you love he whispered into her hair her eyes were wide and vulnerable as she looked at him you mean it truly never have i received a better gift hermione i he stroked her hair i understand why you were angry this morning i just dontwant our child to suffer severus she will not she flashing back to his time in the future he smirked just hoping she pulled back slightly adjusting her position so she could look at him while sitting in his lap well we can find out for sure in two weeks oh that when my first appointment with the healer is if we want they can tell us then do you do you want me to go with you hopefully he did not look as pathetic as he sounded a brilliant smile lit her face i was going to ask ginny but if you want to go i d rather you be there he eyed him shyly he gently raised her hand to his lips it would be my pleasure the rest of the day was spent in a state of stunned bliss for the both of them as they discussed possibilities for the future and their relationship severus never imagined he could be so happy sorry it wasntanother date guys but i figure i made up for it by finally letting hermione tell severus about the baby dontworry however you have not seen the last of romantic snape i have a number of things planned for our intrepid heroes and i hope you will continue to read and enjoy the quotes severus and hermione used can be found on the quotations page and in no way can be accredited to my powers of creativity leraiv i appreciate the compliment i do try and make sure everyone can see what i do when i writing as for snape being too nice i can see your point but since this is going to be one of my shorter stories i trying to move things along dontworry he still has some stuff to deal with but it will probably be far less than many stories i ve read and then there his near death experience speaking as one who knows it can truly change a person outlook and behaviour very quickly darkforces this is probably going to go on for another 2 5 chapters before an epilogue so dontworry i have no intentions of stopping until this is done happy holidays everyone sorry for the wait i sure you all know how difficult it is to avoid real life sometimes i appreciate all the support bookgal4000 i afraid there will be no lemons on perhaps after i finish the story i may go back and flesh out some of the scenes and post the higher rated story elsewhere but i wontwrite lemons for ffn my apologies thanks for continuing to read and review and thanks as always to vaughn hermione strolled into the lab trying her best not to bounce from excitement severus was going to test the all heal potion today and she was breathless with anticipation he had been working on it for a very long time and she knew its success was important to him the potion was a step toward curing the longbottoms of the damage done by the cruciatus it would most certainly be beneficial to st mungo s severus strode purposefully into the room stopping only to drop a gentle kiss on his wife lips he removed the potion from the storage rack and silently handed it to her for examination the liquid was iridescent gold and appeared to have the consistency of gravy magical sparkles whorled in its depths testimony to its power she regarded her husband in awe despite his depreciating foolish wand waving comments at the beginning of each year he excelled at charms the incantation to empower the potion was very complex while hermione studied the potion severus prepared for the test today subject was a very ill feline he purchased from a shop in knockturn alley previous trials had shown that the magical elixir would work on rats and mice but nothing so large as the dying panther that lay in the next room had he still worked for voldemort it would have been easy to find a mortally wounded human to test the potion on but those days were long gone a good thing too he thought if this trial worked he was going to speak with st mungo about using the potion on a willing patient perhaps this might be the way for him to finally atone for his past hermione returned the vial and followed him into the adjacent room there on a gurney rested a severely injured panther severus knew he needed to administer the potion quickly before the animal expired it was a victim of unwarranted cruelty having been hexed almost to death by a young man with authority issues hopefully he enjoyed his brief sojourn in azkaban unfortunately the likelihood of the boy learning his lesson was very small the young man was unrepentant and seemed to possess many of the qualities severus himself had when he was younger when he joined the death eaters turning his attention to the task at hand severus braced himself for the sight of the wounded creature he heard his wife gasp as he removed the cloth covering the animal wide gashes and severe burns covered the poor beast and they could both see where it had been stabbed in the chest that wound was the deepest and the most threatening to the panther snape glanced at his wife as he prepared to remove the stasis charm he could see horror reflected in her eyes along side a fierce hope that the potion would work finite incantatum severus intoned the panther immediately started gasping weakly struggling for breath a sense of urgency permeated the lab they both knew that the creature had only moments left to its life and that the potion was the only hope the poor beast had severus deftly pried open its jaws and poured the shining liquid down its throat the fact that it barely struggled spoke louder than words for its condition hermione gasped in wonder as a gentle golden light bathed the panther he felt a surge of victory as the wounds began to close and heal over the panther breathing eased and they could see the dull eyes clear it was exactly as he had hoped a normal healing draught would have been able to do very little for a creature so close to death hermione squealed with joy and threw herself into her husband arms you did it severus you really did it he smiled indulgently as she peppered his face with kisses and squeezed him within an inch of his life severus decided to interrupt her unrestrained excitement with his lips and soon the couple was locked in a passionate embrace kissing ardently their hands frantically roaming all over each other body a spark of intelligence roused him to remember that a newly healed panther was now dozing in his lab he quickly waved his hand to cast a restraining charm and then swept his wife up into his arms still kissing her he kicked open the door to his chambers and carried her to the bedroom having hermione in his bedroom again was like coming home he had missed her terribly and every morning had hoped she would agree to come back to him after the fiasco with the hathaway boy she decided she needed a little more time to get used to the idea of living with him again today was like a dream come true hopefully they would be moving her things back into the dungeons very soon but for now he was content to have her in his arms she was voicing no objections to her location so he gently set her down in front of the bed and began raining kisses down on her head face neck and shoulders her sigh of pleasure urged him to continue and he moved lower confident that his wife was wordlessly giving him permission to make love to her the way he wanted to for months it was an amazing experience for them both severus put great effort into making her first experience back with him as incredible as their first time together he was surprised when she reciprocated the effort bringing both of them to greater heights of passion than ever before afterwards when they lay together near sleep bodies intertwined he whispered to her his love for her and reveled at the feeling of her in his arms i love you hermione i will always love you warmth permeated his body as she snuggled closer i love you too severus she replied sleepily they fell asleep together and for the first time in a long time severus slept the night through with no nightmares the next morning he woke up to find his wife securely in his arms he almost felt like he was dreaming a few short months ago this would have been cause for embarrassment and anger he would have rudely awakened her and then kicked her out with the admonition to make sure she found her own bed the next time now however things were different he knew that she loved him as much as he loved her and more importantly knew the damage his treatment of her had done he never hated her which is why he had agreed to marry her in the first place but now he had to admit that he never allowed himself to see her for the incredible woman she was the image in his head had still been that of a bossy bushy haired know it all with the unfortunate tendency to hang out with james potter son he studied her in the soft morning light and recognized that he had kept himself from seeing her for his own protection he never thought she could love him and the last thing he wanted was to fall for her ironically enough he did so without realizing it and it was only through the determined interference of his school nemeses that he discovered the truth now he was never going to let her go hermione sighed in her sleep content for the first time in a long time gentle hands stroked her hair as she languidly dozed in bed her lips curved into a smile as she rolled over moving closer to the nearby warmth she felt strong arms embrace her before allowing sleep to overtake her again secure in the knowledge that she was protected and loved it was late morning before she awoke again to her surprise severus was still there in bed with her his right arm wrapped around her as the left turned pages in a book levitating in front of him her natural curiosity prompted her to look at the cover before scooting into a better position for cuddling with her husband morning he rumbled good morning i see you re reading your gift considering your first appointment at st mungo is in less than two weeks i thought i might begin preparing now he turned to look at her did you know that wizarding babies have the capacity to do magic from birth but are restricted by the amount of magical energy in their bodies she shook her head no but it would explain a lot about harry he frowned what do you mean shortly after the war you remember that i went to visit the dursley and fetch all of harry things yes i talked with petunia she seemed to feel the need to speak with someone about harry and i thought it would be nice to listen to what she had to say she told me about some of the odd things that happened when harry was a baby apparently he was actually doing magic from the time of his parents deaths that is unusual but not unheard of in wizards as powerful as he exactly you know what that means dontyou he raised an eyebrow please enlighten me we need to make sure the baby room is heavily shielded against magic severus narrowed his eyes you are assuming a lot hermione severus she said exasperated we are two of the most powerful wizards in britain it is quite unlike you to be falsely modest surely you can expect that our child is going to inherit our magical abilities true he replied his manner superiour it was then that she realized he was teasing her will wonders never cease she laughed and hugged him you severus snape are a cad her lips brushed his i love you for it you know he smirked i know her lips found his again and he was delighted at her enthusiastic initiative one kiss led to another which led to far more intimate activities the rest of the morning passed in a pleasurable whirlwind for them both hermione moved back into the dungeons with her husband later that day he gave her a wordless invitation to stay in his room upon her arrival and the sheer joy on her face was enough to cause him a shy smile they planned to convert her old room into a nursery while she unpacked they discussed plans for its d cor he wanted a more traditional pure blood look dark furnishings and walls with little cheer while she had images of colorful walls and carpets with fanciful mobiles hanging from the ceiling it was obvious they would need to take some time to plan and compromise so instead they concentrated on getting hermione things put away knowing she liked the color green but was not obsessed with it he changed the bed linens with a flick of his wand to a deep navy the silver accents stayed but now the room looked less like the haven of the head of slytherin and more like the chambers of a married man her lips quirked at the change and he could tell she was amused at the lack of red in the room he loved her but he refused to transform his rooms into a haven of gryffindor even for her after her things were put away she came over and wordlessly thanked him for his efforts and then offered to fix dinner for him in payment never one to turn down his wife food she was an incredible cook after all he gladly accepted and settled down by the fire with the latest ars alchemica while she busied herself in his small kitchenette soon the delicate scent of garlic and shrimp wafted to him he smiled at her memory of his favorite food dinner was a pleasurable affair filled with interesting conversation and meaningful pauses and afterward she joined her husband by the fire with her own book the tone of the evening set the atmosphere for many nights to come and the next two weeks passed in an enjoyable blur they spent the time getting reacquainted as well as discovering new things about each other and their fledgling relationship severus was truly happy for the first time in his life and it was with excited trepidation that he waited for his wife first appointment for the baby he knew it was supposed to be a girl but it took some effort to convince hermione to ask about their child gender i d rather be surprised severus i d rather be prepared hermione she sighed exasperated severus the baby clothes mum gave me can be used for either boys or girls and we can easily transfigure the gifts we get into something usable based on our child gender severus looked scandalized hermione snape we will do no such thing transfiguring a gift is the height of rudeness we will either accept what our friends give us and use it as it is or we ask for nothing at all i refuse to be an uncouth barbarian just because your muggle upbringing has taught you nothing about proper society he could tell by the look on her face that he just said the wrong thing really she asked coldly my muggle upbringing is responsible for me being an uncouth barbarian hermione i ll have you know severus that bill and fleur had absolutely no problem changing the colors of some of their gifts to match the d cor of their new house seeing as they are pure blood wizards like you they are nothing like me he spat the weasleys are the dregs of pure blood society while the snapes are one of the most powerful and ancient families in existence we can trace our lineage back to that of salazar slytherin i refuse to allow you to drag down her face flushed in anger drag down well snape maybe you should have thought of that before you married me i not a pure blood and in case you missed the owl neither is our child you cantexpect me to blindly follow ever bloody tradition you pull out of the air without discussing it first we are in this together our child may be a half blood but she will still be a snape i refuse to allow allow get a clue severus you re not in the position to allow much of anything i only here because you asked me to give you another chance if you think that means that i will bow down to your every whim then you ve got another thing coming she whirled and stomped out the door pausing enough to make sure it slammed satisfactorily severus threw his glass across the room with an inarticulate growl of frustration that maddening woman how could she possibly want their child to be bereft of the proud heritage of the family snape bugger throwing himself into his chair severus picked up his discarded book and began determinedly reading maybe constance abrus would have some advice on how to handle this hermione stormed out of the dungeons instinctively heading for harry quarters suddenly she stopped the realization that she was perpetuating the cycle hitting her like a bludger the last thing that her best friend needed was to hear a rant on severus stubborn propensity for pure blood superiourity regarding their child if she was going to make things work with him she needed to figure out how to deal with his quirks on her own instead of continuing down the corridor to the defense against the dark arts hallway she turned and headed outside for a nice relaxing walk around the lake she needed to be walking anyway and it was such a nice day she knew her husband was used to getting his way in nearly all things what he did not receive for being the pure blood heir to the snape family empire he was able to procure through intimidation she refused to submit to him on this issue but perhaps she should speak with him about a compromise a surge of guilt hit her as she remembered her words to him about her reasons for staying with him it was not true that she was remaining with him only because she wanted to give him a second chance she was with him because she loved him and wanted to spend the rest of her life with him what was it about that man that could make her lose her head like that hermione sighed frustrated we really need to figure out how to work things out better she muttered i agree she whirled to see the tall form of her husband leaning against a nearby tree bugger that man was silent severus what are you doing here the same as you i imagine thinking about our latest conflict severus i sorry i shouldnthave he straightened and strode over to her i should not have assumed you would mindlessly follow my every whim i he struggled for a moment i apologize mirth lit her face why severus i never thought i would see the day your flippancy is unnecessary woman he growled i was trying to make amends for my arrogance she wiped the smile from her face i sorry severus i was just trying to lighten the mood she reached up and gave him a gentle kiss there maybe that would have been better her delicate hand reached out for his shall we he nodded they began walking after some thought hermione broke the silence i suppose my main issue is that i dontwant to completely ignore my muggle heritage in favor of your pure blood traditions i value my birthright severus i am muggle born and very proud of that fact as you well should be i guess i can capitulate on one issue and agree that we should find out the gender of the baby at the very least it will be a lot easier to decorate knowing what we are expecting but i refuse to agree to any other traditions until we discuss them i am willing to consider your customs as valid as mine but i will not blindly consent to something i know nothing about severus pulled his wife to him and kissed her gently then perhaps i can compromise and take into consideration the traditions of your family as well he stopped and turned to gaze at her i know our child is not a pure blood hermione that not what matters to me she or he is going to be the heir to the snape legacy i would like to think that our child will be the beginning of a new sort of nobility so to speak that will take into account family and ability over the purity of blood hermione looked at him curiously severus why do i get the feeling that i know very little about the snapes true position in wizarding society i mean i researched it when we got married but the only thing i could find was a family tree and some basic information on snape manor he smirked there is a lot of information that is not to be found in books my dear you would have been far better off asking my godson for information since information on societal influence and power is to be found in the minds of other pure bloods i dont understand it considered vulgar to brag about one influence hermione committing that information to print is the worst form of bravado and appalling bad taste he shrugged it also pretty much changes daily and is based almost entirely on the perceptions of other pure bloods the malfoys for example have always been considered the princes of the wizarding world thanks to voldemort many otherwise respectable families have taken damage to their reputations which of course affect their influence lucius was very good at maintaining the perception that the malfoys were still upstanding citizens of wizarding britain it was only at the end of the war when he could no longer hide his activities that the malfoys lost significant amounts of political and social power what about the snapes thanks to my father our reputation took a severe plunge during the time before mr potter birth my bad choices certainly did not help things any nor did my incredible lack of social graces you my dear have honestly done more to repair our reputation than anything i did even as a spy i certainly hoped it helped perhaps if that idiot minister had actually recognized my efforts but without the order of merlin everything i did was rendered moot there are still far too many questions about my true motivations for changing sides in the war even avery believes i did it to save my own skin hermione snorted that certainly isntwhat he said at his trial i believe traitor was the nicest thing he had to say about you his rich laugh filled the air indeed it was i imagine the difficulty was in the minister trying to decipher the multisyllabic words he used to insult me i believe his brain was almost ready to explode by the end of the trial she grinned warmth suffusing her at the sound of her husband laugh he really did have a wonderful laugh deep and rich like dark chocolate it made her want to melt in his arms following a reckless impulse she stopped walking and tightened her grip on his hand the abrupt stop caused him to unbalance slightly and she took advantage of that to pull him into her arms it was only thanks to his incredible dexterity that he did not fall on her hermione what she grabbed the front of his robes and pulled his head down to meet his lips in a passionate kiss all his objections were forgotten as he felt his wife tongue brush his lips and he eagerly opened to her deepening the kiss his arms wrapped around her of their own volition and it was only a matter of moments before he had the urge to sweep her up into his arms and carry her back to their rooms the best part of a fight is making up she whispered needing no other prompting severus swung his wife up and carried her back to the castle there were many benefits to his spying activities over the past twenty years and one of them was a near encyclopedic knowledge of hogwarts secret rooms and passages moving quickly so they were not seen by the students severus carried his wife through a passage leading to the stairs up to the east tower a slight twitch of his finger made her weightless and he kept her in his grip as he climbed the steps upon reaching the top he set her down and moved to cancel the spell she stopped him with a shake of her head i have another idea severus eyes sparkling wickedly hermione divested both of them of their clothes and climbed back into his arms it did not take a genius to figure out what she wanted hermione and severus spent the rest of the evening making up for their earlier argument the problems between them ended for the moment the next day severus groaned as he clawed his way out of sleep his body had not felt this sore since the heady days of voldemort when he was more likely to be tortured at a meeting than not at least the soreness was cause by much more pleasurable pursuits his gaze drifted to his somnolent wife there was a small smile on her face more like a smirk he thought and her body pressed against his as she slept once again he marveled at the fortune that gifted him was such an incredible gift or gifts rather in his mind eye he could see the dark beauty that was their daughter he could hardly fathom the feelings that filled him at the mere memory of her in hermione arms who knew an evil old former death eater like him could feel such emotion for another human being it made him wonder how lucius went wrong with his own son he resolved to make sure that things would be better with his own children children oh hell what was he thinking children as in child plural more than one when did his thoughts go from accepting the birth of his daughter to looking forward to the births of her siblings his lips curved into a gentle smile as he regarded his wife oddly enough the thought thrilled him their children would be amazing he knew and the wizarding world would never be the same perhaps that would be his legacy as the only living snape he could give the world his and hermione children after bringing them up with her sense of justice and his sense of honor he could teach them how slytherin house should have been from the beginning suddenly he was anxious for their daughter to be born so they could start making more bugger it all did he just think that severus hermione sleepy voice jerked him back to reality er yes love are you all right fine my dear why do you ask she chuckled you have the oddest look on your face like someone hit you in the back of your head and you werentexpecting it there was no way in the nine hells that he was going to tell her what he was thinking i uh i was thinking about how beautiful you are he lowered his lips to hers and how much i would like to make love to you at this moment she blushed i certainly wouldntobject and that thought severus is that later that day hermione and severus apparated outside the large and imposing building that was st mungo hospital it was not as tall as hogwarts but was spread out over a large piece of land that could easily serve as a home to the school a soft carpet of green grass covered the area dotted with small stands of trees and bushes beds of flowers formed a colorful accent to the white building lending cheerfulness to an otherwise stark environment he was surprised when hermione clutched at his hand upon their arrival and flashed him a nervous smile it was somewhat of a relief to him that she was just as anxious as he molly told me that mediwitches can check everything about the baby with a simple healer spell chattered hermione i so glad i wonthave to go through the process of having an ultrasound that a muggle procedure that allows the doctor and parents to view an image of the baby it not a difficult process but it takes time and i would much rather be using the time more productively do you think we re going to have a girl or a boy i actually hoping for a girl although i ll be happy with either but i ve always dreamed of having a little girl to spoil i know most people wouldntthink of me as the girly type but there something about being able to play dress up and dollies with a little girl that i severus knew his wife talked incessantly when she was uneasy unlike the times when she was excited or interested in sharing knowledge her nervousness caused her to spout off whatever came into her mind until someone usually him felt ready to hex her she had every reason to be anxious but did she really have to babble like a first year hufflepuff knowing he needed to do something severus halted and pulled his wife to him stopping her nervous rambling with his lips she stiffened for a moment and then relaxed into his embrace responding enthusiastically to his ministrations the couple stood there for a time wrapped in each other as other visitors to the hospital passed them by there were a few shocked looks by the more conservative witches and wizards but most of the passers by smiled indulgently at the sight of the lovers reality paused for severus and hermione as they comforted each other without words gently assuaging the other apprehension hermione glazed look spoke louder than words of her husband success she no longer felt nervous instead she began to feel a slow burning excitement at the prospect of today visit her eyes met his and she was thrilled beyond words to see love shining there it was all she could do not to pull him into another kiss and never let him go she smiled wryly thanks severus i guess i was getting a bit annoying a bit she stuck her tongue out at him before dragging him toward the hospital come on darling we need to get to the third floor so we can sign in for the appointment hermione led her husband through the dimly lit corridors of st mungo hospital the medical center was spacious with wide corridors for the easy transport of patients and cheerful colors muted by the faint light but friendly nonetheless severus counted three separate waiting rooms on their way to the lifts and noticed that the people inside appeared to be anxiously awaiting word of their loved ones the first floor was typically used for the more immediate medical issues he hoped he never had cause to visit the hospital for such a reason hermione pressed the button next to a shiny steel door off the major walkway the door slid open to reveal a small room plainly appointed in blue green and eggshell white severus frowned at the d cor what was it with all these annoying colors he supposed they were meant to be soothing but all they did to him was cause irritation it was like being in a giant bathroom they stepped into the lift healer brommel is the mediwitch assigned to us she will be doing my monthly checkups and making sure everything is going the way it supposed to what about poppy she ll be taking care of the day to day aspects of my pregnancy and will probably be our midwife it all depends on how well the pregnancy goes severus gave his wife a worried glance what do you mean my mother didnthave the easiest time with me the doctor had to deliver me by cesarean because i was turned the wrong way madame pomfrey was the one that suggested i see a healer regularly to make sure she not missing anything she ll be there during the birth although it will be poppy delivering the baby now that he thought about it he did seem to remember seeing a strange woman watching the birth of his daughter he had simply been too distracted by his wife condition at the time he held on to the image of her successful birth pushing aside the image of hermione having major problems hopefully the future did not change that much if severus thought the first floor was an exercise in bad taste he felt ready to gag at the sight awaiting them upon stepping out of the lift st mungo department of midwifery was the epitome of hell as far as severus snape was concerned even albus dumbledore at his most garish would be hard pressed to match the bright pastel vulgarity displayed in the waiting room of what was supposedly one of the most respected medical facilities in the wizarding world he was seriously starting to question that hermione blissfully unaware of the revolting display strolled into the room directly to the nurses station while severus looked on in horror she picked up a stack of papers and blithely sat down in a chair covered in powder blue and rosy pink flowers a stern look pulled him reluctantly into the room and he gingerly sat down next to her and began answering questions a flick of her wand filled out the first form and it was not too long before she was finished completing the questionnaires every once in a while hermione would look at him curiously before she quietly asked him for the answer and then moving on to the next question some of the questions were very intrusive and even he an ex death eater found himself blushing at some of the queries have you ever been to a prostitute what have you ever i heard the question hermione what the hell do they need to know that for disease severus they want to make sure there no chance of disease if you went to yes yes i get the idea he looked away ashamed at the memory yes recently her voice broke slightly at the question er define recently in the past five years uh yes silence severus shifted uncomfortably and turned to look at his wife when the soft question almost took him by surprise do you really want to know hermione i was it while we were married he caught her eyes yes but it was not a successful venture she smiled humourlessly i imagine not the fidelity charm is rather powerful he could tell she was fighting the urge to yell at him it was our second anniversary wasntit what how the hell did she know that when i found you drunk i always wondered if there was something more draco never talked about it but i could tell you really hacked him off that night a lot more than what could be justified by a simple drinking binge oh bugger i i sorry love i was i tried to do it i wanted to forget you us for one night nothing happened except a rather messy and disgusting kiss i left immediately afterward she looked into his eyes weighing him severus was relieved when she nodded apparently finding what she was looking for i understand severus just dontever do that again he deftly plucked the wand out of her hand and twinned his fingers with hers never i have too much to lose i promise hermione i will never betray you her smile was a balm to his soul i know severus thank you she took a deep breath and turned back to the form okay so that a no on the intercourse question i take it there were no other incidents no only that once you are the only one i have been with for the past five years really really and you are certainly the only one worth remembering for the past forty two hermione blushed thank you severus he handed back her wand and placed a gentle kiss on her lips anytime love none of the other questions were nearly as damaging and the pair quickly finished filling out the stack of forms while hermione took them up to the desk severus watched her lithe form still amazed that she wanted to be with him it was odd how much of a relief it was to have finally told her about that night if only they had talked sooner if only he had opened his eyes if only he was not a total git there nothing for it now he thought now was the time to make things up to his wife and make sure she and his daughter were well provided for he felt himself smile as he regarded her it was far enough in her pregnancy to see a small curve to her belly that would quickly grow into a beautiful roundness he was excited at the prospect of being with his wife as their baby grew and became more active and aware of the world around her fortunately after today hermione would know they were having a daughter and he would no longer have to watch his words a nurse stepped into the waiting room scanning the patients hermione snape hermione glanced nervously at her husband and then stood severus placed his hand on her waist as they headed over to the waiting nurse she frowned at his approach obviously not approving of his accompaniment of his wife unfortunate he thought but meaningless he was not about to let hermione face this alone tossing the woman a dark scowl he moved closer to hover protectively near his wife the disapproving witch sniffed and then motioned for the couple to follow her they were led to a room where the angry nurse weighed and measured his wife and then took a blood sample hermione seemed surprised at that but severus knew it was normal in cases of muggle born mothers there was a much higher risk of difficulties than with half blood or pure blood witches he wondered why that was healer brommel will join you shortly as soon as the surly nurse left hermione giggled she seemed rather upset i do believe she was not happy to see me or that was a stethoscope in her pocket it took severus a moment but he got the reference hermione jane snape i shocked appalled abhorred stunned outraged offended upset and taken aback severus my love you ve been reading too many thesauruses surely you haventbeen thinking i was an innocent all these years not with harry ron and draco for friends he smirked good point i would say however that i am surprised you do not usually make vulgar references i also usually not this nervous humour helps me relax severus eyes twinkled wickedly i can help you relax that dear husband is how we got here in the first place practice my dear for the next hermione eyes widened in shock r really he had not meant to say that but in for a penny really severus pulled her to him i would be honored hermione if you would consent to be the mother of more of my children i would honestly prefer to not try and outpace the weasleys but i believe i might be able to countenance one or two more severus expected a positive response but he did not expect his wife to leap into his arms and begin covering his face with kisses thank you severus a light peppering of kisses i love you so much more kisses i would love to be the mother to all your children severus her lips latched on to his and quickly pulled him into a passionate kiss i see the two of you are getting along well observed a wry voice dazed severus pulled away from his clinging wife to regard the smiling matron standing in the doorway i do hope i am not interrupting anything er no healer not at all he gently disentangled himself from his wife and gave a courteous bow healer brommel i presume you presume well master snape and you must be mrs snape she held out her hand still blushing hermione shook it yes healer thank you for seeing us a pleasure my dear i assure you poppy tells me this is your first child yes madam and i see by your form that you are twenty one years old hermione nodded my birthday is in september and you master snape are forty two severus nodded trying not to feel like a lecherous old man good it nice to see such a happy young couple young have the two of you decided on living arrangements hermione looked puzzled for a moment and then realized the healer knew they were married because of the ministry law uh yes severus and i are living at hogwarts separate or joined chambers severus answered hermione and i are staying together in our bedroom and the child will have her own room nearby the healer nodded good very good i glad to see the two of you are doing so well most couples i see these days live almost separate lives thanks to that ruddy law snape frowned that was news the prophet kept reporting that the marriages were doing well and that couples were happy and satisfied with their situations interesting we re very fortunate healer severus and i have known each other for a while and were already somewhat close when we were married i imagine it has been rather difficult for those who were married to complete strangers oh goodness yes i honestly cantimagine what the ministry has been thinking with this mess forcing people into arranged marriages what on earth did we fight you know who for if it meant we took away the people freedom hermione looked at the healer in shock she thought the healers supported the law himmilcook is a first class idiot the americans had reams of contradictory information along with literally hundreds of alternative suggestions i personally think minister fudge was simply trying to get himself a surge of popularity before the election as she talked the matronly healer was running her wand over hermione that idiot man should never have been allowed to step foot in the ministry much less run it she finished her diagnosis and stepped back well my dear you are doing quite well the baby is in fine health and you are as well although i would like to see a little bit more of a weight gain you haventbeen eating enough have you hermione flushed i er it been a stressful time healer interrupted snape smoothly i will make sure she gets better about her meals very good mr snape now do the two of you wish to know the gender of the child snape replied yes while hermione nodded the healer smiled at the response i see good you will be having a daughter hermione face lit up like the sun and severus found himself across the room with his arms wrapped around her he kissed the top of her head murmuring endearments she squeezed him tightly clinging to him like a starving lamprey madam brommel smiled indulgently at the couple thrilled to see such a happy result of the blasted marriage law it was so rare these days but every once in a while she saw a happy pair and was delighted she let the two revel in a news for a few minutes before clearing her throat they sprang apart guiltily now if i remember correctly you are a master of potions are you not mr snape he nodded good she needs to take this vitamin mixture once a day but these two need to be imbibed at every meal until she reaches a healthy weight madam pomfrey can easily determine that for you so i want you to have a follow up with her in a week she handed several colored vials to severus with a small pamphlet you can make the potions yourself but be sure to follow the instructions and ingredients precisely i know there are better and faster ways to do things but trust me when i say that these recipes have been developed like this for a reason severus nodded opening the pamphlet curiously i want to see you back here in one month hermione the baby is due in approximately six i am told poppy is interested in delivering her so i will come join you at hogwarts during the last week of your pregnancy unless it is necessary for me to come sooner snape head snapped up and he looked at her sharply what do you mean merely that her mother difficulty with her makes me want to be cautious she should be fine mr snape but it is better to be safe it occurred to him to wonder why this had not happened in his dream he nodded well that should be it then do either of you have any questions for me hermione nodded she decided to ask the healer something that had been bothering her for over some time now healer brommel yes mrs snape er you know that severus and i were married as a result of the marriage law i ve uh noticed that we donthave the need to er why are we no longer compelled to have sex three times a week interrupted snape catching on that is quite simple mr and mrs snape the marriage act was designed to encourage the production of children once pregnancy is achieved there is no longer a reason for the spell to activate to motivate sexual intercourse after the child is born you will no longer be subject to that part of the marriage law hermione felt like a bloody idiot if she had thought about it or if severus had there would not have been such an issue with her telling him about the baby she smiled it was better the way it happened however she would never forget the surprised and joyous look on her husband face when she told him thank you healer the matronly woman smiled comfortingly you are welcome my dear now donttake that to mean you are not encouraged to continue relations it helps a great deal in a marriage to have a physical relationship as well she patted hermione on the cheek and then indicated that she and her husband were free to leave i ll see you back here in four weeks severus offered his arm to his wife and the two left in silence each pondering the day revelations he found himself relieved that he would no longer be forced to couple with his wife but felt a pain at the thought of them having no physical relationship hopefully their recent activities were not just flukes brought on by ardor of the moment hermione was a passionate woman and it would not surprise him to find out that she simply needed release he hoped that was not the case the fact that she was living in his chambers and had been for two weeks now was a firm testament to things being more than impulsive the sex perhaps not as much but he felt fairly confident that she would soon be more comfortable with casual intimacy that was assuming of course she remained attracted to him hmm would now be a good time to ask her if she was still interested he thought she was her enthusiasm spoke loudly to the affirmative but still she was certainly being awfully quiet maybe she was rethinking her decision maybe she was regretting getting involved with him so soon bugger maybe she was still thinking about leaving the rest of the way to hogwarts was nerve wracking for them both they arrived back at the school and immediately went down to the dungeons without saying a word hermione stayed silent as she took her place on the couch and severus nervously busied himself with preparing tea while she fidgeted it did not take him long to boil the water and set up the tea tray a quick call to the kitchens produced a small plate of biscuits and in short order he was ensconced in his chair by the fire while she lounged on the settee the silence became unbearable after only a few minutes hermione severus he chuckled ladies first oh uh well i uh er well rarely was hermione so flustered it was all severus could do not to laugh at his furiously blushing bride spit it out love er uh about what madam brommel said yes was she going to say what he hoped will uh if you uh well i wecanstillhavesexifyouwantto she finished in a rush what was that my dear i uh i she stood up determinedly oh bugger it with a few purposeful strides she was next to him leading over to capture his lips in a searing kiss he felt her fingers grip the top of his shirt and suddenly he was yanked in the direction of the bedroom by his suddenly assertive wife he could get used to this hermione frantically attacked his buttons all the while kissing his lips neck and chest paying careful attention to the sensitive spot right underneath his ear he made no attempt to hide his growl as she latched on to his ear and nibbled he quickly returned the favor his fingers were busily at work divesting her of all clothing and stroking every inch of her as their passions rose they got more frantic until they came together in a burst of sensation and emotion it was the most incredible thing either of them ever experienced hours later severus woke up with his wife curled against him and he allowed himself to smile happy that they had broken through what he hoped was the final barrier in their relationship he gently kissed her temple causing her to sigh contentedly and then pulled her closer before losing himself in sleep okay guys here it is the next installment hopefully it hasntbeen so long that you ve forgotten our story thus far i apologize for the wait but as you ve noticed i sure reality is so much more demanding than fanfiction enjoy the show hermione finished her letter with a flourish and handed it to her husband for his approval his dark eyes raked over the page as his wife watched in pensive anticipation with an almost imperceptible shift he turned is gaze to observe the bushy haired witch as she chewed nervously on her bottom lip the urge to do some nibbling himself struck him but he pushed it aside for later now was not the time to indulge his lustful desires well she asked impatiently severus smirked well what severus salazar snape calm yourself my dear he gave her a quick peck on the lips the letter is fine i sure the minister will be quite impressed before he tosses it into the fire she huffed in exasperation if only they d hold the bloody elections then we could get a real minister in charge i bet things would start changing then that is assuming love that the man in charge had any interest in changing things hermione gaped at him what do you mean and what do you mean the man in charge a woman is just as capa again he kissed her into silence yes he murmured i agree unfortunately there are far too many witches and wizards who are not used to the idea of an independent woman why do you think there was so little protest over the marriage law hermione severus thought the scowl on her face was adorable yes well things have to change sometime and perhaps now is the time for that change to begin love but it will take years before women are accepted as an equal part of our society you are fortunate that you have the opportunities you do only the woman who helped defeat voldemort could have such options his wife face grew somber am i doing the right thing then what do you mean i mean taking a teaching position at hogwarts if i have such opportunity more opportunities than other witches then maybe you could be as unhappy as them he took her hands darling look at me do whatever it is that makes you happy if you wish to teach then teach no one will think less of you for it the mere fact that you will soon be a potions mistress in your own right is accomplishment enough for most lifetimes there are only two other female masters of potions in the world soon there will be three trust me hermione no one will think you have cast aside your wealth of opportunities for the easy road he smirked you are after all married to me hermione laughed and pulled her husband closer that is very true my love she murmured in his ear her breath sending chills through his body you can be very difficult her tongue flicked out to brush his ear but oh so worth it severus seized his wife by her waist and wrapped his arms around her his lips found hers and they began a duel of tongues which quickly turned into a furiously passionate kiss he had just braced himself to pick her up when he heard a throat clear albus hermione pulled herself away and straightened her clothes her face flushed with embarrassment and desire severus hermione i do hope i was not interrupting not yet muttered snape er no of course not albus what can we do for you albus gave her an amused look and then stepped aside you can help me take care of this severus barely had time to brace himself as he was pounced upon by a large black shape the animal pinned him to the floor and then began licking his face enthusiastically his wife laughter only added insult to an already embarrassing situation albus i thought you were going to release the panther into the dark forest the headmaster eyes twinkled madly i did my boy but it appears the panther has taken a shine to you he sat outside the gates all night perhaps a side effect of the potion oof no albus i checked that yesterday there is nothing in the potion that induces any feelings of friendship or otherwise it is merely based on several potions combined together including a love potion stated the older wizard which interact in such a way as to provide life saving healing to whomever drinks it finished snape i dontthink that hermione interrupted severus what if he right the potions master scowled at his wife seriously she continued what if a side effect of the potion is that the person drinking it falls in love with the one that gave it to them i dontsee how he trailed off as a possibility occurred to him hermione did we use rose root in the potion base yes we oh you think we should have used lily root it has the same properties without activating the devotion properties of the love potion which is why lily root is used in confidence potions i bet that would work severus ignored the headmaster as he rushed into the lab and pulled out the base ingredients for the all heal potion it will take us several days to find out if it works but i dontsee why it won t he said albus could you please arrange for another test subject of course my boy but what about your first one he seems rather devoted the dark haired wizard frowned in irritation the potion will wear off in a few days he can stay here until then but i reserve the right to stun him if he gets too disruptive albus nodded knowing refusal would be futile in truth he honestly doubted the love potion reaction was strong enough to account for the panther total devotion but he knew severus would have to figure that out for himself mentally he smiled it appeared his former potions mater finally found himself a familiar excellent the elderly wizard left the lab in a whirl of brightly colored robes curious as to how things were going to turn out this time perhaps he should get another panther white this time for hermione several days later the lab was prepared for another test only this time the potion would be administered by hermione she insisted that severus had enough to deal with since the black panther still refused to leave albus agreed with her but acceded to severus demand to be in the room to protect his wife if necessary hermione was not terribly worried but it was nice to see such concern for her welfare hermione entered the testing chamber with her husband who immediately stopped and stared at disbelief at their subject it was all she could do not to laugh at the look on his face the test subject in question was an ivory furred panther covered in angry red slash and burn marks it made her skin crawl to see the stark contrast between the red and the white severus was giving her a concerned look to which she responded with a weak smile what was the headmaster thinking the man in question entered the room in a flourish his garish blue and green robes flowing behind him he beamed at the pair and then gave them a look that could only be described as imploring severus who was used to the headmaster childish idiosyncrasies stepped forward albus he reached out and clasped the old wizard hand your contribution to our research is greatly appreciated the headmaster beamed you re welcome my boy it was my pleasure i had a bit of a time finding this poor beast however it is not easy to locate white panthers in normal condition severely injured was far more difficult er your efforts were more than sufficient albus he eyed his wife significantly she nodded her head in agreement yes we really appreciate your help albus he perfect she my dear i afraid i could only find a female panther hermione rolled her eyes of course albus could only find a female why the great cat had to be white she doubted she would ever know but she supposed it was some sort of odd matchmaking symmetry thing on his part sometimes the headmaster was a bit dotty severus tugged on her hand and gently pulled her to the center of the room are you ready for this love she nodded bracing herself for the reality of a dying creature i will remove the stasis field all you need to do is pour the potion down her throat but be sure to step back as soon as you re finished i dontwant you getting hurt hermione nodded dutifully i will severus dontworry i ll be fine she smiled rubbing her belly and so will she the test itself was almost anticlimactic the stasis field disappeared with a wave of her husband wand she stepped forward and carefully gripped the panther jaw with one hand pouring the potion with the other the weakly struggling creature gulped down the potion almost as if she knew it was what she needed and suddenly was surrounded by the brilliant golden glow of magic hermione moved back to stand near albus as her husband watched and catalogued the panther reactions the white fur enabled them see what was happening a lot better than with the first subject severus took meticulous notes on the speed at which the slashes closed and the burns healed he noted the effectiveness of the potion seemed to remain strong from start to finish but that the subject seemed tired after the healing perhaps the healing energy was drawn partially from the panther for her part hermione was fascinated by the process pleased at their ability to observe the potion effects clearly perhaps the old wizard was not as dotty as she suspected once the golden glow faded severus cast a restraining spell on the giant cat and the three wizards left the full healing process in actuality took several days but the immediate effect brought the creature back from death door it appeared however that the new ingredient made very little difference to the effectiveness of the potion several days later it was confirmed that the alteration to the all heal potion made no difference in how the potion worked nor did it apparently make a difference in the resulting behaviour of the animal unfortunately it appeared that hermione too found herself a new familiar after much deliberation severus was forced to admit he had no explanation for the panthers conduct albus explanation did not sit well with him but there really was not another one perhaps you have secured their loyalty by saving their lives severus observed the headmaster it is well documented that animals have a very positive response to those who rescue them from death why would this be any different usually the person in question spends enormous amounts of time earning the animal trust albus you expect me to believe such trust can occur in an instant the elderly wizard wiggled his fingers eyes twinkling mischievously magic severus i suspect everything in this situation can be explained by the usage of magic hermione giggled prompting a scowl from her husband well then we need to find a way to dispel it now severus now nothing albus i am not going to have some giant cat lurking around getting into things and generally being a nuisance severus snape osiris and isis are anything but a nuisance severus rolled his eyes his wife was far too obsessed with mythology you know very well that osiris is just as sneaky as you are and that he has a knack for finding students out after curfew you mentioned it yourself the other day you said he had proven himself to be quite useful hermione hermione nothing i am not going to cast isis aside because you cantdeal with the idea of having a familiar you know she ll be miserable without him severus began to weaken but what about our daughter love dontyou want to keep her safe she glared low blow severus and yes i do i dontthink either of them is a threat both of them have been nothing but gentle to the kids even when the first years were chasing them yesterday if it makes you feel better however we can bind them so they can do no harm he shook his head no i dont want to leave them defenseless he sighed i suppose this means we need to make some changes to our quarters the joy in his wife eyes and her squeal of joy made severus defeat at her hands worth it she flung herself into his arms and silently thanked him he knew she had been wanting a familiar since the death of her beloved crookshanks but had not found a suitable replacement until the ivory panther mentally he smirked leave it to hermione to move up the scale from a half kneezle to a full panther at least she was used to working with dangerous animals it did not take long to alter the snapes quarters to accommodate the pair of panthers hermione insisted they be allowed to leave the castle whenever they wanted so he and albus spent several days designing a safe method for them to do so utilizing hermione model of a muggle device called a dog door they were able to create a magical passage that would only allow the panthers access to the castle severus heaped every defense he could remember on the door and then placed the panthers room immediately nearby hermione used dobby and her own magic to create a fantastical environ for the pair to stay in and was ecstatic when the two great cats appeared to appreciate her efforts things settled down after that allowing severus and his wife time to get to know each other better and work on repairing the damage three years of indifference caused to both of them hermione began plotting a fantastical evening for her husband feeling that the time had finally come for her to step up and take the risk in furthering their relationship she had no idea severus was thinking the same thing severus flicked his hand moving the last candle into place his gaze swept over the room and he felt his lips curve into a pleased smile hermione was going to love this it was shortly more than a month after her visit to st mungo and everything had been going extremely well they were settled into a comfortable routine he still taught the little buggers known as students she helped him with his classes as an assignment from her master albus dumbledore earlier today she had been grading papers and doing quite well with the snide commentary he had to admit and was currently helping him replenish the school supply of medicinal potions the quidditch finals were approaching and there were usually more accidents as a result of the severe competition severus sent hermione off to the apothecary to pick up an order of ingredients for the next batch of healing potions he could have had it delivered but he needed her out of the castle so he could prepare his surprise draco told him it was very important to surprise women on occasion it helped keep them off balance and usually resulted in incredible gratitude that translated into immediate and rather passionate action not that he needed to manipulate his wife that way but if it helped improve her disposition no true slytherin would ignore such a powerful tool casting a critical eye over his preparations severus went over the checklist in his head floating candles check romantic table setting for two check a bouquet of her favorite flowers check the arrangements for dinner were already made with the house elves and dumbledore knew not to disturb him for anything less than the return of the dark lord mr montrey had been informed that slytherin house was on its own for the night and sinistra was filling in as head of house he glanced down at his new clothes hoping he did not look like an idiot draco had suggested a change of attire and the boy wife was cheeky enough to give him some advice thanks to them he was standing in his chambers feeling naked the loose fitting black slacks were very comfortable but he was not used to wearing a high collared shirt without an overcoat and robes the black silk suited him however and he was pleased with the silver buttons each was adorned with a tiny carved snake the clothes showed off his lithe form well but he still felt as if something was missing a small twinge in the back of his mind alerted him to his wife imminent return and with a final visual sweep of the rooms he disappeared into a secret passage hermione was tired and frustrated as she stomped back to the castle she swore this was the last time she fetched one of severus damned orders for ingredients why had he wanted her to go get them the apothecary delivered this had to be some way to get her out of his hair she thought bastard why had he not just asked her to make herself scarce or something she could go visit harry or ginny and draco or the weasleys merlin knew she had plenty of places to go she sighed maybe he was afraid she would take it as a rejection yes that was probably it they needed to have a chat about that he was still walking on eggshells fearful that she was going to leave and take their daughter with her she could see his perspective but hoped she had been giving him plenty of signals that she intended to stay she just had not told him yet bugger it looked like she was not going to be able to wait to inform him of her decision until her surprise was ready maybe they needed to talk tonight in all honesty she probably would not be so annoyed if she had not run into that mega bitch pansy parkinson in town severus had no way of knowing how many of the pure blood witches and wizards formerly attached to death eater families treated her and he would never find out if she had her way let him relax and think that things were better they were not bad there was just a lot of progress to be made and the bloody marriage law had set it back years stupid fudge fortunately it was looking like he was no longer going to be minister hermione made her way to the potions laboratory where she carefully catalogued and stored the ingredients for use tomorrow there was a quidditch match in two days and they really needed to get those potions brewed for madam pomfrey it was odd that severus was not in the lab but she supposed he was taking a break from their almost constant brewing she smirked maybe he was in their chambers reading already feeling better at the thought of seeing her husband the tired brunette continued on to their quarters thinking about what she was going to do when she saw him she never expected the sight that greeted her white candles floated around the room bathing everything in a soft golden glow a beautiful gown deep green with gold accents floated midair with a letter pinned to the bodice she noticed a pair of matching shoes nearby and a jewelry case she saw a small table with two chairs near the fire set with the snape family china and heavy silver flatware crystal wineglasses and a beautiful bouquet of flowers completed the arrangement she picked up the note dearest hermione i devoutly hope you will do me the honor of joining me for a romantic dinner this evening followed by dancing at the starlight dance house i have arranged for your favorite meal to be delivered as soon as you are ready once you have dressed for dinner you can find me in my study where i breathlessly await your arrival love always severus hermione was stunned admittedly severus had proven himself a closet romantic in many ways but something like this out of the blue and totally unexpected was amazing she smiled brilliantly at his thoughtfulness thinking that this would be the perfect night to tell him that she wanted to stay severus watched as his wife examined the dress and then turned to gaze around her in wonder he could not help the smirk that graced his lips being the head of slytherin house for the past two decades truly had paid off for years he had been breaking up romantic rendezvous and trysts between his students and every time he took careful note of what the boy did to get the girl attention mark one up for snape he thought his stunned wife carefully took the dress out of the air and headed to the bathroom it seemed like an eternity before she exited the room exquisite in the beautiful green ballgown she may be the embodiment of her house he thought but the green did truly suit her hermione hair was pulled up into a loose collection of curls atop her head wisps of hair framed her face in a halo of bronze and a light coating of makeup accented her features making them all the more beautiful his heart leapt at the sight causing a driving urge to rush over a take her crimson lips with his truly he was the most fortunate of men hermione quickly slipped on the bejeweled emerald shoes her husband had left with the dress eyeing the jewelry box with trepidation she opened it and gasped at the sight several years ago severus had mentioned his mother jewelry to her and had shown her a piece of it never in her life could she have imagined something that gaudy could exist she never asked her husband about the jewelry again relieved he did not force her to wear it at the few social events he could not talk his way out of the sparkling ornaments before her shone with antiquity but were far more exquisite than anything she had ever seen a set of diamond and emerald jewelry set in platinum lay in the box nestled on a velvet bed of verdant green there was a pair of earrings large but tasteful and the bracelet was a double strand of diamond and emerald bangles it was the necklace however that drew her attention sparkling diamonds were interspersed with pea sized forest green emeralds hanging from a heavy chain of platinum the two strands were joined at the base of the neck with a large emerald the size of a knut from which dangled a row of smaller emeralds hands shaking hermione gently lifted the necklace out of the box and reached back only to encounter the hands of her husband he gently plucked the clasp from her fingers and proceeded to fasten it around her neck let me he murmured his deep velvety voice sending chills through her body once the necklace was secure he laid a gentle kiss on the back of her neck prompting another shiver and then reached over to pick up the bracelet you look beautiful hermione he said while fastening the shining ornament around her wrist truly a vision of loveliness he continued picking up an earring i hope you understand how much you mean to me love all this he said gesturing to the clothing and jewelry is merely a token of my feelings for you i love you her heart melted at his words and she became even more positive that the decision she made earlier this week was the correct one sure she could love harry or find someone else but they would not be severus he was who she wanted to be with he was the man she wanted to father her children he held her heart she stepped forward and twinned her arms around his neck i love you too severus she breathed you are everything i could imagine wanting and more i her monologue was interrupted as her husband lips crashed into hers he pulled her to him his arms wrapped around her tightly and allowed his passionate kiss to speak of his love commitment and desire for his wife it idly occurred to him that they were never going to get to the dancing part at this rate but the rest of his mind did not care she was here in his arms and he would never let her go if he had his way the two kissed for some time severus was careful not to muss hermione too badly and she restrained herself from untying his hair and running her fingers through it when they pulled away by mutual choice both were giddy and breathless lips puffy and cheeks flushed from the kisses severus cleared his throat dinner my lady he gave her a slight bow and held out his hand she smiled and returned his bow with a curtsey gladly taking his hand it would be my pleasure my lord the house elves were summoned and dinner was served time passed in a pleasant manner as they dined keeping the conversation light by mutual consent i cantbelieve miss gyrford actually thought the drivel she turned in would be up to anyone standards the least of all yours what was she thinking i believe that is the point my dear miss gyrford is taking potions simply because it is expected of her she plans to find herself a wealthy man marry him and settle down into a life of luxurious indolence hermione gazed at her husband incredulously how can she think that doesntshe have any self respect hermione love are you more surprised that she has those desires or that she is a gryffindor and has no ambition beyond a convenient marriage well i er she sputtered it not that severus it just gryffindors are typically characterized by nobility and self sacrifice are they not she nodded just like slytherins are said to possess great cunning and ambition what makes you think these traits are mutually exclusive it seems to me that miss gyrford has a certain amount of nobility she has taken care of the younger students over the years and will probably be a very good wife but she also has the ambition to be a woman who will be given everything she could possibly want by an adoring husband but i believe my dear that the sheer stubbornness and bravery of chasing after such a dream is what placed her in your house instead of mine a slytherin girl would be far more subtle i guess i can see that he reached out and dropped a kiss into her palm now how are things going with albus her eyes lit up with excitement he says i doing very well as a matter of fact he said he was going to talk with you about letting me help you brew a batch of wolfsbane for st mungo s severus chuckled he has said nothing as of yet but i see no reason to turn down your aid you are more than capable of assisting with such a task his wife face glowed at his expression of approval i was planning to start after we finished restocking the infirmary if that is fine for your schedule hermione grinned mischievously i think i might be able to fit it in somewhere he deliberately dropped his voice to a silky whisper i certainly hope so the clank of his wife dropping her fork echoed through his chambers er she blushed furiously feeling benevolent severus stood and held out a hand to his embarrassed wife shall we move on to the next part of our evening my love she clutched at his hand relieved to have the conversation diverted elsewhere i i d love to dancing did you say did i severus come my dear your carriage awaits and indeed it did severus had arranged for a beautiful carriage to wait for them at the gates of hogwarts it was white with silver scrollwork accents and was manned by an elderly wizard in the driving seat and a handsome youth as a footman the young man opened the door and pulled down the step as they approached but made sure to move away when severus made it clear his help was not needed hermione was quickly ensconced on the luxuriously padded bench with a helping hand from her husband and the rustle of her satiny dress the dark man joined her shortly thereafter and they were soon on their way into town the stars in hermione eyes as she gazed about her in wonder made every moment of his efforts worth it they sat in silence for the short trip gazing at each other with boundless love hands joined between them his wife natural curiosity asserted itself when the noise of the carriage indicated they were on cobblestone and she turned her eyes away to look at the passing buildings she thought deeply as she watched wondering when it would be appropriate for her to tell severus of her decision her attention was diverted when she realized they were in a part of hogsmeade she had never been in before and she pushed her deliberations aside for another time perhaps she could tell him tomorrow after they woke up this was his night and she wanted nothing more than to show him how much he appreciated his efforts the carriage rolled to a stop in front of a plain wooden building with a single set of oak french doors between two flickering torches severus stepped out of the carriage and helped his wife down the small step offering her his arm after she exited the carriage she took it and they headed toward the building for the next event of the evening an inclined head toward the footman and driver acknowledged their help and the carriage left presumably to pick up another passenger what is this place severus he opened the door and motioned for her to enter you tell me my dear hermione gasped at the interiour of the building small round tables dotted the edges of the large open room and were crowded with dozens of people laughing drinking and apparently having a good time people were also crowded into the center of the room where a wide silvery circle of smooth floor served as an area to dance glancing overhead hermione could see an illusion of the starlit sky with a full moon lighting the room the host greeted severus by name and motioned to a table in the corner welcome to the starlight master snape please your table is over there thanking him the potions master led his wife over to the table took her cloak and pulled her chair out for her she gave him a grateful smile as she sat and the two quickly put in their drink orders with the waiter what do you think my dearest hermione eyes sparkled it beautiful severus thank you i he stood up would you do me the honor of this dance my darling she nodded and severus to her hand and guided her to the dance floor the music was slow which made the dance simple and both of them spent the time enjoying the moment wrapped in their love their lips met for a short gentle kiss as the song ended leaving hermione almost boneless in her husband embrace severus took a great deal of pleasure out of surprising her for the next dance hemrione was startled to find that her husband was an accomplished dancer knowing apparently many forms including the waltz two step foxtrot and the tango the evening passed in a whirl of dancing and even severus had to admit he enjoyed himself the carriage was waiting for them when it was time to head back and they rode together in silence his arms wrapped around her thank you she said her voice muffled by his coat anything for you my darling hermione pulled away to look her husband in the eyes any woman would be fortunate to be with him she thought but far too many of them would never give him the chance for three years she gave him that chance and now that he had taken the opportunity she offered she found that he was perfect in almost every way now was the time for her to tell him she wanted to stay with him that she wanted to be the mother of his children and his companion for the rest of her life never mind those other petty minded bitches severus was hers and that was all that mattered severus it pained her to see his defenses go up and his eyes shutter this was a man who had spent far too much of his life being hurt her hand stroked his cheek severus it okay don t donthide from me please he touched his lips to hers hermione love i something in her eyes caught his attention and he found himself being drawn into her thoughts he dared not hope she was about to tell him what he had prayed for every night for the past month instinctively he reached for it only to be drawn in by a recent and very powerful memory hey granger hermione turned to eye the former slytherin distastefully i believe that would be mrs snape to you pansy the blond haired girl laughed mockingly that a good one i ll have to remember that the thought that a mudblood like you deserves to be addressed by such an ancient and noble name is beyond ridiculous you re very amusing granger i ll give you that what do you want pansy pansy cornflower blue eyes turned innocent whatever do you mean mrs snape i was simply offering a polite greeting surely even one such as yourself can recognize it as such hermione smiled sweetly i sorry pansy darling but i afraid my upbringing taught me a very different definition of polite i suspect you would not understand however since it means you would need to comprehend the ideal of basic human kindness her brown eyes were hard that must be incredibly difficult for a person of your limited capabilities an angry flush tinted the pig like features of the other girl at least i am capable of comprehending when i not wanted granger even one of my limited capabilities would be able to see that your own husband wants nothing to do with you severus felt her twinge of pain at that i see you re out all by your lonesome again did your husband find something better to do with his time like watch the house elves clean she smirked tell me how does it feel to be so undesirable that someone like snape doesnteven want you hermione kept her face neutral but in truth the other witch words hurt her more than she would ever admit her head remained proud and her features haughty i not sure pansy how does it feel to be so pathetic that you need to pick on a lousy mudblood you bitch pansy reached for her wand go ahead parkinson make my christmas hermione purred her hand near her wand i ve been wanting to hex you for years it was obvious her former classmate had never truly thought about what it would be like to cross hermione granger severus could see the thoughts flicker behind the pug faced girl watery blue eyes as she contemplated the consequences of her actions hermione graduated at the top of her class and despite all the rumours that her potions grades at least had been influenced by her relationship with the professor pansy knew she was no match for the former gryffindor in any situation the slytherin girl wondered if the stories about her temper were true pansy shrugged indifferently go ahead i not really concerned granger everyone knows why you got such good grades the insinuation was not difficult to understand snape was almost impressed by the girl bravado who would have thought parkinson had such enormous rocks he watched while his wife weighed the benefits and consequences of hexing the ruddy bint and came to the conclusion that she should take the high ground and just walk away the problem was that she was getting sick of it insinuate all you want parkinson she hissed what you say will never change the truth nor will it change the fact that you graduated near the bottom of our class despite your extracurricular activities if there was someone here who tried to earn good grades on her back it would most certainly not be me hermione pretended to think come to think of it why did you do so abysmally is it because you were able to provide the quantity but not the quality pansy gasped this was far too enjoyable she smirked i guess that the difference between being the school cleansweep and a firebolt with a snarl of uncontrolled fury pansy pulled her wand on the grinning brunette before she could even think of a curse hermione disarmed her with a gesture and then summoned the girl wand she was tempted to mock her further but now was not the time to start hacking off the daughter of a so called former death eater how that bastard got off she never knew but severus had speculated he possessed some sort of blackmail material on fudge in addition to a huge bribe now pansy surely we can settle this like civilized adults i ll go on my merry way and you can continue with whomever oh i mean whatever you were doing pansy eyes burned bright with hatred give me my wand granger feigning a look of surprise hermione held out the wand but not before she whispered a short incantation oh dear me i sorry pansy i totally forgot here you are she tossed a brilliant smile at the infuriated woman do be careful with it pansy i would hate for something permanent to happen to it with a toss of her chestnut mane of curls hermione continued on her way smirking as she heard muttered swearing behind her good now the buggering chit would not be able to bother her for at least a week severus eyed his wife incredulously did she have any idea what she had done wha how you he struggled to articulate the horror he felt at her inordinate stupidity how the bloody hell could you do that he snarled do you have any idea how foolish that was you stupid little girl severus snape how dare you call me that i how dare you risk your life and the life of our child in that manner he hissed thanks to your stupidity the likelihood that you and our daughter will die has been increased a thousand fold hermione looked at him as if she had been struck i the anger drained out of him at the fearful expression on her face he pulled her into his arms i apologize love i was simply fearful for you i losing you would devastate me hermione i love you and the thought that that ruddy bitch will be lusting for your blood and no doubt bringing her father into it disturbs me more than i can express he pulled away to look at her if there was a way to insult her on any more levels love i am hard pressed to think of it in one conversation you insulted her appearance intelligence and desirability all while calling her a slut and disabling her wand he thought her smirk was wildly inappropriate and narrowed his eyes into a glare oh stop it severus i know it was foolish i guess i was just tired of always having to be the one to take it you know they ve been mocking me for three years about our marriage and for seven years before that on anything dealing with school or my lineage i just reached a breaking point her earnest eyes met his you cantexpect me to always lie down and take it darling just because i happen to be one of the good guys i didntfight voldemort just so that some ugly pug faced bitch treat me like rubbish three years after that bastard death severus reached out and gently touched her cheek i know love i dontwant you to have to live like that i wish i had known earlier that she was treating you this way why didntyou tell me hermione shook her head smiling wryly it not just her severus it almost everyone who had any association with voldemort or his lackeys there nothing you could have done about it you d be surprised he stated bleakly her lips curved into a fond smile you cantfight the world love once again hermione found herself wrapped in her husband tight embrace i can try my darling for you i would try anything hermione was silent for a time content to enjoy the rest of the carriage ride in the arms of her husband he refused to allow anything to interfere with his plans for the rest of the evening so when they arrived back at hogwarts he escorted her back to their chambers and proceeded to initiate the rest of the evening festivities hermione revelation was quickly forgotten the next day severus received an owl from st mungo inviting him to demonstrate his all heal potion two weeks hence his wife was sitting at his desk grading papers with relish it never ceased to amaze him how enthusiastic she was about everything but especially he liked the fact that she could match him for snarkiness and had no problems demonstrating that fact to the students when she graded their essays she insisted upon grading at his desk because it helped channel her inner snape the tall wizard silently glided behind her knowing she would not notice his presence until he caught her attention he cleared his throat good afternoon severus she said absently slashing another swath of red across the page i ll be done in a minute he kissed the nape of her neck good afternoon love i see you have managed to wade your way through mr oberlin abysmal attempt at an essay she snorted an exercise in bad grammer without even token homage to spelling you mean i didnt even know there was such a thing as an asswinder edge does he even stay awake in your classes severus smirked you ll be finding that out soon enough my dear albus informed me that you will be taking over my third and fifth year classes starting next term mr oberlin i believe will be moving into his fifth year assuming he passes the year of course of course she murmured i certainly hope albus doesntexpect me to teach him to spell hermione love i daresay even albus dumbledore would give up when faced with the terror that is edward oberlin grammatical and spelling talent the brown haired woman laughed as she put a final mark on the young man paper standing up she stretched out her back careful to rub up against her husband chest as she did so with a growl he grabbed her and whirled her around capturing her lips in a passionate kiss minutes later they parted breathless and wishing albus did not require them to take lunch in the great hall severus dark eyes smoldered as he regarded his wife until later my darling she ran her finger up his chest and brushed the back of his neck in response definitely hermione took her husband arm and they headed out to lunch on the way there he remembered to tell her about the owl hermione yes severus tell me have you made any plans for two weeks from today hermione thought for a moment and then shook her head no i dontthink so why because i was thinking we might take a bit of a trip to st mungo s he could tell his wife was confused by the dramatic pause at the end ooookay uh i sure we can er plan that i glad to hear that he replied silkily i would hate to have to present my potion to st mungo without my beautiful wife and assistant there to see it it took a moment to sink in several students were startled by the squeal of joy that came from the potions professor wife and the sight of her leaping into his arms they stared at the dark wizard in awe seeing for the first time the devotion and love his wife had for him he was surprised to find himself preening at the impressed looks meanwhile hermione was kissing his face alternating words of congratulations with a quick peck on his lips or cheek severus quickly became wrapped up in her and lost track of any reality but that of his wife it was not until albus dumbledore cleared his throat that the two of them came back from their own personal loving universe hermione hopped down and looked at her master contritely er headmaster i can explain began snape albus held up his hand no need severus i trust you have good news to share with us uh yes i uh now that he was no longer intent on hermione severus became aware of the students regard st mungo s er st mungo wants to see the all heal potion albus isntthat wonderful hermione grabbed her husband arm and wormed her way underneath it so he was holding her close he certainly did not mind albus beamed congratulations severus this i think calls for some celebration dobby yes what can dobby do for headmaster we re having a bit of a party dobby punch and sweets for everyone the students cheered as the great hall suddenly sprouted decorations and small round tables of food and punch sprung up in place of the house tables severus rolled his eyes any excuse for a party he thought and then settled down to endure the festivities it was going to be a long two weeks thank you to everyone who is continuing to read this fic despite my incredible lack of regular updates there should be only one chapter to go so finally this fic will come to an end i am hoping to post another in full not too long after this it may not be until the holiday however since i donthave the time to work on writing very often anymore damn my increasing responsibilities at work thanks to jkr for letting me play in her world hermione snape sat in the library pouring over the latest issue of ars alchemica her hand absently rubbed the small mound of her belly as she read the feature article brow furrowing at some of the concepts hinkleson defiantly is an idiot she muttered why do they let that man publish his cousin owns the magazine replied ginny malfoy the grinning former weasley sauntered into the room and dropped gracefully into one of the chairs hey mione how it going hermione snorted it would be a lot better if the bloody idiots at ars alchemica stop publishing rubbish labeled as cutting edge research listen to this kneezle hair has been proven to be the only ingredient capable of increasing the affect of a potion tenfold while not interfering with its function as such a healing potion made with kneezle hair would increase the power of the potion to the point that it will cure anything including a death wound she began to pace agitatedly that hack he stole the idea off severus at a convention two years ago i cantbelieve the audacity not a week left until severus is going to unveil his potion and the bloody bastard is shooting his mouth off in a magazine no doubt hoping that he will get some credit for severus hard work ginny rolled her eyes geez hermione chill it not like anyone is going to believe your husband stole the buggering idiot research severus may be disliked by most of the wizarding world but even those who hate him have to admit he a bloody brilliant bastard thank you for your vote of confidence mrs malfoy severus snape dark form stepped out of the shadows and glided up to his wife she relaxed into him as he wrapped his strong arms around her it all right darling all my research has been duly filed and notarized with the goblins before i ever mentioned the potion to anyone she looked surprised the goblins surely a know it all such as yourself is aware that the goblins take care of far more than just the gold in gringott s his eyebrow arched at her negative response they are well known for their neutrality hence they are the trusted parties when one might wish to secure something without worrying about corruption the goblins have no interest in politics severus smirked at the delighted smile on his wife face he always loved to see her learn something new especially if he was the one teaching it to her i didntknow that her sparkling brown eyes met his thank you severus he kissed her gently my pleasure hermione pulling himself away reluctantly severus brought himself back to the present and the reason he came in search of his wife hermione my dear it seems that i need to make a trip to st mungo to make sure they have the appropriate facilities and equipment for our demonstration i thought you might wish to accompany me hermione shook her head ginny and i are going shopping today if you dontmind that is he chuckled not at all my dear i imagine you will have a far better time shopping with mrs malfoy that dealing with hospital administrators he kissed her hand would dinner be remiss no not at all er i think ginny smirked dontworry mione i told draco i d be back before dinner she looked at severus i ll have her back in time professor well then until tonight my darling severus kissed his wife lingeringly before striding away in a whirl of black hermione stood still for a few moments still caught up in the emotions surging through her ginny cleared her throat heh hem earth to hermione are you still with me the dreamy smile on her friend face answered that question far louder than words she began to come out of it er what are we still going shopping or are you going to stand there contemplating the door all day hermione started oh sorry i er ginny interrupted i know i know i ve seen that look before she laughed at her friend blush i probably wore it every time i saw draco for the first year of our marriage the starry eyed witch chuckled and then stood to stretch out her back it occurred to her that she should probably make some attempt at training herself to good posture someday but that corner chair of madam prince is far too comfortable a flick of her wand returned the books to their proper locations and moments later she gazed at her friend expectantly shall we with a delighted laugh ginny grabbed hermione hand and dragged her from the library it was not long before they were on the road to hogsmeade so how are things going with the great dark wizard of hogwarts hermione laughed things are going fine with severus ginny why do you ask i your friend you dolt i just wanted to make sure there have been no more relapses into hostility or any return toward the indifferent state of your marriage from before no actually things have been going quite well ginny gave her an inscrutable look i ll freely admit that things will never be boring we re both far too prickly for that but we ve learned to work out our problems instead of avoiding them or ignoring the situation that good draco and i were worried for a while there me too it was a bit rocky at the beginning for three years the brown haired witch tossed a mock glare at her friend before chuckling ruefully maybe but lately he been wonderful he is so thrilled about the baby too you should see our rooms he bought tons of books on how to be a good parent and we ve been working together to prepare a nursery for our daughter her eyes sparkled as she spoke he brought this beautiful crib from snape manor and has been helping me decorate i bet that was interesting hermione snorted interesting would not be the term i would have used i think unmitigated disaster would be far more accurate ginny gave her a surprised look what happened severus got far too immersed in the entire slytherin versus gryffindor thing again he wanted the room to be green decorated with snakes and little silver cauldrons and you wanted red and gold with lions actually no i wanted it to be a nice neutral color maybe a nice sapphire blue with white and navy accents i saw this lovely wallpaper at matron maternity with little books and quills on a blue background there was a set of navy bedclothes embroidered with tiny gold quills that would have been perfect i notice you say would have been remarked ginny severus was hell bent on using the bedclothes from the manor green and silver with snakes of course and decided to decorate without me uh oh yeah i was not amused we got into a fight but the end result besides the mind blowing sex was a compromise merlin knows severus has enough money to spend on this so he commissioned madam matron to alter the wallpaper to a greenish blue and we will be using a combination of the navy bedclothes i liked and the ones from the snape family home ginny regarded her friend curiously when did this take place harry didntmention a fight between the two of you it was a few days after the last test of severus healing potion he wanted to get everything arranged before we go to st mungo just in case they might want to see the potion brewed in person or we may just start teaching people immediately with the baby due in four months you may not have time to spend on decorating the nursery before the baby born observed ginny shrewdly exactly he really does think of everything hermione said with pride ginny gave her a quick hug thrilled to see her friend was finally happy in her marriage with the man she loved for years she had feared hermione would never find happiness especially ever since she figured out that she was in love with the potions master fortunately the dark man apparently came to the realization of what a royal berk he was being and went to extraordinary lengths to fix things the sparkle of happiness in hermione eyes spoke louder than words of his success hmmm what about her did she make her decision yet ginny turned to the brilliant witch currently absorbed in looking at a miniature set of witch robes mione yes ginny hermione asked absently trying to decide if she should purchase the robes the dark blue color would match the baby room perfectly and the lack of green and scarlet would prevent another house rivalry er did you ever make a decision about whether or not you re staying here hermione turned to regard the younger witch in surprise i mean you seem so happy with him but you have yet to say whether or not you will be staying hermione flushed uh yes ginny i have decided she paused for a moment as if it was difficult for her to say yes i staying you dontseem so sure about that shaking her head in protest the bushy haired woman objected no ginny that not it not what you think i know i want to stay with severus i just her eyes filled with conflicted emotions there still fear you know i mean i know he loves me and i know he will love our daughter but you re afraid things will go back to the way they were once she is born ginny stated yes i i dontwant to think that way but three years of that kind of treatment on the tail end of seven hellish years of school is difficult to get over ginny scrutinized her friend but you want to believe of course i do ginny i want it to be sincere i want severus to be the man he has been during the past few months despite the fights and the disagreements he still a wonderful man whom i love dearly but but it not about me anymore can i risk my daughter happiness on the uncertainties of her father moods the younger girl took a moment to consider the situation she looked at hermione i think you can the upset witch blinked at her in surprise hermione severus knows more than any of us what it like to grow up with an indifferent and hateful father he may not be the nicest man in the world but he not going to subject his child to the same things he suffered growing up i mean do you honestly think he ll treat her badly hermione sighed no ginny i don t that why i going to stay even though i have some fear i love him dearly and i believe he will be a wonderful father then what however continued hermione holding up her hand to fend off interruptions just because i have faith in his ability to perform well as a father does not mean i can convince that frightened part of me the part that remembers how it felt when he threatened the lives of me and my unborn child i just i guess i just fighting with myself over it i can see that said ginny nodding but you cantlet the past rule over your future i think even snape has learned that i know which is why i planning to tell him tonight that i want to stay with him hermione stated decisively ginny gave a happy squeal and hugged her friend sure i ll admit i will probably have doubts for a while but i have even more doubts about doing this without him he as vital to me as breathing ginny regarded her friend happily she knew how difficult it was for hermione unlike her the former head girl was an only child it was difficult to not see things in a purely black and white way attributing an angry countenance with uncontrolled hostility severus snape had been a bastard to her one way or another for ten years it was going to take time to completely get over that but at least hermione was willing to give her husband the benefit of the doubt it was quite the risk she was willing to take but not a long shot as many might believe thought ginny so what are you going to do for him what do you mean asked hermione surprised i mean how are you going to tell him you re not just going to spring it on him during dinner are you no the older girl protested i have plans ginny gazed at her impatiently well with a mischievous glint in her eye hermione smiled innocently whatever do you mean ginny mione you know exactly what i ooh is that a locket this would be perfect for her hermione snape look ginny it gold and has a place for two stones on the front i could put a picture of severus and me inside of it hermione jane snape ginny growled menacingly an emerald and a ruby you think i ll tell you what i think i think you better answer the bloody question before i strangle you hermione almost laughed at her friend fiery temper it was nothing compared to the snit severus could work himself into but impressive nonetheless she smirked is there something wrong ginny a sense of the ridiculousness of the situation washed over ginny and she abruptly calmed down knowing hermione would tell her but was enjoying her temper tantrum never let it be said that hermione snape could not appreciate the finer points of sadism she really was perfect for the potions master well ginny eyed the smirking witch impatiently hermione huffed in mock annoyance honestly okay let me buy this and i ll tell you i need to do some shopping anyway it was not long before the two women were back on the street headed to madame malkin s as they walked hermione told ginny of her plans severus snape in the meantime was waiting will ill disguised impatience in front of the office of the healers director at st mungo s he held a small box with a sample of the healing potion on his lap and was occupying his mind by thinking of all the things he could do with his wife once all this was over perhaps he could take her to avalon to visit the priestesses or to camelot to see what had become of king arthur dream she would love atlantis he thought especially since they had somehow managed to fuse magic and technology and he would have to take her back to the library in alexandria a small smile crept to his lips as he thought of his wife she truly was an amazing witch few women would have given a man like him a chance in the first place much less a second one after he buggered the first up and she was giving him a daughter that was the most amazing thing fear briefly gripped him as a small panicky voice in his mind reminded him that she had yet to give him a concrete decision severus however shoved it back into silence reminding himself that hermione rarely made any decision without considering all the possible scenarios she would tell him when she was damned good and ready but when she did he would know it was what she truly wanted two nurses walked by chattering excitedly the words marriage law caught his attention and he looked up to see one of them clutching a newspaper uh oh he thought did something else happen with that blasted law slightly regretting the fact that he no longer subscribed to that rag as his wife called it severus decided to ignore the women for the time being and try to wait patiently for the director by the time someone came to speak with severus he was on the fine edge of an angry tirade he was livid that director etherton kept him waiting for nearly two hours and was quite ready to storm out of the british healing institution and apparate to america where they would pay handsomely for his potion the first time in his life that he did something unselfish he thought and this was how he was repaid his face darkened in rage mr snape queried a soft voice his furious eyes snapped up to regard the trembling healer correction the trembling junior healer he frowned pinning the man with a cold stare that would be master snape or professor healer er dimmitt ma pro professor snape dimwit is more like it he thought snidely and your purpose here is to take me to see the director i suppose the boy began to shake fearfully regarding the angry man who held him in his fiery gaze er no actually sir i er i here to uh severus had had enough spit it out boy he snarled stammered the youthful healer what severus stood towering over the shorter man er whatever inanity the boy was about to speak was mercifully halted by a familiar voice behind the enraged potions master master snape he whirled to face the woman behind him healer brommel what an unexpected surprise he stated coldly she gave him a motherly frown now now professor no need to be angry i simply surprised to see you here director etherton requested i come discuss my healing potion with him today he frowned apparently he does not have time for me the healer nodded that not a surprise really considering what been going on today severus raised an eyebrow and what might i ask has been going on today the matronly woman regarded him curiously where is your wife professor he was not expecting that question shopping madam i believe she is making further preparations for our child she looked relieved oh thank goodness i was hoping that the two of you would stay together a feeling of dread washed over severus what do you mean mutely the mediwitch pulled a newspaper out of her pocket and handed it to snape i suggest you go find that good wife of yours master snape and make sure she knows how much you want to be with her once they repeal it you will have until midnight to reaffirm your vows shocked severus could only stare after her in disbelief as the healer strode away he quickly glanced over the paper it was not difficult to find front page news rarely is he thought wryly the truth revealed ministry marriage law recent investigations have revealed that the muggleborn pureblood marriage act is not the success publicized by the british ministry of magic information provided by unnamed sources within the ministry attest that while the act has been a success as far as the production of children is concerned it has not been healthy for the emotional state of the parents three years after the law was enacted the prophet has been given secret reports from the highest levels of our government illustrating the failures according to the reports the marriage act has cost the wizarding world more than 72 of its muggleborn population the majority of those who left surprisingly returned to the muggle world rather than be part of a world responsible for such a travesty of justice muggleborn witch tabitha harrison stated the law was the type of thing one would expect from a government 200 years ago not something to be found in the modern world i refused to be a part of a society that auctions off its citizens like chattel taking from them the most basic of human choices miss harrison was due to be married to pureblood wizard kerwin avery cousin to the notorious desmond avery an accused death eater healer margaret brommel chief healer of the maternity ward in st mungo hospital has been a very vocal opponent of the law from the beginning had this to say forcing two people to marry based on a committee opinion of compatibility is no way to preserve the wizarding world not only will we be producing children born in arranged marriages between spouses who despise one another we will be betraying everything young mr potter and his companions fought for the healer went on to say that the rate of suicide attempts and physical violence has escalated as a result of the law and that she fears children born of such a hostile union will grow up to be the next generation of dark wizards after all she continued lord voldemort was the product of a very hostile home environment as were most of his followers i think we might learn something from this minister fudge could not be contacted for comment but percy weasley assistant to the minister informed the press that all options and repercussions were being examined and that the ministry would do its utmost to resolve the situation to the benefit of all it is a well known fact that professor severus snape of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry has publicly opposed the resolution for years going so far as to appeal the legality of the decree five times within the past three years professor snape was chosen to be married to one of his former students miss hermione granger who is 20 years his junior such disparities between age and experience are one of the many challenges married couples have been forced to face upon their sudden betrothal and marriage to complete strangers the most common objection after the law itself was the manner in which couples were thrown together and forced to choose their spouse immediately opponents to the law suggested that a better course of action would have been to simply forbid purebloods from intermarrying and allow them a specified amount of time to choose a suitable spouse this could have allowed time for a mandatory dating period and given witches and wizards greater options in their choice of spouse it is well known that a number of those required to marry by law were already emotionally committed before being forced to marry strangers despite the existence of the fidelity charm many of those affected continue to have extramarital relations with previous paramours it is even rumoured that harry potter the saviour of the wizarding world has been affected by the law sources close to the young wizard claim he ironically lost the woman he loved to the marriage law no one has been named but reporter rita skeeter insists that the young wife of professor severus snape is the only woman mr potter has ever loved we at the prophet dearly hope this is not the case as it would be the ultimate injustice to the man who saved us all while the british ministry of magic refused to comment the united states department of thaumaturgy was very willing to put forth their opinion secretary john henderson minister of the american department of thaumaturgy was quoted as saying this is why we opposed this ridiculous law in the first place history has shown us that forced marriages for any reason have the distressing tendency to go badly the abuse and suicide statistics alone demonstrate that this is not an effective way of governing one citizens and that britain is in dire need of more than just a change in law albus dumbledore chief warlock of the wizengamot has called an emergency session today to review the information and make a decision on the ultimate fate of the law rumours have it that the great wizard is inclined to end the law as it is doing wizarding britain more harm than good headmaster dumbledore has weathered a great deal of criticism over the years as a result of his lack of action in opposing the law sources close to the sorcerer say that while he supported the law in theory he opposed the particulars but saw no viable alternatives one can only hope that now a new solution will be found a solution that will save wizarding britain without taking away the rights of its citizens upon finishing the article snape promptly forgot about his irritation with the director and strode purposefully toward the entrance he had a very important errand to run standing in madame malkins hermione snape regarded the paper in disbelief why is it that the ministry had to keep coming along to bugger up her life in the worst way possible now that she and severus were happy with each other the bloody bastards finally decided to end the law that brought them together it occurred to her that while she decided that she wanted to stay with him and yes even without the law she intended to she had no idea if he would want to be with her without the government forcing it on him would severus snape really want to be bound to a muggle born girl twenty years his junior who was pregnant with his child yes the answer floated up from the depths of her mind bringing with it a peace unlike anything she had ever imagined the glint of steel appeared in her eye as she finally decided without a doubt that severus was the man for her and by damn it she was going to keep him when ginny returned from her dress fitting she was surprised to see hermione standing near the stand of dresses clutching a newpaper in her hand she looked up and was startled at the steely determination she saw there what on earth was in that paper they ve finally done it gin they who and what did they do the ministry after three years the bloody bastards finally decided to repeal the marriage law or at least that what they re deciding now the wizengamot met this afternoon ginny looked surprised why werentyou told i imagine my views are rather vehemently on record besides it would be a conflict of interest since i affected by it no one else in the wizengamot was affected by the law hermione shook her head they were all above the age limit i the youngest member in more than 200 years yes but shouldntthey still ask you what you think the older girl shrugged carelessly it not like i ve made it a secret as to how i feel i sure albus is perfectly capable of representing my interests on this matter so you still oppose it questioned ginny oh goodness yes it one of the worst things that has happened to our world since voldemort but just because severus and i found happiness ginny does not mean that others will find it too they deserve a choice so what will you do ginny regarded her friend concerned find severus of course and tell him that he stuck with me and his daughter for the rest of his bloody life a delighted smile lit up ginny face and for the second time that day she let out a squeal of joy well let go find him then in short order the two young women made their purchases and headed out to st mungo s determined to find severus snape before anything else happened it would be her luck that the ministry would decree couples would not be allowed to remarry each other not if i can ruddy well help it she thought severus in the meantime was striding out of gringotts intending to find his wife or soon to be ex wife and make sure she married him a second time he carried his mother ring with him this time and was not about to take no for an answer not only did hermione carry his child but she was the love of his life he was not about to let her go memories of their past and the alternate timeline flashed through his mind as he thought over the past few months despite what he said to black severus honestly had expected his wife to choose potter over him admittedly she had yet to tell him she was staying with him but he had not served as a spy for twenty years without learning how to read people he suspected she simply was having difficulty figuring out what to say in that way hermione was like him his eyes raked over the scurrying residents of hogsmeade hoping to catch a flash of curly brown hair next to red thankful for the first time since the war that he still projected an intimidating image severus wended his way through the parting crowd intent on locating his wife he towered over most witches and wizards so it was not difficult for him to scan the masses while moving forward a flash of brown caught his eye drawing his gaze to the far away entrance of madame malkin s there she was he felt a surge of exhilaration and nervousness at the sight of her the fading light of the sun illuminated the amber highlights in her hair surrounding her head with a soft golden halo her eyes met his warmth washing through him at the surge of joy he saw there he gave her a tentative smile continuing forward to meet what he hoped was his future suddenly the crack of several apparitions sounded in the street causing curious bystanders to glance around in search of the arrivals the crowd around severus convulsed and then scattered as the frightened onlookers spotted four death eaters gathering himself to appareate severus swore as he felt the anti apparition wards snap back into place still swearing he whipped out his wand and began frantically pushing his way through the panicked wizards struggling to reach his wife before it was too late he recognized the four people surrounding hermione and none of them was likely to offer her mercy especially the parkinson girl hermione for her part was startled and just a bit frightened by the sudden appearance of four death eaters in the town marketplace her wand was in her hand without conscious thought and she noted with approval that ginny had assumed a ready stance as well the evil bastards may ultimately be victorious but it would not be without cost one of the death eaters stepped forward granger how nice of you to join us on this fine day getting along well i hope i notice you are yet again without your big bad prat of a husband finding his entertainment elsewhere i presume fury flashed in hermione eyes at the slytherin girl implication she opened her mouth to respond but ginny beat her to it what the matter parkinson jealous or are you still sore about snape rejecting your advances hermione glanced at her friend startled without response the fiery gryffindor continued maybe it was you ugly pug face that was his problem or no your cow like body perhaps she smiled maliciously no i know what it was your total and absolute inability to form a coherent sentence desperate though you thought he was surely even you didntthink professor snape would lower himself to shagging a mindless bint like you hermione saw the rage in pansy eyes turn to hatred ginny stupify ginny was waiting for the curse and merely stepped aside as it blasted past her her malfoy like smirk never wavered even as she responded in kind expelliarmus curses began to fly as the other death eaters joined in hermione spent her time deflecting the spells leaving parkinson and ginny to duel it out her friend was perfectly capable of handling herself but the other two were using dark curses she recognized as designed to inflict pain and cause injury she briefly wondered why neither of them used unforgivables but then remembered the ministry new law on that usage of an unforgivable was an immediate death sentence the dementors binding had been changed to allow them to hunt and kill anyone utilizing the curses they were swift and merciless and no bribe could deter them protego stupify depulso hermione found herself fighting better than she had even in the war against voldemort the fear she felt for her husband and child not to mention her friend lent her a strength that was allowing her to far surpass her previous magical accomplishments she never noticed when she began casting wandlessly firing off spell after spell to protect her and the youngest weasley come on parkinson where that slytherin cunning or is your pig like nature too overpowering for the snake in your soul taunted ginny the angry girl gave a shriek of rage ginny cast three spells in succession using the distraction her comments caused the other witch to her advantage protego expelliarmus stupify pansy dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes leaving ginny malfoy standing nearby wand in hand her attention turned to the ongoing battle next to her hermione still fought two others which impressed the fiery tempered girl to no end but the third remained apart impassively watching the battle she struggled with the desire to watch him and the need to help her friend he appeared to be waiting for something but what it was she could not fathom before she could make her decision however his wand was pointed at her eradico reacting without thought she dove aside hoping she could get behind something before the spell hit the sickly purple light destroyed the crate next to her the force of the explosion flinging her into the nearby wall reality twisted as her head hit the stone with a sharp crack her vision blurred ginny struggled to stand determined to help hermione there were only two death eaters standing now the one who attacked her and the one she swore looked like avery she was horrified to note that hermione appeared to be pushing past her endurance after fighting two highly capable death eaters she reached for her wand only to realize she must have dropped it when she hit the wall ginny looked around desperately hoping to spot the thin shaft of willow nearby there it had rolled into a crevice on the walkway a furtive glance toward her attacker made her aware of his fast approach so she lunged for the wand praying she could grab it before he got a curse off expelliarmus the wand skittered away and she turned to face her doom wishing she could see draco one last time she met the burning eyes of the death eater as he took aim avada sectusampura ginny flinched as the deep masculine voice echoed through the now empty street but the expected curse never came instead she heard the distinctive thud of a body hitting the ground she opened her eyes in time to see severus snape swoop by only to dive into a magical duel with the man intent on harming his wife together they fought side by side like during the war and for a moment ginny was stunned at the sight then she came to her senses and continued searching for her wand draco would surely take her to task for getting distracted during a death eater battle severus faced off with the man he knew as desmond avery notorious death eater and one time friend the streets were clear now so the danger of accidentally hitting an innocent wizard or witch was low but he was trying to abide by civilized rules and duel within the ministry dictates avery on the other hand had no such qualms he was doing his damnedest to do as much harm to hermione snape as possible she had long since given up trying to curse the man instead concentrating on defending herself and her child severus appearance brought a feeling of relief she never imagined since she knew he would keep them safe and make sure the death eater was brought to justice part of her wished he could just kill the evil wizard and get it over with she was thankful on the other hand by his restraint avery was blocking everything snape threw at him which spoke volumes about how the man had been spending his time during the past three years with the uncommon insight he was known for severus realized all this was specifically set up so avery had the chance to get even for his treachery his dark eyes darted to the side wondering where avery hidden ally was what happened next was simply a matter of timing circumstance and the natural course of things when a pregnant woman fights off multiple death eaters severus snape eyes widened in horror as his wife stumbled failing to block avery next curse time slowed as he analyzed the situation and made his choice knowing he was condemning his wife to a lifetime without him at least potter would be there faster than thought severus grabbed hermione and interposed his body between her and the oncoming curse as the pain struck he met his wife horrified eyes trying with every ounce of will he had left to convey his love for her he fell barely noting the flare of hatred on her face as she pointed her wand at the surprised death eater two voices in concert cast the spell petrificus totalus avery stiffened and fell a fact which hermione completely ignored nor did she notice the aurors apparating into the street or the horrified gasps at the sheer amount of blood pouring from severus body someone was screaming it was her pleading and begging him not to leave her alone but the light in his eyes began to fade i love you hermione harry potter took in the scene before him enraged that they dared to attack his best friend then he saw the blood and its source hermione screams drawing his attention stay with me she begged gripping his hand tightly the aurors stood around dumbfounded no doubt because they never imagined severus snape would be the object of such unbounded love it royally hacked harry off you he pointed to a nearby auror y yes mr potter dontjust stand there you idiot summon a healer not waiting for the flustered young man to reply he rushed over to hermione who was now sobbing on her husband chest quietly begging him to hang on just a little longer he knelt next to her a healer is on the way mione he ll be fine they ll be here soon and he ll be all better a weak raspy voice responded ever the optimist eh potter dark eyes met his conveying without words the reality of the situation severus snape was dying and he knew it no harry whispered he shook his head no severus you are not going to die i wont let you severus coughed blood staining his smirking lips you cantsave everyone harry but you can promise me something hermione was now weeping beyond words at the knowledge her husband was dying anything severus another smirk care for her potter and my child my daughter tears filled harry eyes as he gazed down on the dying man he clasped the hand of the man he had hated most of his life i promise severus breathing took on a wet wheezing sound all nearby knew it was a bad sign having been survivors of the war with voldemort ginny harry hermione and several of the aurors knew what a mortal wound was and that no healer no potion could cure it then it hit him correction no ordinary potion harry frantically began searching snape pockets hermione sat up and eyed him incredulously wondering what the hell happened to her best friend the potion mione didnt you say he was testing it her amber eyes widened and she joined harry in his search they quickly patted the dying professor down searching the pockets of his robes jacket and even his boots despair filled her as hermione realized he must have used it up at the hospital she shook her head it not here harry but he was supposed to test it at st mungo today there has to be some left i ll go to the castle where does he keep it it it in the storage room a slight glimmer of hope began to shine in her eyes as she regarded her oldest friend what does it look like it gold and has a slight glow to it you cantmiss it it like nothing anyone has ever seen you mean like this hermione started as ginny held out the glowing vial she hesitated only a moment before uncorking the small tube harry held the tall man down helping his desperate friend upend the flask into snape mouth rubbing his throat to trigger the swallowing reflex they all held their breaths for a moment afraid the potion had been given too late but then his throat muscles contracted as he swallowed the glowing liquid like with the panther the results were startling severus wounds began to close over beginning with the minor ones inflicted in the duel color returned to his cheeks and the flow of blood from his back stopped he coughed the blood from his lungs being expelled by the magic of the healing elixir his eyes closed but not before the dark and now lively orbs met those of his wife she felt a moment of panic but then sighed in relief as she felt the strong beat of his heart the crack of an apparition startled several of the aurors moving aside as the strong voice hermione recognized as healer brommel ordered them about out of my way she commanded in moments she was at severus side running her wand over his body to diagnose his injuries she looked up at hermione in wonder he almost completely healed hermione silently handed over the now empty vial she was surprised when the healer chuckled i suppose everything happens for a reason excuse me healer brommel the matronly woman gazed at the potions master young wife fondly it seems director etherton was too busy to see your husband today that seems fortuitous considering the circumstances hermione choked caught between the urge to laugh and cry one look at her husband was enough to send her into a fit of weeping however harry pulled her into his arms murmuring to her that everything would be all right that severus was fine and would make a full recovery at the healer direction he helped her up and then held her as the matron used her emergency portkey to take them to st mungo s there they were led to a waiting area where harry used every trick he knew to calm her down the healers wanted to make sure severus was healing normally but afterwards they said hermione would be permitted to join her husband in his room hours later hermione was settled at her husband side eyes drinking in the sight of his peaceful face he was so handsome like this she thought her hand gently brushing his cheek when he normally slept it was still with a slight air of defensiveness and mistrust that was the legacy of his days as a spy it amazed her that he was able to adjust to sleeping with her so quickly but she supposed that three years of living together had done something to place her inside his defenses that he trusted her was a revelation she wished she had years ago maybe then she would have been more open with her feelings the soft creak of the door behind her alerted her to someone entry and it was with lightning reflexes that she whipped out her wand and unerringly pointed it at the intruder the startled emerald eyes of her best friend met hers hello mione a bit jumpy are we his roguish grin caused her to chuckle as she put her wand away sorry harry just making sure no one hurts severus she stood and permitted him to engulf her in his warm embrace hermione was surprised at how tightly he wrapped his arms around her harry she gasped harry can t breathe he abruptly let her go sorry mione i just his throat closed as he looked at his best friend and the love of his life he blinked rapidly to clear his watery vision i just glad you re okay touched by the raw emotion she saw in his face hermione pulled him into a tight hug i okay harry the last death eaters are in azkaban and we donthave to worry about them any more holding her close he nodded avery getting the kiss for what he did to snape that curse wasntan unforgivable but it should have been something that dark i cantbelieve he cast it at you tears welled in hermione eyes as she thought of the damage it did to her husband damage that would have been done to her and their child had he not intervened her grip tightened good i dontwant that bastard to ever try and hurt my family ever again she whispered fiercely how he doing she pulled back face lighting up like the sun he going to be fine a full recovery says healer brommel better actually since the potion healed a lot of his old wounds and the lingering damage of voldemort abuse harry smiled good he certainly deserves it i cantimagine what he had to go through but oh that reminds me when snape wakes up give him this for me will you it about three years late but when has the ministry ever done anything in a timely manner he handed her a small flat velvet box she eyed it curiously you can see what it is when you give it to him mione i sure you can wait until then harry eyes twinkled in merriment as his best friend gave him a scowl worthy of the potions master himself and tell him that his belongings are with albus so he doesnthave to worry about losing anything hermione was puzzled but she made a mental note to let him know harry probably meant the impervious vial and his wand i ll let him know thanks harry you re welcome mione his eyes turned sad for a moment before resuming their normally cheerful fa ade she did not appear to notice i ll be back to check on you tomorrow if he wakes up before i get back tell him i said thanks for protecting you harry basked in the warm glow of her smile i ll let him know harry thank you for saving him she hugged him tightly i dontknow what i would have done if i had lost him his arms snaked around her and squeezed dontthink about that mione he okay and i expect to be receiving an invitation to your wedding very soon i hope so hermione said worriedly dontworry mione he not going to let you go not after all this you ll be fine thanks harry g night mione goodnight harry hermione turned back to her husband soon to be husband and continued her vigil she could not wait until he woke up something told her that harry was right and things were going to work out well for all of them whew that was a close one eh snape severus opened his eyes to find himself on a bed in st mungo s to his eternal joy sirius black was perched on the edge of his bed watching gleefully as he tried to make sense of what happened what the bloody hell are you doing here he rasped ah my dear snape that is the question is it not why am i here why do you think i here bugger because i dead and you want to taunt me with that fact he sat up scowling at black at least i got to resolve things with hermione so nothing you say can affect me you mangy mutt whoa severus i not here to taunt anyone although if pettigrew were still alive get on with it black actually i just here to check up on you make sure you re not going to be an idiot about this marriage law repeal thing gee thanks severus said dryly i am overwhelmed by your incredible confidence oh cut the crap snape you and i both know that you were thinking about telling hermione she would be better off with someone else like harry and pushing her away like you usually do i he hated to admit it but the dog was right as soon as he saw the death eaters it occurred to him that she and their child would be off with someone else that maybe he had been premature in taking his grandmother ring from the vault see you re an idiot you re not helping black now tell me why you think she ll be safer with harry the man who defeated voldemort potter is not a mere two steps away from being thought of as the scourge of the wizarding world nor is he the great traitor to the purebloods he gave sirius an unusually vulnerable look she will never be safe with me nor will our child sirius sighed frustrated at the dark wizard foolishness look snape she always going to be hunted in one way or another she either the best friend and love of the man who defeated voldemort or the wife of the former death eater spy beyond that she muggle born smarter than most pure bloods in the world and is unapologetic about her viewpoints not to mention the fact that she was one of the three that defeated he who is now dead as a doornail she deserves to make her own choice of what she will do with her life and who she will do it with he placed a hand on snape shoulder dontbe a fool and push it all away without giving her a chance severus was surprised at his old enemy insight hermione was a strong willed woman who would never truly be accepted by wizarding society fortunately it would only bother her on rare occasions especially with him and she would still have potter as her best friend and confident the boy loved her enough to be happy with whatever choice she made and while he would be a wonderful father he would not necessarily be the husband that hermione needed sometimes she needed someone to take care of her in ways that would never occur to potter his eyes swept the room stopping at the sight of his sleeping wife she held his hand tightly like she was afraid he would leave her while she rested the sight tugged at his heart she loved him he suddenly grinned she loved him it was as if the world suddenly lit up like dumbledore robes hermione snape nee granger loved him and he would be damned if he let her out of his life he was going to give her his grandmother ring and if she stayed with him he would spend every day of the rest of his life making sure she knew how intelligent beautiful and amazing she was he did not need to glance back at sirius to know he was smirking he could feel the arrogance from where he stood very well black you are correct i cannot leave my wife and the mother of my child i would be remiss in my sirius slapped him on the back oh stifle it you old bat you love her and you want to spend the rest of your creepy life with her he flashed snape a broad grin my work here is done snape it will be some time before i see you again the smiling wizard held out his hand good luck severus severus gripped it firmly silently offering thanks and forgiveness for everything black had done try not to cause too much trouble in the afterlife bl sirius i d prefer not to have an endless array of pranks to look forward to he hesitated but only for the slightest of moments thank you with a tip of his nonexistent hat sirius walked toward the door whistling cheerfully he paused flashing snape another smirk and then waved his wand severus found himself back in his body groaning at the amount of pain he felt from his injuries suddenly he was engulfed in a tangle of soft limbs and unruly hair severus cried hermione as she wrapped herself around his prone form oh god severus i was afraid you re all right oh please be all right i love you her sobbing tears struck him to the heart as he realized how much his near death had hurt her never again he promised hugging her tightly shhhhh i here love i am not going anywhere his long fingered hands stroked her hair soothingly gently coaxing her to release all the pent up emotion from the past few days out in the hallway harry watched as his best friend and husband were reunited smiling softly at her unrestrained emotions she had been on the quick road to a serious meltdown since she almost left snape and it warmed his heart to see the two reunited black eyes met his and it was with shock that harry realized snape mental shields were down leaving him open for the first time since harry met him knowing he could never betray hermione trust harry simply nodded acknowledging that the time had come for the two of them to end the undeclared war between them harry turned away confident that his best friend was in good hands and willing himself to leave his impossible dream behind hermione was his life and as long as she was happy he was content the road to his own happiness would be long but he was confident that someday he would find what severus and hermione possessed at last he paused for a moment thinking he felt a comforting hand on his shoulder but no one was there and he continued on alone several days later the hospital released severus snape to return home to hogwart s hermione could hardly contain her excitement amusing her husband who noticed her fidgeting near the door eyeing him as he packed up the unexpected gifts and cards it was nearly overwhelming to see the outpouring of care given him by the weasleys hogwarts staff several members of the potions guild former students and assorted others he would never have imagined it brought his mind back to his funeral reminding him that he was not nearly as alone as he always thought potter had been scarce these past few days but as severus packed the final gift the young wizard strolled in chatting with healer brommel the matron smiled upon seeing him ah severus i see you are prepared to leave us not for the want of your company healer i merely wish to return home with my wife she smiled indulgently of course you do dear that why i here to check you out now lift up your shirt there a good lad severus winced as she poked him a few times with her wand his chest and back still sore from avery curse he hated to imagine what the damage must look like it healing well you just continue applying that salve for the next two weeks master snape and you ll be as good as new in no time thank you healer brommel i appreciate your efforts he nodded formally to the matron oh never you mind master snape it was your potion that did most of the work i merely cleaned up some things she winked that little brew of yours might make it possible for me to finally visit my sister in australia now take care of yourself lad and that pretty wife of yours hermione and severus exchanged a loving glance i will madam harry strolled over and picked up the box of snape things so are we ready to blow this popsicle stand hermione chuckled at her husband confounded look linking her arm with his let go the three of them returned to hogwart s and to severus irritation harry and hermione ganged up on him to make sure he continued to rest for the next few days as the healer ordered hermione offered to teach potions while the professor was indisposed having built him a comfortable nest of pillows and blankets on their bed with a shelf of self renewing books for him to read while she was in class it only took two tedious days for severus to reach the limits of his patience especially since the wizengamot was still deliberating over the marriage law issue dumbledore was conspicuous in his absence which worried the recovering wizard a great deal his fear was that the fallout from the situation would lead the wizengamot to create some other ridiculous rule that would prevent him and his wife from remarrying despite what healer brommel said the verdict was still undetermined hopeful that things would go the way he wished however severus spent the next few days of his week long enforced rest period working on what he was going to do once the decision was reached if he only had until midnight the same day to renew his vows then by god he was going to make sure she received the best ceremony he could give her ginny malfoy was invaluable in his plans aiding him in his arrangements while keeping them secret from his frighteningly brilliant wife by the time the wizengamot made their decision severus was ready severus lay abed reading the latest american potions journal when a ministry owl swooped in and dropped a scroll on the bed an unexpected feeling of dread washed over him as he reached for the parchment that held the shape of his future despite expecting the news his hand was still shaking as he picked it up professor severus salazar snape hogwart potion master we are pleased to inform you that the muggle born pure blood marriage act has been repealed thanks to the efforts of the united states and several other countries it is no longer necessary to require the births of half bloods as a result the act has been rescinded and all couples married because of it are free to dissolve or renew their marriage vows as they see fit annulments will be granted at the behest of one partner but both must be willing for a renewal renewals must take place within two weeks to be valid arrangements will be made for the joint custody of any children resulting in the marriage please inform this office of your intentions within one week of receiving this letter glenda harris the ministry office of marital affairs a broad grin broke out on severus face as he realized he would have the chance to implement his most extravagant plan quickly sending a note off to the malfoys he began to make the preparations necessary hermione was going to love this hopefully meanwhile hermione potions class had been interrupted by the intrusion of a ministry owl bearing the same letter her stomach twisted when she read it her emotions at odds with the thoughts in her head severus made it quite clear to her that he was not interested in a divorce but that did not make it any easier to think about the dissolution of their marriage her eyes fell to the plain gold band on her finger after three years the metal had dulled and was covered in scratches she knew he bought it at a jewelry store in hogsmeade paying as little money as possible while getting something that did not look completely cheap it still held the iridescent sheen from their ceremony she thought with a smile it was nice to know the magic still held strong despite everything heh hem professor granger hermione looked up startled he class stared back at her some gazing worriedly at the scroll in her hands she had forgotten completely about them oh i m er sorry yes now where were we placing the scroll on her desk she picked up her notes and continued the lecture salamander bile is commonly found in brazil in the northern mountains it is particularly valuable in burn salves for obvious reasons but can also be used as part of what miss greenburry the rest of her classes continued uninterrupted but hermione thoughts were barely on topic instead she was mentally making her plans to inform severus of her desire to remain with him admittedly he no doubt got the message by her reaction to his injuries but she still wanted to do something extravagant to let him no in no uncertain terms that she loved him without reservation plans flickered in and out of her mind all day some rejected and others becoming part of what evolved into a to do list of things to do for her husband between classes she sent off an owl to ginny requesting that she find some way to get severus away from the school for a few hours a brief okay was all she received but it was enough by the time class ended she was ready hermione rushed back to the chambers she shared with severus intent on implementing her plan a short note was placed on the squat oak table near the door and the rooms were dark and deserted heart racing she picked up the note hermione you have two hours until severus returns ginny a brilliant smile lit her face and she whipped out her wand quickly moving the furniture and transforming the living area into a softly lit romantic setting perfect for her intentions racing about she levitated candles selected music and carefully laid out the array of desserts helpfully provided by the house elves tall elegant flutes and champagne completed the scene and it was with great satisfaction that she regarded her work he going to love this she murmured hermione was pleased he would finally see the beautiful amber nightgown she wore for him years ago a small part of her mind remembered the end result of that attempted seduction but she felt it was a good way to move beyond the past and embrace a future with severus her lips curved into a wicked smirk besides she wanted to see his face when he saw her in it her preparations for the room took only a half hour but she still rushed about knowing it would take longer to beautify herself severus voice chastised her mentally for the thought however even he had to admit that while he thought her naturally beautiful it took a great deal of effort to wrestle the unruly mass of her hair into something truly spectacular meanwhile severus snape was running all over hogsmeade quickly gathering the long list of items given him by the malfoys for tonight ceremony he had hoped to be back to his rooms by the time she was out of class but the machinations of the wily mrs malfoy prevented that leaving him frustrated and annoyed that he would not be there his intentions were to drop to his knees immediately after kissing his wife in greeting and ask her to marry him tonight for all time now he would have to figure out a better way to bring the topic into conversation perhaps over dinner two hours later found severus standing in front of his own door nervous unlike anything he experienced before he wryly observed that when one took into consideration his former occupation as a spy against voldemort it spoke very loudly of the importance of this moment a pale hand reached down to reassuringly pat the small bulge of the ring box in his pocked while the other tightly gripped a magnificent floral arrangement designed by the potion master himself nodding in readiness he took a deep breath and opened the door stepping into darkness as soon as the warning wards went off outside the room hermione extinguished the lights taking her place at the center of her arrangement the door opened and the tall form of her husband to be stepped through carrying what appeared to be an elaborate bouquet of flowers she smiled at his thoughtfulness as the door closed activating the enchantment on the candles and bathing the room with a soft golden light severus heart nearly stopped as he gazed upon the angelic visage of his wife she was wearing the beautiful amber nightgown he remembered from his vision her hair piled atop her head in a style reminiscent of their wedding her amber jewelry sparkled in the dim light glowing candles floated around the room which appeared to be empty of furniture instead there lay a thick blue rug at the center of the room upon which sat a large silver tray bearing two crystal flutes champagne and an assortment of fruits and deserts the only thing missing from that tray he thought were the oysters he smirked at the thought of what fun they could have with the bowl of liquid chocolate hermione stepped forward to place a gentle kiss on his lips hello severus hermione he gently touched the amber necklace she wore his wondering eyes meeting hers you look stunning my dear these flowers are a mere shadow of your beauty but i hope you like them she smiled eyes twinkling with joy they re perfect severus thank you a flick of her hand propelled the bouquet across the room and into a crystal vase severus pulled her closer wandless magic my darling truly you are a witch of amazing talents he kissed her deeply his starry eyed wife stared at him for a few moments after they parted the need for patience warring with her desire for the smoldering eyed wizard it was all she could do to restrain herself mentally following the script for the evening hermione gently stroked his face before gliding gracefully over to the thick carpet dinner my love she asked eying him longingly it had been far too long since they were intimate damn those death eating bastards she thought smirking severus sauntered over to his wife i would prefer dessert my dear but as you wish his silky voice washed over her like warm liquid further weakening her restraint what was it that she had planned she looked up to begin her rehearsed speech only to find her husband standing less than a foot away she struggled to remember what she was supposed to say severus i er i uh oh bugger it grabbing the back of his neck hermione pulled her husband face to hers their lips meeting in a hungry kiss neither knew how much time passed before the warning bells sounded in severus head reminding him they had plans for the evening plans his wife was unaware of at the moment hermione my dear he gasped reluctantly pulling away i have something i wish to discuss with you throwing her formal plans out the window she smiled wickedly i all for a very deep discussion severus his groin tightened at her implication dear merlin was he going to have a tough time keeping his mind on task mentally he began revising his timetable to include a thorough seduction of his wife before they were due by the lake perhaps now would be a good time to begin then hermione hermione shivered as his deep seductive tone washed over her she was no longer even attempting to keep her mind on the plan her eyes lighted on the buttons of his collar and she grinned pitching her voice to be as sensual as possible she ran her hands up the front of the black wool coat perhaps i might help you relax severus two can play that game she thought severus was suddenly struck with the realization that his scheme to get hermione to marry him this very evening was being derailed while he was not unhappy with the way things were going he knew they needed to talk and hopefully agree to go through with the renewal although considering his wife behaviour it was probably not going to be difficult to persuade her gently restraining her hand he kissed it before pulling her to him bringing his chin to rest among her unruly curls hermione my darling perhaps we should talk first she sighed contentedly wrapping her arms around his waist talk about what severus this seems rather perfect to me a small unrestrained smile made its way to his lips indeed it is my dear but i had been hoping for a slightly different objective this evening she stepped back eyeing him curiously like what severus gave her a loving smile and then dropped to his knees pulling out the small black leather box he flicked it open and presented it to her disregarding his pre written monologue he spoke instead from what was in his heart hermione i regret every day i failed to tell you how much you meant to me once i came to realize it i know i do not deserve the love you have bestowed upon me these past three years but i ask you to allow me make it up to you every day for the rest of my life i he held out his grandmother ring this ring belonged to my grandmother estaira snape she made me promise i would never give this ring to someone i did not truly love his eyes met hers i found that love several years ago but was too blind to see it but no longer stay with me be my wife as we always dreamed it could be let me be the father to our child and devoted husband to you tears sparkled in her eyes as emotions long restrained burst forth after three years after countless nights of anguish and suffering she finally felt whole and loved by the man she chose to share her life she threw herself in his arms with a joyous cry yes a thousand times yes completely disregarding the rest of his plan severus pulled his wife to him intent upon demonstrating his love and devotion to her deep passionate kisses lead to more intimate expressions of affection and the two lovers spent the rest of the evening in bliss completely unaware of the world outside each other hermione sighed contentedly pleased at how the evening turned out despite the fact that severus seemed to have plans of his own she was thrilled that they both had the same intentions it was not quite what she had in mind the house elves would no doubt be disappointed that their repast went completely untouched but it was all worth it in the end now all they had to do was plan the wedding in less than two weeks severus she murmured his arms tightened around her yes my darling where do you want to get married was hogwart not a suitable choice love oh yes it was wonderful i just didntthink you would want something so elaborate the second time around suddenly he stiffened and sat up no no i afraid i do not confused hermione turned to face him i okay then how about we do something more simplistic severus leaped to his feet dear merlin what time is it a glance out the window produced a curse severus hermione found herself being pulled up as the frantic wizard seized her hand and bolted for the baby room severus what is going on he was silent as he dragged her into the unused chamber dispelling the avoidance charm she sensed upon nearing the room quickly you must get dressed we re overdue by the lake what severus what are you no time we re late in a flash he was gone racing toward their bedroom hermione shook her head at his odd behaviour he must have had something else planned shaking her head in amusement she stepped into the baby room her eyes widened as she took in the altered arrangement of the room instead of baby furniture and bright colors she found a large antique chest in the center of the room light produced by small floating tea lights reflected off a large gold rimmed mirror on the wall hermione stepped forward to open the chest and was startled as the lid raised by itself and a beautiful white gown arose from inside the dress was made of several layers of white chiffon over a loose chemise of radiant silk gold and silver ribbon accented the empire waist and lined the cap sleeves and bottom of the skirt delicate white and gold roses decorated the sweetheart neckline which ended with a larger jeweled rose at the center point part of her mind noted that the rose itself was made of small rubies with emeralds for a trefoil of leaves inside the chest was a matching pair of shoes complete with the larger jeweled rose a delicate shawl woven of thin gold thread and white silk accented with tiny rubies and emeralds and a velvet box containing a necklace bracelet and earrings set in gold with a type of gem she had never seen before it appeared red at one angle and green in the other eying the garb in wonder she stepped forward to gently touch the fine overlay of the dress it was made especially for you she started as severus deep voice spoke from the shadows beyond the door ginevra helped me pick the design of the dress and suggested certain alterations to make it suit you i made the jewelry hermione turned to face him awed and a bit confused but why he gave her a wry smile i was hoping you would say yes i thought it better to be prepared in the event that things went well than assume the worst as i am accustomed to doing smiling brilliantly hermione strode over to her husband and gave him a tight hug good because i was not about to let you go after all we ve been through especially knowing what you mean to me she winked you re stuck with me she touched her belly us severus he grinned and whirled her around careful to avoid jarring her stomach nothing shall ever give me greater joy my love he set her down now if we are to be at least somewhat close to on time perhaps you should get dressed hermione looked at him questioningly our wedding my dear i thought perhaps midnight under the full moon would be the perfect time but it not never underestimate the powers of albus dumbledore my dear a nd the willful interference of certain mangy mutts and their friends he thought shooing him out the door to his disappointment hermione excitedly began to dress feeling a euphoria which was absent during their first wedding a small box at the bottom of the chest revealed a beautiful diadem made of the same gold and red green gems as her necklace set the note with the box simply said wear me g d touching the ornament to her hair she was surprised when her hair magically smoothed and arranged itself into an intricate waterfall of curls atop her head only the shoes were left when there was a knock at the door mione you ready yet asked harry amusement evident in his voice i dontthink albus can hold the moon much longer with a flick of her wand the door was open revealing a now open mouthed harry potter in formal robes wow he said you look indescribably amazing he held out his arm may i escort you to your father m lady she laughingly took the preferred arm with a slight bow ignoring the silent pain she saw in his eyes knowing harry he would never want her to know how he was feeling quickly reaching for a facetious comment she said the first thing that came to mind it is my honor oh great harry potter destroyer of evil wizards wizard he corrected straightening his posture and adjusting his robes i only really destroyed voldemort the others went to azkaban she smiled at his grateful look or hell she smirked dontforget all those death eaters well this is a lovely topic for your wedding night drawled draco he and his wife were waiting in the living room which had been restored to its original configuration hermione smiled joyfully draco ginny i glad you came i suspect we re not the only ones commented draco snidely eying the open bottle of champagne on the mantle hermione blushed at the implication uh where severus glaring sternly at her husband ginny stood and walked over to hermione out by the lake you guys are running a little late a little snorted draco and we came to see if anything was wrong as in if you or severus decided to be idiots and were not going through with the wedding said the former slytherin with a smirk fortunately we ran into severus before we could embarrass you and ourselves by knocking at the door at an inopportune moment continued harry draco looked at him an awed look on his face wow harry i had no idea you were so articulate did you specifically look that up for a special occasion or has hermione been beating you with a dictionary ha ha harry said sourly are we ready to go yet i imagine severus is getting pretty frantic right about now ginny shrugged he can handle it tugging harry toward the door hermione gave the two malfoys a tight smile well we are going you are welcome to join us if you can find the time come on harry not looking back the two friends headed out to the lake the walk through hogwart was surprisingly comfortable while hermione still felt a small twinge of guilt about how harry was feeling she had finally come to peace with the fact that his love for her was enough to ensure he placed her happiness above his desire to be with her she only hoped he would find someone to complete his life the same way she had someday hopefully he knew how much she appreciated his love and support over the years mione yes harry i glad you re finally happy she paused before the great doors turning to face him thank you harry for everything you ve been your best friend he smiled as i should be he waved his hand the heavy doors creaked open moonlight streaming into the dark castle in the distance she could see the tall shape of her true love next to the forms of albus dumbledore minerva mcgonagall her parents the malfoys and to her surprise all the weasleys luna was standing serenely by her husband who seemed to be fidgeting nervously glancing at harry she nodded ready to step into the bright future before her finis well that the end thank you so much for allowing me to take you on this brief sojourn into an alternative world of the harry potter universe again i glad jkr created this wonderful world to play in and that you were nice enough to stick through my terrible lack of updates to the end i have enjoyed it greatly and hope you had as much fun reading it as i did writing it this is unfortunately going to be my last story for a long time as you can tell from the large time between updates i have been crazy busy and it been a challenge to write anything much less something good enough to post maybe once i finish school i ll have more time thanks again and farewell for now again thanks to everyone reading and thanks to vaughn for weeding through all of my prose to find my stupid errors it was a beautiful day at hogwarts the sky was clear and blue the flowers in bloom and spring was in the air well summer at least hermione reflected that she really needed a swift kick to the arse to get her out of the whimsical mood she found herself experiencing she couldnthelp herself today was a day that would stand out in her mind for the rest of her life she only hoped severus would agree her smiled waned as she thought of her stern husband they had been married for three years and it was obvious he still had no real desire to be married to her she had always hoped their forced marriage would develop into something genuine but it did not look like that was ever going to happen as a result today promised to be interesting the news she brought would either make him incredibly happy or send him into a rage unfortunately she was betting on the latter having children was something he never expressed an interest in and her pregnancy was going to come as a shock she sighed if only he could come to accept the idea of their marriage the first year had gone fairly well but then something happened to change his perspective probably the ministry she knew severus hated being forced into something and having his appeals rejected every six months no doubt affected him badly but one would think he would have come to terms with their marriage by this point even he should at least have some fondness for her after three years she gave herself a mental slap he did put her through university and provided her with everything she ever asked for except his love six months into their marriage she realized she was in love with him and he never gave any indication she was anything beyond a nuisance forced on him by the ministry bloody hell hermione knew it could not go on this way she could deal with the idea of him being cold and distant when it was just her she hated it but the last thing she wanted was to force him to pretend he had feelings for her she had always hoped he would come to love her as she loved him that certainly did not happen and now they were having a child if things stayed the same it would be a very bad environment for anyone to grow up in she refused to punish their child for the ministry machinations but she would have to see maybe severus would see reason she snorted not bloody likely the good news was that she had a plan if severus snape was so unhappy with her that he refused to have anything to do with their child then the time had come for her to leave the united states still offered amnesty to anyone victimized by the marriage law with her double degree in charms and potions she should easily be able to find a job her friend katherine invited her months ago and would be thrilled to host her and her unborn child as long as necessary she could start a new life and severus could be free to do whatever it was that he wanted she would not ask for a divorce which meant the ministry could not force him to marry another by wizarding law they would remain married for five more years by then he would be 45 and ineligible for remarriage yes that would do if he rejected her again he was not there when she arrived in their chambers she went to her room and retrieved the book she had been reading and settled in front of the fire despite her interest in the topic however her mind refused to focus how many times had she sat in this same chair reading a book and waiting for her husband to return from his potions lab she sighed far too often as of late it was odd the first year of their marriage went fairly well they took time to get to know each other and began to settle into an enjoyment of the other company it was a little rocky for a few days after the first appeal with the wizengamot failed but severus bounced back and came to the conclusion that it was only a matter of time before they relented it hurt to know he wanted the marriage dissolved so badly but she knew he hated being bound to her against his will it was too bad she had fallen in love with him by then the rest of the year was less comfortable than the first half but she figured it was due to the strain of fighting the ministry unfortunately the second appeal changed things far more than she could have predicted shortly before his meeting with the ministry he took her to alexandria for their first anniversary it was magical she thought things were getting better but then the appeal failed and he pushed her even farther away making the next year a hell of indifference and legally obligated attention she wondered what happened when they returned one night of bliss and the next morning it was chilly as the arctic why did he suddenly turn cold to her not that there was anything she could do about it she tried talking with him but she quickly learned that trying to get severus snape to talk about his emotions was like grabbing a blast ended screwt by the tail and pulling today that was not going to matter he was going to listen to her while she told him about their child and then they could make a decision on what to do she had a horrible feeling it was going to involve her leaving the preparations for a move to the united states were already underway she sent the paperwork in as soon as she suspected she was pregnant and draco malfoy worked his magic to get the process expedited thanks to the money her husband had given her for her education money she had not needed thanks to her scholarships she had a very comfortable nest egg to get her settled in america and through her pregnancy severus had insisted she keep the money and draco planned on helping in any way he could as did harry and she had not forgotten that albus dumbledore owed her she would not be bereft if things failed to work out please let them work out she prayed she had no desire for their child to grow up fatherless more than that however she did not want their child to grow up unwanted she had stayed for three years no more one way or another she would find out where she stood with severus and if there was any hope for them at all she jumped as the door flew open and her husband stormed into their chambers uh oh this did not bode well she waited patiently while he paced around the room like a wounded tiger his rage was palpable and she wondered what happened to set him off the ministry she remembered his final appeal with the ministry was today oh bloody hell tossing his robes aside he grabbed the bottle of firewhisky and poured himself a glass two drinks later he seemed to relax he turned his attention to her what are you doing here not an auspicious start she would not let herself be intimidated it would be all too easy to put this off but waiting for him to be in a good mood was like waiting for the pope to marry besides the americans would be expecting her to accept their invitation shortly after she received it and she would be damned if his little snit kept her from taking the opportunity to escape it was certainly looking more and more like that would be the case i uh i just wanted to talk to you she mentally ordered herself to be calm and looked him in the eyes the fury there was almost enough to make her just leave without consulting him it his child too she reminded herself about what uh our child you git i pregnant and want to know if you re going to be a father or a sperm donor children more specifically our children what severus it been three years you know the ministry isntgoing to change the marriage law enough to annul our marriage i d like to know what i could look forward to in the future will we ever have children good that a good neutral beginning find out how he feels first he stared at her stunned how the bloody hell can you ask that you want to bring a child into a marriage that exists only because the ministry forced it on us how could you be so selfish how could you even consider i would want children with you she winced at the distain in his voice let me tell you something hermione i never had any intentions on having children with anyone but the idea that i would be willing to bring a half blooded abomination into this world is beyond abhorrent i would never want to breed with a mudblood her eyes widened in shock was this the severus snape that betrayed voldemort to join the order of the phoenix her hand swung up to strike his cheek before she thought how dare you say such a thing to me severus snape is that what you think of me that i a mudblood not pure enough to have a child with why did you even marry me in the first place if you found me so repugnant fury suffused her as three years of a strained marriage and two years of total indifference got to her oh no let me you settled for the mudblood you know instead of a complete stranger well fuck you snape you can just go to hell if i never see you again it will be too soon she stood to leave but quickly found herself pinned against the wall her arms pinned above her never hit me again his voice was cold and dangerous like a death eater she felt a surge of fear as she remembered his past are you afraid good you should be you seem to have forgotten what i was what i will always be i will not change myself to accommodate your idealistic and unrealistic desires i am not a prince so i suggest you put aside your girlish dreams and grow up you seem to expect me to be satisfied with the dregs of wizarding society you forget yourself you forget your place i have provided far more for you than any reasonable expectation stated by that bloody law you have a degree a career and anything you ask within reason now you have the audacity to make demands upon my life and my future there will never be a child between us i would happily strangle it upon its birth before allowing a half blood to sully the snape name i suggest you keep to your contraceptive measures and make no attempt to force the issue he was crushing her against the wall his body against hers she could feel his excitement through his robes this was turning him on it disgusted her what had she been thinking severus snape was exactly what ron said he was a pure blood bigot who reveled in his prejudice and no doubt enjoyed the things he did at voldemort orders she knew he had raped and killed how much of that had he enjoyed evil wanker he probably only defected from voldemort because he knew the cause was doomed how could she have let herself be fooled the man was an opportunist of the first order she pushed him away dont touch me you say i filthy that i have contaminated your existence well at least i not an old and bitter man without a future you re one of the most brilliant people i have ever met yet what do you use it for in your past to kill people or make them suffer for being born different in the present to intimidate children into fearing your very presence how the mighty have fallen you ve gone from raping and killing helpless muggles with your buddies to abusing helpless children with your words good job snape i hope you remember this moment for the rest of your miserable life you are pathetic a pathetic bigot who will live alone and die alone leaving nothing but misery behind she gazed at him with loathing you disgust me if you are what being a pure blood is then i thrilled beyond belief that my blood is sullied pure blood certainly hasntproven itself to be anything but an excuse to hate heil severus she spun on her heel and stormed out of the room the potions master gazed after her for a moment and then the reality of his words struck his eyes widened in shock how could he say that everything he had just told her was directly out of the book of voldemort did he really believe all that was he still just an evil death eater without a master he glared at the door she never should have brought up the children issue every time they discussed it all three times it ended badly usually he was the one storming off however now he doubted things would ever be peaceful again if there was a surer way to get her to hate him he could not imagine he sank into his chair why had he said all that the ministry he did not think she knew today was the last hearing with the ministry on the marriage law he had gone though appeal after appeal hoping they would see reason unfortunately it seemed the law was doing exactly what it was designed to after the expected grumbling most pure bloods came to accept the decree after seeing the research all it took was a small group of children born during the first year to show them it actually worked far too many families suffered from the effects of inbreeding and they were all too happy to have a solution that was so simplistic after three years most of the pure bloods he knew were at least expecting a child not only that they were making sure their muggle born spouses received the best education money could buy ironically enough it was all thanks to the former miss hermione granger head girl of hogwarts since most pure bloods were interested in furthering their family status anything to raise their family in the eyes of the wizarding world was seen to be a positive thing thanks to the war with voldemort those families associated with the dark lord lost a lot of influence and power on the other hand many muggle born gained a lot of status because they stood with harry potter against the evil wizard marrying a muggle born became a sure way to raise the position of one family in wizarding society he himself garnered a great deal of respect by virtue of his marriage to hermione granger best friend to harry potter he found it ironic that his wife was largely responsible for the surge of education being encouraged by pure blood spouses no pure blood family wanted to be considered inferior and hermione granger was the best she became pinnacle toward which all muggle born strove pure bloods encouraged their muggle born spouses to raise their place in society by being like harry potter former girlfriend and no one wanted to be considered less than the snapes had lucius malfoy lived he would have been first in line to try and take hermione away from him the status she brought with her to any marriage was impressive by wizarding standards and he would have done anything to secure it for himself snape knew there were several wizards on the wizengamot that would gladly annul their marriage in order to get hermione for themselves it put him in a bad position he could get out of the marriage but both of them would be required to remarry she would probably leave the country instead his heart twinged at the thought it would be a great loss to wizarding england if such a brilliant witch moved to america he ignored the small voice that told him it would be a great personal loss as well bloody hell what was he thinking even if there had been a chance that he could make a successful marriage with hermione he ruined it with the parroting of his father ideals it was like an echo from the past but with the unpleasant realization that it was he saying it she must hate him he had to get out of here hermione was probably crying on potter shoulder right now he almost snarled at the mental image of the boy arms wrapped around his beautiful nubile young wife the thought propelled him out the door and down the steps to his private lab his current project was held in stasis waiting for the next ingredient there were three cauldrons involved he was currently working on combining the amoure potion an amplification potion and the standard healing draught to create a more powerful healing potion with the potential to heal a death wound he referred to it as the all heal potion and today plans called for the most sensitive ingredient to be added dragon blood was not easy to get and was very volatile he believed it would work well as a binding agent for the new potion there was only one way to find out he glanced at his notes to double check the amount and then measured it out carefully in a small glass tube he paused thinking briefly that hermione would have loved to be here for this and at that moment he realized she was too much a part of his life to push away he would apologize for his behaviour later perhaps he would plan a nice evening dinner followed by a non ministry required seduction the last time he did something like that she responded extremely well he should have continued the past year would probably have been a lot more pleasant he tipped the vial as the deep red liquid fell time seemed to slow for a moment as a memory of him performing this same action earlier in the day popped into his head horror suffused him as he realized he just doubled the amount of dragon blood in the all heal potion if he had time he would have thrown himself to the floor to avoid the resulting explosion as it was he barely had time to register his mistake before the potion exploded a diamond hard wave of force struck him knocking him across the room into one of the cabinets the glass shattered and pain similar to cruciatus flooded his senses in that moment he knew he was going to die images from his past flashed through his mind as he succumbed to pain and blood loss he saw the day he was married to hermione all the way through today terrible fight she had been right he knew he was an angry bitter man who would die alone leaving nothing but misery behind he had been given a chance to make a better life for himself and he screwed it up hermione hated him the pain he felt from his injuries was nothing compared to the crushing agony of knowing he had driven his wife away the light in his eyes faded i sorry hermione his words fell unheard in the silence awareness returned to severus an unknown amount of time later he was floating in darkness sweet warm comfortable darkness he had dreamed of it for so long and finally he was at peace i wonder if this is what it like to be dead he thought bloody hell snape when you go out you go out in style what the hell his eyes fluttered open only to close in horror as sirius black grinning face greeted him he was in hell oh no you don t snape you re awake now get up before i make you he knew it was no idle threat black would love to be able to prank him into consciousness bloody prat wait bloody dead prat what the he sat up blinking in confusion he was on the floor of his lab only it was daytime now and all evidence of the explosion he remembered was gone hermione must have come in and cleaned up he thought she did that when he got too busy to remember why did she leave him lying on the floor so are you just going to sit there or are you going to stand up and take it like a man what the bloody hell are you on about black the dark haired gryffindor helped him to his feet smirking it just so happens snape that i here to welcome you to the afterlife what you re dead snape blew yourself up now to my everlasting joy you re stuck here with me i am in hell what did i do to deserve this if i may ask you can ask anything you want snape i ll see if i can answer what happened you were an idiot not that it out of the ordinary or anything but you were a much bigger idiot than usual what well after you broke your wife heart and stormed off like a child you came in here to work on the all heal potion snape interrupted i remember that there was an explosion what happened after that you died what you ve got to be kidding me potter this isntfunny i swear if this is a joke bloody hell snape it not a joke you re dead and i here to show you some things show me some things yeah call it penance for being such a git to you while we were in school i dontunderstand snape sometimes it behooves us to take a look back on our lives before moving on to the next phase of existence i speak from experience you ve got some serious issues to work out and i here to help you with the one that affected you the most and what would that be oh wise and inscrutable mutt sirius gestured obscenely your marriage you git snape stared at him in disbelief you re not serious the animagus smirked i mean what makes you think my marriage mattered to me at all because snape the last think you said before you died was i sorry hermione silence there are some things i think you need to see snape to put your life into perspective for some stupid reason you pushed away the greatest gift anyone can offer another and i not sure you truly understand what you did what do you mean come with me it was a startling experience to be walking through the walls of hogwarts as they approached the dungeons snape realized he had a pretty good idea where they were going he frowned did sirius want him to see his wife relief that she would no longer have to put up with him he knew she wanted children but since they were bound by the fidelity charm she had no choice but to have him as the father not anymore he thought pain flared in his chest at the thought of her being with another man like potter his frown deepened they entered his chambers to hear the sounds of weeping coming from his bedroom shhhhh it okay mione i know it hurts that sounded like draco wife he headed for the room the sobbing grew louder as he drew near the bedroom and he slowed with the habit of two decades to see what was going on the sight of his wife curled up on his bed crying as if her world ended surprised him what you think she didntlove you snape jumped as sirius voice sounded in his ear bloody bastard mione you cantstay here forever you need to get ready they ll be expecting you to say something she sat up sniffling his heart twinged as he saw the ravages of extended weeping on her face even so she was still beautiful what do they expect me to say ginny i loved him but he hated me that i wish the bloody ministry would go fuck themselves she loved him i dontthink he hated you mione he just resented that bloody law you know how much he hated the idea of someone telling him what to do so he took it out on me for three years i sorry ginny i just he said she choked on a sob ginny rubbed her back reassuringly shhhh i know mione harry told me i think he let the hearing today get to him and the hearing from six months ago one year ago which was our anniversary by the way not to mention last year mione i just oh god ginny it all my fault i should have just left i shouldnthave said anything at least then he d be alive with another wail hermione threw herself in her friend arms left what did you think she would stay forever snape women like hermione will put up with being treated like crap for only so long take a look sirius waved his wand and the two men appeared in the chambers recognizable as harry potter s the young man was sitting at his desk grading papers when the door flew open and hermione came in she looked distraught eyes reddened from weeping and a look of hopelessness on her face harry stood up and rushed to take her in his arms ha i knew it she always said he was just a friend but i knew shut it snape and listen i take it things did not go well observed harry she shook her head hermione allowed herself to be led over to the now familiar couch by the fireplace and gratefully sank into her best friends comforting embrace he let her compose herself for a few moments before speaking so what happened pretty much what i expected he flipped out and went running down to the lab as usual he a sob escaped he said some things harry face hardened not terribly nice things i guessing she shook her head he he told me he wouldntever want to have children she paused to compose herself he didntwant to have children with a mudblood harry swore that ruddy bastard how dare he say that to you oh gods hermione i so sorry she threw herself into his arms again and he let her cry for a while meanwhile sirius was glaring at snape smooth move could you have possibly been more insulting snape actually felt a twinge of remorse for his words he had been looking for a way to hurt her and he certainly succeeded the pain in her eyes was rebuke enough for anyone he never meant to treat her like that i she surprised me black i just got back from the ministry i certainly wasntexpecting the inquisition on children i just lashed out yeah at your wife at the woman who for the gods only know what reason loved you he hung his head yes it will be alright love snape ears perked up what the hell was potter doing calling his wife love she sighed it will once i gone what where was she going what katherine says i can stay with her while i get settled in america i ve already filled out the amnesty forms and owled them to the u s department of thematurgy thanks to draco i should be hearing from them any day now draco helped her his godson bloody prat so you re finally going to do it things have changed harry i cantstay here anymore not with he reached out and took her hand i know i dontblame you you know i ll help you in any way i can she gave him a grateful smile thanks harry it means a lot her eyes grew distant what wrong with me what her eyes focused on his what am i doing wrong for three years i ve tried to be a good wife while making sure i didntneglect my goals or turn into someone i never wanted to be yet somehow i still managed to take the one man the ministry seemed to think was suited for me and drive him away am i really that horrible harry shrugged maybe he gay a giggle escaped before she could stop it harry severus snape is not gay his smirk told her he was not serious i know but it was worth it to see you smile she hugged him tightly thank you you re so good to me with a courtly gesture he kissed her hand and bowed i am at my lady service he met her eyes always harry i will always be here for you hermione you should know that i a harsh knock at the door stopped his words moments later a somber albus dumbledore entered the room he crossed to hermione and took her hands i sorry my dear but there been an accident severus he it was at this point the famed control of headmaster dumbledore deserted him how was he supposed to tell this gentle child that her husband was dead i sorry it took a moment for the words to register but when they did her eyes widened in horror where the lab but she was out the door before he could finish albus caught harry eyes and motioned for him to follow his best friend she was going to need him sirius and snape arrived just in time to see hermione fall weeping into harry arms smoke was billowing out of the laboratory and they could see a still pale form on the floor inside instinctively snape knew it was him what happened you got distracted snape too much dragon blood when you screw up you have to admit it big he remembered his last minute realization bloody hell thanks no problem was it foul play harry soft question startled the two men dumbledore shook his head unfortunately not it appears a simple matter of too much of the wrong ingredient it my fault the men stared at hermione it my fault we we f f fought and i we yelled and he she sniffed stormed out i with a wail she was back to weeping in the embrace of her best friend perhaps you should take her back to her room the headmaster suggested softly we ll go back to my rooms albus i think returning there might be too much right now he nodded understanding harry gently guided hermione back to his chambers within minutes he had her settled in his bedroom where she fell into an exhausted sleep he settled himself on the couch for the evening and lost himself in thought the one thing on his mind was the lovely young woman sleeping in the next room he found himself angry and sad at the same time why couldntthe bloody git just have run away he wondered he could compete with that he could not compete with a ghost damn you severus snape how could you do this to her snape watched the young man carefully thinking back to all the times he had foisted his company on them well him at least hermione welcomed his presence perhaps one of the reasons he hated potter had to do with the boy obvious feelings for his wife while he was never truly comfortable with the idea of being married to his former student he had gotten used to her over the years and felt a possessive flair whenever harry potter was around strange isntit what the hell are you talking about now black you jealous of harry you never really treated hermione like your wife yet you went all green eyed at the thought of her with other men that pretty bloody hypocritical dontyou think i i dontlike the idea of someone else moving in on my wife that all black despite my wishes to the contrary she is still my wife and i certainly am not going to share her with every whelp that comes sniffing around because he lonely possessive arentwe he eyed the potions master i guess it doesnt matter to you that harry loved her before you ever knew she was a woman not bloody likely potter had every chance to rubbish snape and you know it there was no way harry was going to risk the woman he loved while old voldie was still alive to hurt her if that bloody law hadntbeen passed they d probably be happily married by now and you d still be the same lonely sarcastic bastard you ve always been only this time you wouldnthave ruined a young woman life ruined i hardly think one can term our arrangement as ruining her life snape dark eyes bored into the angry gryffindor i gave her everything she wanted school clothes prospects influence do you honestly think she d have been invited to sit on the wizengamot if it werentfor her connection to my family she a muggle born for merlin sake you know how little regard the ministry has for them she she would have gotten pretty far on her own snape seeing as she was one of the three responsible for defeating voldemort she didntneed your charity sirius glared back snarling at his nemesis you gave her everything she wanted horseshit the only thing she ever wanted from you was your love or affection at the least and you couldntbe bothered to even try three years snape for three years you blew her off preferring the company of your bloody potions instead she loved you and you rejected her at every opportunity rejected since when i never knew how she felt black how was i supposed to return her affection if she never told me maybe had you paid attention to her you would have realized she told you in a thousand different ways every single day he gave snape an evil grin let take a look shall we sirius waved his wand and they found themselves back in his lab hermione was there holding a list and rummaging through his ingredients closet severus noticed she looked younger how far in the past were they for the next several minutes they watched as she arranged the ingredients for the wolfsbane potion on one of the benches with a cauldron ready to go the clock struck five and she quickly scribbled a short note and dashed out the door he glanced at the slip of paper severus i know you ve been really busy lately with newts and all so i thought you might want some help with remus potion all the ingredients have been prepared to your exacting standards which should save you some time i ll send dobby up with dinner around seven love hermione you think she did this because she was bored snape she cared she cared about the fact that you were driving yourself to exhaustion with the research on the all heal potion and your classes i told her i appreciated the help black besides she was far less busy than i it only made sense she help me out less busy eh i wonder sirius headed toward the door to their quarters and walked right through the wall severus growled in annoyance and followed he found the annoying wizard standing next to hermione they were in her office okay wolfsbane potion check healing potions check japanese check school work not bloody likely gods do i wish i had a time turner ah well it was worth it eh crooks he needs the help despite the fact that he d never ask for it oh i guess i should send albus a quick note letting him know i ve taken care of things she rummaged through her desk to find a small slip of parchment to send to the headmaster a quick flick of her wand and the message was written and on its way to his office courtesy of an owl with feathers the color of honey like her hair he recognized it as gelanor the owl he had gotten her for the first birthday they were together okay now that done time for homework snape was surprised to learn the pile of books on her desk was actually for her slew of classes at the time he had known hermione took a heavy class load but he had no idea how much he recognized it as her first year toward the end but already he could see several advanced texts advanced transfiguration ancient potions ritual magic level 5 charms runic symbology arithmancy 303 physics chemistry and defense against the dark arts dear lord no wonder she graduated early how did she do it time passed as snape watched his wife work her way through a mountain of homework she was not as over achieving on the length of her essays now preferring instead to get to the point in the most concise way possible he could not help but admire her thought processes as he watched her write it was early the next morning before she completed her last assignment and owled it off to the university she wearily dragged herself into the bathroom for a shower before getting ready for bed the revelation that she wore one of his old shirts to bed startled him he turned to black ready to leave when he noticed she had not gotten into bed as he expected instead she walked over to her mirror and chanted a spell snape eyebrow shot up as he saw himself reflected in the glass he was sitting by the fire in his chambers reading the latest issue of modern alchemy with a bottle of firewhisky nearby she gazed at him sadly and then gently touched the reflection good night severus i love you he stood there dumbfounded as the light faded and she crawled into bed she was asleep within moments wow your wife got great legs i have to say he had black pinned up against the wall in an instant you keep your eyes to yourself black she deserves better than your lewd commentary sirius held his gaze well she deserved better than the indifference of a greasy git who was too much of a coward to give her a chance so sod off so help me black you re the one that needs help snape remember you re the one that refused to see what is right in front of your eyes you re a bloody fool and if you think a bad attitude is going to change things you ve got a lot to learn why are you doing this black why show me all this if you cantfigure it out snape then you dontdeserve to know his eyes narrowed i have limited time but i ll help you as much as i can i owe both of you that much at least both of us i told you consider this my penance for how i treated you all those years and hermione she saved harry i owe her everything snape let him go turning away abruptly with a snarl i do hope you will be showing me something of substance during this post mortem absurdity i sure there are better things i can be doing with my time sirius smirked substance eh well if that what you want i have just the thing he waved his wand and their surroundings changed they appeared in the middle of hermione chambers just before she stormed in and pointed her wand at the bed a box stored underneath flew out and expanded into a small crate another gesture and the contents of her room began flying into the box after being reduced in size to fit it was with half her clothes in the air and tears in her eyes that ginny found hermione shortly after her arrival she gaped at the older girl you re finally doing it bloody hell hermione what happened alexandria that what i sick of it i refuse to stay a moment later in a place where i unwanted and unloved this is it ginny i going to america you ve been saying that for a while now hermione what about alexandria hermione turned to face her friend tears streaming down her face it was bloody fucking wonderful that what while we were there we spent a lot of time at the library of course exploring the surrounding area and even went on a cruise down the nile oh ginny it so beautiful there and there are dozens of small shops with the most interesting things that where i got you that bracelet ginny smiled it beautiful i hope you got something for yourself actually severus bought me something the red haired girl bounced with excitement what is it hermione pulled a necklace out from under her shirt it was a finely wrought gold chain braided into an intricate pattern with amber beads placed at regular intervals along its length a deep amber pendant engraved with the egyptian hieroglyphs for knowledge light and love hung from the sparkling chain the other side bore the hieroglyphic translation of her name oh wow that s incredible hermione smiled incredibly thoughtful as well it perfect and i guess i thought she choked slightly her eyes tearing up i thought it meant he was finally interested in something deeper than this pretense of a marriage ginny eyes turned sympathetic obviously i was wrong hermione said bitterly we got home if you can call it that and things seemed nice he even seduced me last night then today it was worse than before he refused to eat breakfast with me and yelled at me for trying to force him to be something he not he said i was being needy and that our contract never required that he do anything more than what he was doing my unrealistic expectations of love and friendship will never be satisfied she grabbed the necklace as if intending to rip it off snape stepped forward his hand extended to stop her she couldntdo it that bastard hermione screamed he convinced me he finally cared about me and i find out that the only reason he took me to alexandria and bought the necklace was because draco told him it would help keep me out of his greasy hair my hair is not greasy said the potions master indignantly i beg to differ snape i surprised you get near any open flame with that invitation to combustion on your head is there a point to this little display black watch and listen for a moment you slimy git black why do hermione continued i cantbelieve i had the time of my life only to come back here and be shoved back into the reality of being married to a man who hates me i cantdo this anymore dumbledore be damned i not wasting another moment of my life on him snape was stunned he never knew she had gone this far to leave him why had she never said anything what was she supposed to say snape you re being a prat so i leaving get a clue she wasntabout to hunt you down just to start another fight she looked disturbingly prepared for this eventuality of course she did what you think she was stupid you mean all this time she had a plan to leave but chose to stay boy you really are dense snape there were a number of places that were very vocal about their opposition of the marriage law the americans ruled it barbaric and offered refuge to anyone who fled to the u s her parents would have paid for her plane ticket she chose to stay because she cared about you that box was made shortly after you guys were married at ginny and harry insistence but she never considered using it until now snape was stunned so i guess this means he didntlike the book hermione laugh was slightly hysterical oh he loved the book he even seduced me in thanks that was awfully nice of him dontyou think ginny seemed taken aback at her friend bitterness you honestly think that was why he did it hermione sank to the floor physically and emotionally drained i dont know anymore he seemed so bloody sincere everything was wonderful ginny then he told me he hoped our little excursion would tide me over until next year he said draco suggested a trip and he was relieved to see the advice worked wonders to ease my pathetically romantic ideals he told the house elves to make sure to get me a piece of jewelry once a month to make me happy fury suffused her face it was a bribe ginny a fucking bribe to get me to stop mooning over him snape winced at the memory he had not meant to lose his temper like that but something about the way she gazed adoringly at him sent him into a rage especially after she seemed so enthusiastic about his appointment with the ministry later that day he honestly thought she wanted the marriage dissolved as much as he did and it hurt lashing out was how he handled pain such as that the red haired girl winced ouch wait you mean draco was the one who suggested the trip it was a nice try ginny at the very least i got a few good memories out of it i ll just have to edit out this morning oh hermione the ginger haired girl knelt and wrapped her arms around her it will get better we ll just get you over the pond and you can start over without the greasy git dragging you down is that the sound of someone disparaging my godfather draco arsenios malfoy what the bloody hell do you think you were doing what what did i do now hermione touched her friend shoulder it okay ginny he was just trying to help uh how was i trying to help granger you suggested a trip to alexandria to your godfather he grinned why yes i did how did it go ginny scowled at him what do you think bloody hell what did the old sod do now the trip was wonderful draco thank you for suggesting it although i have to say that telling him it was a great bribe to get me to leave him alone might not have been the best way to go about it draco stared at her incredulous he actually told you that she nodded blimey i never thought him for the daft sort what the hell did he do that for apparently he got the impression that i was being too demanding as a result of our time together i guess four days in a posh hotel with me was too much for his fragile little nerves to take with a flourish of her wand she sealed the box well he certainly wonthave to worry about that anymore wait what do you mean bloody hell you re leaving she pierced him with a glare what did you expect draco you honestly think i going to hang around just so i can get my token payment like a good little whore he seemed shocked at that i can finish my education at a college in the us i have enough money to set myself up for another two years and go to the berkeley institute near my friend katherine she at least wants me to be free of this bloody law and my blasted git of a husband but what about severus can bugger himself for all i care dumbledore can join him i not going to stay one more minute so i can be his live in tart she waved her wand and the box shrunk to fit in her pocket i sorry guys i cantstay anymore i ll miss you both ginny wrapped her arms around the older gryffindor i ll miss you too hermione promise me you ll write of course i will promise me you ll come visit i think i might be able to persuade a certain wealthy wizard to take a trip to america one of these days draco smirked it ll cost you but i ll see what i can do his wife swatted at him take care hermione i hate to see you go but thanks draco she gave him a hug before squaring her shoulders to march out the door snape watched her go wondering how she came to stay with him for another two years dumbledore he looked at sirius surprised what you mean the old man guilted her into coming back he gave her some song and dance about how you were starting to have feelings for her and didntknow how to handle them he wasntcompletely wrong yeah well we all know how that turned out he asked her to give it some more time like another year and promised to make sure she was given every opportunity he could arrange for her you thought your influence was responsible for getting her a seat on the wizengamot i hate to tell you it was really dumbledore it was a bribe for her to stay with you bloody hell why would he do that he was afraid of what you might do if forced to marry some mindless bint after hermione left you bet you never thought about that huh why didntshe leave after the year was up dumbledore offered the job at hogwarts and funding for her research something she would have needed years to get in the united states exactly when he plays the game he plays to win severus shook his head poor hermione she never had a chance bugger time to go with a wave of sirius wand they disappeared thank you so much to everyone that is reading this your encouragement means a great deal to me and i am incredibly happy you guys seem to like this little idea of mine and now on to the story so what your story on what happened in alexandria they were still in the dungeons but hermione was nowhere to be seen and it was now daylight snape wondered when in time they were now the present you might be interested in seeing this now alexandria he sighed draco recommended i do something big for our first anniversary i honestly didntsee the point but he said it would do a lot toward keeping things pleasant i thought of the things she liked and it seemed to me a trip to alexandria to see the great library would be something she would truly enjoy i made the arrangements and we left two days before our anniversary what about the necklace i saw it in a store there and it reminded me of he glared at sirius yes yes i know you re a dark and evil death eater with no capacity for human emotion so it reminded you of her hair he said softly the amber and gold were the exact colors of the highlights in her hair i thought it would look nice on her so why did you tell her it was a bribe i he sighed i didntwant her to think i was getting emotional over her and all the crap you said to her at breakfast i got upset because she seemed so happy about my meeting with the ministry and i was mad at myself for getting too emotionally involved during the trip dontlook at me like that black i thought the ministry was going to overturn that stupid law at any time i certainly didntwant to give her more ammunition for ridicule than she already had it was bad enough we had to have sex three times a week by order of the bloody fucking ministry ammunition for ridicule bloody hell snape when have you ever known hermione to ridicule anyone i blast the mangy dog had a point i have few doubts potter and weasley would have such restraint after she told them sirius grinned wonderful now i know what memory to show you next but first we wait what the sound of voices approaching the door silenced him do you think she going to be okay severus recognized the familiar burr of minerva mcgonagall voice albus responded i honestly dontknow minerva his death has affected her more severely than i would have expected especially considering especially considering how he treated her you can be truthful albus i seriously doubt severus snape is going to come back and take you to task for being honest the door opened and the two professors entered severus was shocked at how old dumbledore looked they sat down near the fire i should never have pressured her into marrying him minerva she could have fled to america and found happiness there they would have gladly taken a witch like her and helped her in any way possible she had no way of knowing that albus i should have told her what the agency made an offer they would send her to university for her degree if she agreed to join them for four years as an agent in the research division albus dumbledore how could you keep that from her i wanted severus to have a chance at happiness i honestly thought he liked her i thought they could be happy you thought he could be happy you didnteven give her a choice how dare you do such a thing to one of your own students albus dumbledore he was slipping away minerva he needed something to live for and she needed to have a future what is there now for her the ministry is going to force her to marry again and she ll never be free the headmaster shook his head severus succeeded in that much at least the changes to the marriage law state that a widowed spouse cannot be forced to marry again i believe they were simply trying to shut him up but in this case it works in our favor hermione will be able to stay in england without having to be bound to another pure blood thank merlin for small favors they sat quietly for a moment and then mcgonagall gave the older wizard a sharp look do you think he loved her i not sure i think he could have if he let himself i should never have let him continue on with his bloody obsession with ending the marriage law being reminded of his binding only served to make him angrier i imagine if he hadntbeen so angry things could have been different poor child indeed how do you think headmaster pro minerva the subject of their conversation stood hesitantly in the doorway come in child we were just waiting for you said albus standing up to greet her oh uh would you like some tea minerva smiled that would be lovely hermione busied herself with the implements of tea preparation so uh what brings the two of you here first and foremost my dear we wanted to see how you are doing said the headmaster as well as can be expected i suppose i ve been considering putting a poison in the water supply at the prophet however that last article slanderous and untrue i know i ve made sure a letter has been sent advising them to cease their attacks on severus said albus slanderous article snape arched an eyebrow at sirius said you were murdered by your wife as revenge for cheating on her with three hookers what that impossible dont i know it i guess you should be proud snape your former students seem to have a great deal of faith in your ability to confound the fidelity charm they actually have ministry officials investigating the matter as we speak surely you must be kidding fraid not most people dontbelieve the story that you accidentally screwed up and put the wrong ingredient in your potion they think hermione did it since it was so obvious you had no desire to have anything to do with her seeing as she young beautiful brilliant and desired by half the pure bloods in the wizarding world they canthelp but think you were either gay or interested in things she refused to consider oh for merlin s potions hermione startled statement caught his attention the current professor is not working out too well hermione more than five cauldrons blew up this week two of which he was the responsible party there have been more potions accidents during the past four weeks than during the last ten years under severus you are more than qualified to teach those classes the only thing you lack for a potions mastery is a year of teaching experience under a qualified master since i do believe i still qualify severus thought back to the last time he had seen his wife so radiant it was when he told her he was taking her to alexandria for their anniversary he never realized how important that trip was to her thank you headmaster i ve always wanted to get my mastery in potions severus didntthink it would be a good idea for my husband to supervise minerva snorted poppycock that was just an excuse hermione albus not a word severus snape is not an angel just because he dead and the sooner you realize that my dear the sooner you can get on with your life hermione and snape stared at the transfiguration professor in shock i know it is hard hermione minerva voice was gentle but with the hint of steel severus did not treat you as you deserved and you know it i know you loved him but the time has come for you to begin the healing process it will not do you any good to mope about i should know i dontunderstand my late husband died twenty years ago in the first war it was an arranged marriage similar to yours i loved him but he did not love me i pined for him for almost a decade before a certain meddling old wizard told me what a fool i was she touched her former student hand i know it will take a long time for you to get over it dear that is why you need to start as soon as you can bastard though he may have been i seriously doubt severus would have wanted you to mope about for months on end it only been a month minerva i think i doing pretty well not really my dear you have shown no change for all that time you still cry yourself to sleep every night wrapped in a piece of his clothing you visit his grave every day for at least an hour and you are still hardly eating you walk about the castle like a zombie and avoid both the dungeons and potions lab like the plague harry worried about you we re all worried about you you need to treat yourself better hermione albus gave her a significant look perhaps we might see you at dinner tonight hermione stared for a moment and then reluctantly nodded yes headmaster good then i believe we will leave you to your work hermione good afternoon good afternoon minerva headmaster it albus my dear the door clicked shut hermione stood there for a moment staring at the door before walking into the bedroom and collapsing on the bed in tears she cried as if her heart was broken and it was with a start that snape realized it truly was she really did love me ding ding ding get this man a prize shut it black bugger yourself snape for a man who sure prides himself on his intellect and observation you can be incredibly oh what the word dunderheaded snape cut him a glare she been there for you in every way since the day you were married and you treated her like a nuisance and a whore what a whore what the bloody hell is that supposed to mean you know if you treated every woman you had sex with over the years like you treated your wife then it no wonder you needed a law to get married snape lunged at him ho ho hit a sore spot did i you deserve it snape you have no idea what she went through every other day when the time came for you to perform your marital duties let see how did it go ah yes she would get into an easily removable nightgown you would come to her room never bringing her to yours i guess we couldnthave a mudblood dirty those pristine sheets you d shut the door and tell her to get undressed and into bed you d nox the lights and then remove your clothes with a spell a little foreplay to get her warmed up and you d do your business and leave immediately afterward did i leave anything out i didntthink she would want me there any longer than necessary he snarled did you ever bother to ask oh dontanswer i know this tune of course not why would you do something so sensitive and caring sirius eyes darkened in anger she cried herself to sleep every night that right snape every fucking night you came to her room three years of crying herself to sleep three nights a week that quite the track record and you say she loved me she cried because you treated her like a whore you prat snape was stunned you came you shagged and you left without a bloody goodnight the only thing that was missing was the cash on the drawer but i suppose that what the university education was supposed to be payment for services rendered too bad she didntneed it snape found his hands wrapped around black throat again as he shoved him against the wall what the truth hurts does it you rejected her at every turn but you still put her through college and provided for her what were you getting out of it i d say sex would be the logical response since you never asked her for anything else what was she supposed to think snape let him go appalled at the truth in his words sirius continued ruthlessly how do you think she felt she thought you hated her and because of that she hated herself she always had self esteem issues you know not because of her intellect you re the only teacher that derided that no it was her appearance she had problems with far too many young wizards found her too intimidating to approach they found her attractive but she was convinced she was ugly because no one told her otherwise even you did nothing to dispel the notion the potions professor sat down the hot wash of self hatred surging through him she going to move on snape but she never going to have the confidence in herself and her desirability that she should she beautiful and she ll never believe it harry will spend his life telling her and she will always doubt him because of you for the first time he began to understand her reticence to be seen with him it was not that she was ashamed of being with him she was ashamed of herself what had he done mione snape looked up to see harry potter standing in the doorway mione are you what wrong he sat on the bed and pulled her into his arms it okay love let it all out he gently rocked her until her sobs subsided he gently lifted her face and wiped away her tears what happened m minerva t told me i n needed to m move on he handed her a white handkerchief so she could blow her nose i oh harry i dont know what to do anymore harry hugged her tighter i know love i know it been really hard especially now i d say this is one of those cases of taking it one step at a time the severus snape twelve step recovery program she giggled he chuckled something like that hey why dontyou show me all those photos you took you can reminisce about the good times and maybe it will help lay the ghosts to rest i read somewhere that it helps you read my god harry i didntknow why you his hands dropped to her sides and he started tickling her ribs hermione squealed and began squirming in his lap harry harry s stop harry plead hermione plead for mercy she rolled off his lap onto the bed he lunged after her and found himself being tickled in return never hermione snape does not plead the tickle fight lasted a good ten minutes while the two ghosts looked on one seemed amused the other seemed angry how can she be doing that with him i ve only been dead a month oh stuff it snape cantyou see that she happy for the moment do you really begrudge her that no i just dontlike seeing her happy with potter he thought he stepped back and examined his emotions jealousy he noticed was predominant he had no desire for his wife to be with another man especially the boy who lived to be the bane of his existence harry potter why couldntshe fall for someone else even weasley would be better he frowned at the thought maybe not at least potter had a few active brain cells he truly had not known the boy was in love with her not consciously anyway honestly he had to admit dumbledore really buggered this one up potter would have followed hermione to the united states in order to be with her they could have been happy if it was not for the meddling old fool rose colored glasses the elder wizard should have known how he would react to coercion appealing to her gryffindor sense of heroism was the stupidest thing he had done since refusing to tell potter about the link with voldemort he looked up the giggling had stopped and it appeared the atmosphere had taken a severe change harry had hermione pinned to the bed where he had been tickling her but then their eyes met and his hands stilled they gazed at each other wide eyed and feeling a pull toward one another harry lowered his head to gently brush hermione lips with his her breath hitched but she did not pull away so he pressed her lips more firmly she sighed relaxing into the kiss as she felt loved for the first time in years his lips were soft and warm his kiss gentle and calm very characteristic of him in a flash she got a glimpse of how her life could be if she let him in and came to the realization it would not be bad at all where there could have been passion with severus there would be tenderness love instead of indifference support and encouragement but without the intellectualism snape provided but harry would be there for her as he always has been he would help her raise the baby and be a loving father husband friend and lover unfortunately it was too soon she gently pushed him away i sorry harry he smiled and gently kissed her forehead dontbe hermione i understand i i hope i didn t i mean it wasn t i m s shhhh dontbe sorry harry it just a little too soon for me i dontregret it it showed me that there is something else in my life besides grief he touched his cheek we can try again later i promise his eyes shown with love as he gazed down on her i will never pressure you hermione even if you re never ready for anything beyond what we have already i will always be there to take care of you when you need me thank you harry the two gryffindors sat up straightening their clothes i still think i won though harry gave his friend a mischievous wink hermione stuck her tongue out at him maybe we ll have to have a rematch sometime she looked at him seriously for a moment and then took his hand harry he looked at her curiously uh harry would you mind going to st mungo with me tomorrow i i d like someone to be there st mungo s is she ill sirius found it amusing to see snape worried that for me to know and you to find out snapey poo snape cut him a glare that is not amusing not for you maybe is she going to be alright what do i look like madam trelawney to you snape smirked now that you mention it bugger yourself snape you ll find out shortly he turned his attention back to his godson and his best friend who were wrapped in a tight hug i know it wontbe easy doing it all by myself i wish harry nodded you wish snape was here i know it only natural for you to want the man you loved to be with you at a time like this hermione looked stunned you knew it was pretty obvious hermione i could only dream that you would look at me the way you looked at him i sorry harry dont be i just sorry the bloody git couldntopen his eyes and see what was standing in front of him you deserved better harry i have loved you for a long time hermione and i will always be here for you never forget that i dontexpect you to love me but i hope you will not ask me to stop loving you she smiled as if i could make you do something you didntwant to do thank you harry anytime love just let me know okay time to move on before snape could react the scene suddenly faded into the horrifying reality of the gryffindor common room snape glared at sirius he blinked his eyes innocently what oh you find this disturbing i guess you should have thought about that before you went off and got yourself killed snape sighed i knew it i in hell he grimaced irritably at his unwanted companion what are we here for now black i figured this might give you some perspective in light of one of your earlier comments what the portrait swung open and hermione stepped through followed by her faithful bodyguards potter weasley and the weasley girl immediately walked over to the fireplace and sat down amongst the couches and chairs severus idly observed that they looked a lot more comfortable than the slytherin equivalents the students were still in their school uniforms so this obviously took place before he and hermione were married what did black want him to see ron looked at his best friend curiously what is it hermione what going on what did dumbledore have to say harry frowned why dontyou give her a chance to answer first ron oh sorry maybe you should tell us about the meeting first ginny suggested i imagine it was about the ministry contract with professor snape he d always admired the youngest weasley for having a mind and the will to use it i uh i not sure where to begin harry reached over and took her hand perhaps at the beginning she nodded briefly and began while she talked severus had been there after all he took careful note of the reactions of the four gryffindors hermione was very uncomfortable but who could blame her could anyone go through this and not be at least a small bit rattled the weasley girl seemed composed interested but sympathetic to her friend plight snape remembered that she and draco malfoy had been married shortly before the fight against voldemort and therefore were not subject to the law he d been afraid draco was merely doing it to hack off his father but the killing curse to the back was a rather vehement statement that he could care less what the elder malfoy thought or if he breathed for that matter even knowing that he had still been surprised when the youthful slytherin had joined the fight despite his objections the boy surprised them all potter expression made a lot more sense now that snape had confirmation that he was in love with hermione it was hopeless pained and angry with an undercurrent of total adoration and love in that moment he actually felt sorry for the boy he was trying to understand her decision but he could tell it was hard for the gryffindor to fathom the woman he loved was going to marry the great greasy git of hogwarts it was ironic that this boy saved the wizarding world only to lose the woman he loved thanks to the ministry of magic bloody bastards snape was surprised at how calmly her friends were taking the news especially potter the man who loved her was infamous for throwing temper tantrums when unfair things happened but now he was practicing restraint it was all for her he realized too bad not everyone in that room was so controlled weasley reaction more than made up for the lack of the others snape professor snape ron and yes bloody hell hermione what are you thinking it the best answer for both of us ron how can you say that dad says the united states is offering amnesty for anyone fleeing the marriage law you could escape and still be in the wizarding world yes ron i can move to america away from my family friends and the best wizarding college in the world i can give up my dream to become a hogwarts teacher and work on getting my mastery in potions and charms great idea i glad you thought of it what about harry ron harry hissed gesturing frantically hermione glanced at her dark haired best friend what do you mean harry appeared to be on the verge of panic er hermione he in love with you you bint hermione reared back as if slapped what ron not a word harry face was flushed with anger and embarrassment he stood up and dragged ron out of the room er ginny squirmed uncomfortably as her friend stared at her in shock did you know about this the quiet demand was almost inaudible uh well uh yes yes hermione eyes widened bloody hell why didntyou tell me ginny he asked me not to but why snape could see the tears glistening in her eyes he was going to tell you after graduation after graduation well after newts more accurately he didntwant you distracted in any way he knows how much they mean to you and then this bloody law happened and he decided to wait until you made your choice but i could have mione i hate to say this but i agree with your decision professor snape will make sure you re taken care of and given every opportunity to follow your dreams any other choice would have meant you would need to flee europe or give up your magic he would never want that for you harry would have followed you but we all know you both would have been unhappy leaving england at least now you ll be here and he can still have your friendship but i besides you said snape going to work to get the law overturned once that happens you and harry can pick up where you left off you dontunderstand ginny there not going to be an abolishment of the marriage law the statistics are true the ministry first and foremost duty is to preserve the wizarding world they cantget rid of the law until it produces enough children to infuse the gene pool with enough new blood to offset the inbreeding headmaster dumbledore let me look at the research ironically enough the way the ministry decided to go about revitalizing things is actually the quickest way to accomplish their goals it will only take one or two generations instead of five wait so you chose to stay with snape despite the fact that you ll be married to him forever what did you think i was going to abandon any children we had or expect them to live without a father but why not leave i dontwant to ginny i spent a lot of time and effort getting to where i am and i not prepared to give it up because the stupid ministry cantthink past their prejudices but hermione this is your life yes ginny it is severus will make sure i get the chance to do the things i want to and i can make sure he is free to live his life as he chooses within the dictates of the ministry law you think it would be better for us to be with complete strangers no i think you d be better off in america can you honestly say you wouldnthave as many choices there as you would here no i can t but america doesnthave the problem with prejudice against muggle born witches like we do if i can serve as an example maybe other witches will get more chances to follow their dreams oh dear god hermione you cantsave everyone but she can try harry sauntered down the stairs followed by a contrite ron h harry i he knelt in front of her i understand mione more than you think wha what do you mean i mean i know there more to it than what you re telling us ginny gazed at him in shock what do you mean harry he took hermione hand i mean that snape is far closer to hermione dream man than i will ever be he a bastard but he a brilliant bastard who can actually challenge her to think about what she talking about instead of a dolt needing a lesson to understand what she saying you re not a dolt harry maybe not but i know you need someone like that to be truly happy he gave her a wry smile someone less obsessed with quidditch perhaps and far more interested in books i think snape can give that to you he d be a fool not to see what a wonderful opportunity he been given besides he needs someone like you hermione blushed squeezing his hand i not sure that completely true harry but i guess it too late to find out now they all looked at the clock 12 07 a m her only choice now would be to flee you re right about snape hermione he will take care of you and make sure you can follow your dreams his family is very influential and you will probably have far greater opportunities because of it and just think you ll be living with the best potions master in europe the hurt in his eyes was apparent to everyone but they wisely chose to ignore it harry had no desire to make things harder on himself or hermione snape was shocked wait she knew the marriage law would never be overturned she an arithmancy whiz snape what do you think then why did she would you have listened to her if she told you her calculations indicated you were being a stubborn fool bloody mutt good point do you know ron weasley hasnttalked to her since graduation what why not he knows how much the entire marriage thing hurt harry and he never forgiven her for it mr weasley seems to be forgetting that if she had fled to america there would be an entire ocean between him and his two best friends but he thinks harry would be happy what do you think believe it or not snape i tend to agree with harry he d be a great husband dontget me wrong but there would always be something missing for her just like her disinterest in quidditch for him snape nodded that was one of the many ways potter and hermione never really fit so i hope you noticed she never made fun of you nor did harry or ron no mr weasley instead seemed to think being married to me is a fate worse than death well you pretty much proved him right now didntyou black sirius interrupted someday you re going to stop feeling sorry for yourself and realize people donthate you as much as you seem to want them to harry only real problem with you these days is how you treated your wife ron still a prat but the teachers here are friendly and supportive it too bad you didnthave the intelligence to comprehend the idea of friendship sod off black sirius smirked the truth hurts his head perked up as if he heard something it time for us to go now but you dontwant to miss this trust me with a wave of his wand they were gone shadowy vixen actually that wasnta mistake snape was in disbelief that the person he saw was sirius since he supposed to be dead so he automatically assumed it was harry playing a practical joke perhaps i should find a way to explain that better artemis virgin goddess i afraid snape did have to die for this story it will be explained better later however so please keep reading hopefully you will be pleased with the direction it goes thank you everyone for continuing to read i d like to take a moment of silence for our friends in london who have suffered terribly from the terrorist attacks st mungo is easily recognizable as the bastion of healing in the wizarding world the two men appeared in a hallway just in time to see harry potter and his best friend be led into a small room by a healer snape wondered what was going on he hoped hermione would be all right he followed sirius into the room and stood out of the way while hermione was ordered to lay on a bed with her hands at her sides the healer ran her wand over the length of his wife body several times making a note in a record book each time what is she doing asked snape worriedly sirius smirked patience grasshopper well mrs snape i have to say that you are doing extremely well although i concerned you seem a bit underfed have you been eating normal meals hermione looked contrite uh not really the healer frowned disapprovingly that is not acceptable mrs snape she pulled several potions out of a nearby cabinet and handed them to her take these one at each meal for a week should put you at a healthy weight and then you will need to take only the vitamin potion after that it is my understanding you are a potions mistress are you not not yet but i apprenticing under albus dumbledore for it good enough i will give you the recipes you will need to make your own potions do not deviate from the recipe at all it might be more efficient to use other ingredients but the ones listed are geared specifically to maintain the health of your baby you are three months along so the baby will be born approximately six months from now you ll need to have a checkup once a month to make sure things are progressing as they should snape was stunned baby sirius pushed him into a chair why did you think she wanted to discuss children snape she was trying to feel you out so she could break it to you gently you really buggered up that one shut it black i wait she was on muggle birth control which is only 96 effective if you didntwant kids you should have looked for a way to sterilize yourself or something i i going to be a father no snape you re not the blunt statement was a shock his head whipped around to glare at the animagus you re dead remember considering the things we ve been seeing i would speculate harry is actually going to be acting as a father to hermione child finally it all hit snape buried his face in his hands i it all my fault i treated her so badly for so long she felt afraid to tell me i was going to be a father how could she possibly fall in love with me beats me snape but i sure i can show you some good memories later there are a few you know would you like to know the gender the healer question brought snape attention back to the present uh hermione looked imploringly at harry i think it might be a good idea love that way we can buy you baby things that will not need to be transfigured or returned for exchange you re just curious he gave her an impish smirk well arentyou definitely i just dontknow if it s hermione there nothing wrong with finding out the gender of your child before she is born i seriously doubt she ll be offended she oh uh just hoping i guess mrs snape hermione looked at the mediwitch for a moment and then nodded mr potter instincts are correct mrs snape it is indeed a girl the two gryffindor faces broke out in a pair of brilliant smiles a girl you know i ve always wanted a girl to spoil said harry slyly hermione blushed uh we ll have to talk about that later harry i know love no rush she looked relieved thank you however that is not going to stop me from taking her beautiful mother out for dinner to celebrate he held out his hand assuming she will agree to accompany me of course it would be my pleasure mr potter then let us away mrs snape the two gryffindors left leaving the two ghosts behind snape looked incredulously after his wife unable to believe she was carrying his child despite how much he hated his parents it was actually a relief to know that the snape line would continue through his daughter tears welled in his eyes as he realized he would not be there to see her grow up i was such a fool was snape cut the other ghost a glare i failed to see what was in front of me for all this time three years i had everything a man could dream of and i wasted it on pointless anger and bitterness black how is it possible she loved me i know i failed to treat her as she deserved actually it my understanding you were pretty good for the first year i guess that trip to alexandria wasntthe best idea in the world no it was a good idea i just his gaze softened as he finally allowed himself to acknowledge what he d avoided for two years i realized during that trip i was in love with her somehow as hard as i tried she wormed her way into my heart and showed me that even i was capable of love he looked sharply at sirius i didntwant to face it i thought the ministry was going to overturn that stupid law very shortly and that she would gladly leave me when it happened i wasntabout to tell her i loved her and watch the pity in her eyes as she explained her lack of feelings for me you re right you were a fool he pulled out his wand come on you need to see something a flick of the wand found the two men standing in hermione bedroom sirius gestured for the potions master to come stand behind her desk to wait he was puzzled but curiosity kept his impatience in check it wasntlong before the door opened and hermione swept in tossing her books carelessly on the bed a quick call to the house elves produced enough tea and biscuits for the evening she threw herself into the chair at her desk and pulled out the worn leather book severus recognized as her journal sirius motioned for him to read over her shoulder well i guess it was inevitable six months living as the wife of severus snape has finally resulted in the one thing i alternately hoped and dreaded would happen that right i in love with him what am i going to do i know he doesntlove me i know he has no desire to he spending every free moment working to overturn that bloody law the last thing he would want is a tie to his unwanted child bride not that i a child or anything but he seems to still view me that way sometimes i tempted to start greeting him at the door naked just to illustrate the fact that i not his awkward and timid student merlin knows my body certainly isntchildlike but then he d have to actually look at me to see that augh i being uncharitable he really has been wonderful while it not as comfortable as it was while we were doing work for the order we ve still managed to develop a good working relationship i help him prepare for classes and he helps me with my studies my favorite time however is breakfast he insisted early on that we spend at least a short time together getting to know each other i dont think he meant it to last forever but he never said he wants to end it and i certainly not going to bring it up the conversations we have are wonderful laugh ron would be horrified at the idea the bloody git is still not talking to me at least harry understands that i really like having someone to talk to on the same level if not higher than me it not unspeakably arrogant to know i more intelligent than other people years of having to explain everything to ron harry and pretty much everyone around me taught me that one of my greatest pleasures these days is discussing a random topic and watching severus as he expounds upon it the only thing he really doesntknow a lot about is muggle society and culture i get the feeling it because he not really interested i imagine there was a reason he joined voldemort so i ve fallen in love with his incredible mind and despite all the cruel sarcasm and nastiness he really can be quite caring and wonderful see wedding entry for more information the way he treats me is with genuine kindness wrapped in the appearance of uncaring malice it like he cantlet himself appear to care despite the fact that he does i know maybe i reading too much into it if i am then i ve fallen in love with an ideal and it probably better that i never tell him i dontknow what to do there no way i telling harry about this it painful enough for him to see me married to another man the last thing he needs to hear is that i ve fallen for him ah well there not a lot i can do about it except hope one day my affections will be returned if i right about my arithmancy calculations the marriage law will not be overturned within the next five years knowing now what it feels like to love someone leads me to dread what it will feel like to know the feelings are unreturned i not ready to give up hope yet but we ll see how it goes hjs six months snape stared at the other wizard incredulously she was in love with me after only six months actually i think she was in love with you before that it just took her a while to realize it sirius gave a frustrated sigh severus get a clue she was already half in love with you by virtue of your time before your marriage respect admiration things that are often the basis for love were there long before you were married why do you think she chose you but remember what she said logically she knew you would care for her and would not stop her from pursuing her dreams you had an intellect she admired and felt the two of you could have a good long term relationship based on evidence of the past how was she supposed to know you would turn into a spoiled little prat after the ministry refused to rescind the law snape looked at the other ghost in disbelief but she wanted it repealed as much as i did when i told her about my hearing shortly after our first anniversary she was thrilled at the possibility they would finally overturn the bloody marriage law she went back to her room and cried because she thought you wanted nothing more than to be free of her coming after your trip that was a pretty harsh blow even malfoy thought you were a royal berk for that one how the bloody hell do you know all this black he tapped his head it all up here i ve been given the sum of your experiences so i can help you attain enlightenment snape glowered what if i dontwant it you wonder where ghosts come from what i was kidding about that i wasn t you have a lot of issues snape but many of them were resolved as a result of your death this is one that was made far worse because of it you have to deal with it to move on or you ll be stuck here forever severus felt a chill at the statement an eternity of watching his hermione fall madly in love with harry bloody potter no end to watching the two of them raise his daughter bloody hell alright black what do i need to see next what say we drop in on your wife and see how she doing they were standing in his and hermione chambers before he could react the door opened and she walked in still flush from the excitement of her appointment a glance at the clock told her she had a little over an hour before she had to meet harry at the school entrance good just enough time to ready for their date it was a date she realized harry had not said anything but his behaviour was far from casual she revised her plans to accommodate a nicer outfit walking past his bedroom was always difficult for her and this time she had minerva words echoing in her head she paused in the doorway gazing at the bed that had seen so much of her as of late during the three years of their marriage she had been in his bedchamber a total of four times she smiled fondly remembering the first time she had been there it was shortly after they returned from their amazing honeymoon the second was a year later after their return from alexandria both of them were riding high on the pleasure their trip brought and could barely keep their hands off each other he dragged her into his room and made passionate love to her all night long it was one of the most beautiful nights of her life he had to go and ruin it the next morning by giving her the cold shoulder bastard tonight was the first step toward a new phase in her relationship with harry they had both changed a great deal over the past three years and the months since severus death found them spending a great deal of time together it made her realize that perhaps they were ready to have the relationship they could have had without the marriage law they were very different then she honestly thought they would not have been compatible hindsight showed her they merely needed experience and maturity both of them were fairly volatile during that time and it probably would have destroyed their relationship severus could handle things with the wisdom of experience that would have driven harry away hermione needed time to get to know harry as a man rather than the boy she always badgered to do his homework he changed for the better in her opinion and that might make all the difference today the defeat of voldemort tempered him making him more thoughtful and introspective she supposed the difference had a lot to do with the absence of ron he had always influenced harry to be less responsible and more reckless than he ordinarily would have been the infamous weasley temperament affected harry in ways no one ever realized until ron was gone ron was keeper for the cannons right now and rarely visited either of his best friends his absence enabled harry to grow to be his own man a man who no longer felt the need to prove himself at every turn now when ron came to visit things were still friendly but a lot tamer they played quidditch and talked about girls occasionally going out for drinks hermione on the other hand had not seen ron in years he only visited harry but even that was a rare occurrence they had gone their separate ways and ron never looked back she married severus and went to college while harry came back to teach defense against the dark arts immediately after graduation the position had been left vacant after the death of the previous teacher in the war and even severus had to admit the boy who defeated voldemort was a more than adequate replacement the three years following her marriage to severus snape only served to deepen their friendship and make the two friends realize they had far more in common than they ever imagined harry was the only one who understood her odd muggle references and actually enjoyed getting out to visit london every once in a while while he had little interest in potions there were a number of charms he took great pleasure in talking with her about he reciprocated with his knowledge of magical defense and the dark arts she was his dueling partner and truly enjoyed the time they spent in the library reading about the latest innovations in defensive magic quidditch discussions became a thing of the past since harry could always talk to ginny draco or any of the weasleys about it he no longer felt the need to force the conversation on hermione and she no longer nagged him about getting things done they matured and it showed in the depth of their friendship but could it be more she thought so harry was attractive so that was a non issue in actuality she was afraid she was not good enough for him but he insisted he found her beautiful and she forced herself to believe him her eyes fell on the bed and she blushed as repressed images of her and harry surged to the surface for the first time she allowed herself the luxury of enjoying them she nodded she was attracted to harry both mentally and physically it would take effort but she had few doubts that the two of them could be happy together it was that thought which got her through picking out her dress a classic black sheath that fell to mid thigh accented with a rhinestone brooch at the cleft of the low neckline the soft velvet dress was dipped low in the back and she decided on a translucent silk scarf black as an accessory she arranged her hair in a french twist with delicate wisps of chocolate framing her face makeup had never been something she wore a lot of but the deep red lipstick and light shadow brought out her best features severus thought she looked beautiful as he watched her prepare for a date with another man potter no less he was struck in the heart at the realization he would never have the chance to see her this way again he had three years to take her on dates vacations and weekend getaways opportunities to explore the muggle world with her at his side and he wasted it in a fruitless pursuit of a cause no one truly wanted to champion even potter backed off after the first rejection black was silent for a change seemingly sensitive to his mood and oddly considerate of his feelings they merely watched in silence each wrapped in the thoughts of a future between the two best friends severus truly hoped they would be happy she deserved it after all he put her through she deserved a man who would worship her for the goddess she was he would give almost anything to be in his place to get a second chance hermione finished her preparations and grabbed her handbag and a light cloak with a final look at their chambers she gave a sigh and walked out ready to embrace her future i dontwant to watch them black so please do not subject me to that no problem snape even i not so cruel he tossed the former victim of his malice a grin well now that i dead i not they stood in silence for a few minutes before snape broke it with a question why did she love me how could she when i treated her with such indifference good question i guess it time to show you the good stuff follow me black headed to the door and walked through his very carriage daring snape to follow he did and found himself in grimmauld place black family residence it was disturbing to actually see the specters tied to each of the paintings disgusting isntit evil bastards never did want to move beyond their dark desires i hate it here more now than when i was alive why are we here then take a look hermione came skipping gleefully down the stairs garbed in jeans and a t shirt he recognized as one of her favorites ron stomped after her followed by a quieter harry do you mean you re going to be working with him hermione he treated you and every other person besides his precious slytherins like crap since we started at that school how can you waste your summer like this you it my summer ronald and i ll do with it what i want but snape he ll make your summer a living hell just like the school year she tossed him a grin well at least he canttake house points harry laughed she got a point ronald this is my chance to actually work with one of the best potions masters in europe how often does a student a full year shy of graduation get that opportunity there are hoards of people that would kill for a chance like this professor snape never takes apprentices this is the closest i will ever get and i ll be damned if i going to blow it off in favor of watching you play quidditch and exploding snap but hermione snape wondered why hermione did not hex him for being so whiney but hermione nothing i doing this ronald and nothing you say is going to stop me she whirled to face him know this ronald weasley if you do or say anything to jeopardize this opportunity i will make sure you will live to regret it for the rest of your life emasculation will be a picnic compared to what i will do to you if you screw this up for me stay away from the lab i have no doubt you are not welcome down there and i will not torment professor snape with your presence because you cantseem to leave me alone for five fucking minutes get a life ronald and stop trying to control mine you re not my keeper my father or my bloody master in an instant she had spun on her heel to continue down the stairs to the laboratory severus noticed harry grab ron as he moved to follow her and the two male gryffindors fled back to the comfort of the living room such that it was snape remembered this day hermione had come in to the lab with two minutes to spare looking flustered and angry he had considered asking her what was bothering her but he could not risk any sort of informality while he was a spy for dumbledore asking her to work with him was a risk by itself but there really was not anyone else available he trusted to help him research and prepare such a complex potion he had already come to admire her for her intellect by then as irritating as it was but it was that summer working with her and the subsequent months at hogwarts which gave him cause to admire her for herself she had matured over the years into a poised and confident young woman possessed of an incredible intellect and thirst for knowledge rivaling his own it was only logical that the two of them would bond one night after working for twelve hours on another dead end potion no longer the ultimate know it all who felt the need to endlessly spout fact after fact until blue in the face the adult hermione was a thoughtful woman who concentrated more on the quality of her words than the quantity the discussion began as an offshoot to their usual post failure analysis of the potion and expanded to encompass topics from potions to literature to music it began a pattern that lasted throughout the summer and into the school year during those months he learned she was far more complex than he ever imagined severus always thought of hermione as one third of the trio they were inseparable or so he thought and it was always frustrating for him to see her reduced to a sidekick seeing her on her own as her own woman gave him a completely different perspective she was the brains behind the brawn in the golden trio she was the voice of moderation amongst her peers and the one they came to with the problems they could not bring to the teachers she tutored advised and helped everyone she could and still managed a class load that would have reduced most students to tears he learned that the reason she was such an overachiever was to prove all those bigoted gits wrong about muggle born she was tired of being judged for the blood in her veins and was determined to force them to look at the brains in her head he finally understood where she was coming from and could not help but be impressed her brains were definitely something to be admired the knowledge she possessed was not just a random collection of facts to be parroted back for points she had a genuine understanding of the topics she studied which was pretty much everything and a very penetrating intellect capable of identifying the strengths and weaknesses of any argument in many ways she reminded him of himself as a youth only without the prejudice towering resentment and social inadequacies that drove him to become a death eater their talks became the highlight of his day when she came to him with the story of harry prophecy his first reaction was to be angry with dumbledore for not telling him the second was a determination to help her find the spell she was looking for in order to save potter he had failed to save the boy parents he was not going to fail to save him working together they managed to accomplish the impossible and it was a relief to see the results in action after the death of voldemort and his exoneration he honestly expected to settle down to enjoy a nice quiet life of teaching and researching the marriage law came as a very unwelcome interruption to his plans and he wound up taking out his frustration on the one woman who managed to catch his interest had she been ten years older or he ten years younger he would have asked for permission to court her but while their age difference really wasntan issue in the wizarding world a twenty year difference meant very little when compared to life spans averaging over 100 years their stage of life was he could not bring himself to letch over a girl twenty years his junior who had just completed schooling with him perhaps in a few years he would have taken the chance after she explored a bit and became worldlier but the bloody marriage law changed all that she was forced into a marriage with her former professor who had just spent seven years belittling her and doing everything in his power to push her away she deserved better his anger stemmed more from what she lost than what they forced him into he had always figured he would marry some bint he had no interest in have an heir and then set mother of his child free with a large bribe to leave him alone hermione was not someone he could do that with he could have been happy with her but he could not get over the idea that she deserved the chance to determine her own fate she was far too young to be forced into something like marriage and he was far too old to be the one she married he hated the law but as black pointed out he acted like he hated her he was an idiot earth to snape come in snape what the bloody hell do you want black severus was still staring at the door long after his wife left for her date well i thought you wanted to see some positive stuff if you d like to keep gathering fluff however be my guest snape speared him with a glare get on with it i thought you d never ask okay you should recognize this day you just may not know everything that happened black moved his wand and the scene shifted oh yes he recognized it it was their wedding day severus and sirius appeared in the transfiguration classroom it had been transformed into a dress parlor where several women gathered around a vision in white minerva was there along with ginny weasley hermione the vision lavender brown and a woman he recognized as hermione mother mrs granger was dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief as the two girls worked their magic on her daughter hermione was blushing as lavender fastened her garters and ginny helped her with the chemise it was ivory silk he remembered made by minerva upon the birth of her one and only daughter gold braiding adorned the sleeves neckline and hem accented by splashes of crimson and black heavy robes the color of champagne went over the gown a golden brooch in the shape of the gryffindor lion was placed at chest level holding the robes modestly closed gold piping lined the edges and celtic patterns were sewn around the high collar sleeves and hem it was amazing and incredibly suited to his young bride the ensemble had been intended for minerva daughter when she got married the woman had been tragically killed in the first war and minerva could never bring herself to get rid of it hermione had been like a daughter to her so she offered to let the young gryffindor wear the robes for her wedding he could see tears in the transfiguration professor eyes as she watched hermione was indescribably beautiful he had thought so that day but could never really remember it after the fact the day was such a blur he watched as the brown and weasley girls twisted her hair up into an intricate chignon that left a waterfall of curls down her back and a few chestnut tendrils framing her face it was secured with a single pin which he recalled had been charmed to release the tawny locks upon their return to his room her hair fell in waves around her face and he remembered spending a considerable amount of time running his hands through it soothing her her mother gave her an amber pendant to wear to match the bracelet she had gotten for her sixteenth birthday when they were done minerva gestured and a desk transformed into a three part mirror that allowed hermione to see herself from several angles she seemed shocked you look beautiful my dear severus will not know what hit him hermione gave her a shy smile thank you professor the dress is perfect hermione you look incredible ginny was virtually gushing with enthusiasm the youthful bride squirmed nervously thinking about the day and night awaiting her perhaps hermione would like a few moments alone with her mother minerva always had been very perceptive she glanced gratefully at her former transfiguration professor come girls we should make sure filius is not getting too carried away with the decorations the three grabbed their dress robes and headed out the door we ll see you outside the great hall in ten minutes my dear thank you professor it minerva my dear and you re welcome the door closed leaving hermione alone with her mother the older woman came over and gave her daughter a big hug oh my darling i always knew this day would come i just didnt expect it this soon me neither mum i honestly figured i would at least be done with university mrs granger motioned for her daughter to sit with her why are you going through with this then you could always come home you know we ll take care of you you d have to go to a muggle university but i cantleave the wizarding world mum not now i too much a part of it i like being a witch doing magic i good at it darling you ve always been good at anything you put your mind to but i do understand why not move to america then you d be free we could always come visit hermione shook her head i will not run away from this i ve worked too hard to establish my place here i not giving it up just because some idiot minister of magic cantcome up with a better plan to help fix this problem then there truly is an issue with children i afraid so it like the english royal family there are a limited number of pure blood families in england they ve been so obsessed with purity and status they ve bred themselves into a corner they re all pretty much related now far too closely and the inbreeding has resulted in many stillbirths and squibs squibs people born of wizards but have no magic ah so their solution is to force them to marry those they consider beneath them her mother always had been very perceptive that why the issue is being forced headmaster dumbledore says that the only way they could actually enforce something like this was to include everyone the only way to keep it honest was to match up couples themselves and this severus snape was the person they chose for you he twenty years older than you that not so much as you think mum wizards typically live to see 100 years old a twenty year age difference is not uncommon but you ve not had the chance to be with other people they re expecting you to give up a very important experience of your young life just so you can be a hero again haventyou done enough i mum i dontthink the ministry feels they can favor the few of us responsible for defeating voldemort if they did harry harry would be able to be with the woman he wants you hermione looked surprised give your old mum some credit my dear i saw how he looked at you last summer i honestly surprised the two of you never dated he wouldnthave risked me like that mum voldemort would have done anything to get me if he d know how harry felt about me so he finally told you sort of it was more like ron blurted it out while he freaked about me choosing to marry severus so how do you feel about him darling i it complicated mum severus has lived a very difficult life and it hardened him he angry bitter and has so much hatred for himself and the choices he made in his youth but underneath that there is a brilliant honorable noble man who i think could very easily be the man i always dreamed of i care for harry mum but he will never be able to match me in the ways i feel are important i ve always known you would need to find someone as intelligent as you why do you think your father and me tried so hard to set you up with allison son he brilliant like you and and annoying arrogant stuck up with a healthy dose of chauvinism tossed in for fun he would come to hate me because of my intellect mum he has to be the best he has to lord it over everyone he can that date we went on was a fiasco i almost hexed his balls off when he told me i was pretty enough to be seen with him and that i did not seem to be the embarrassing sort oh dear he told his mother you got along famously that not surprising i doubt he would admit i told him he was an annoying prat who could bugger himself before i let him kiss me mrs granger laughed that is very probable darling he always been the prideful sort she turned serious so what about this fianc e of yours are you marrying him out of pity snape narrowed his eyes to focus on his wife answer he had always wondered about this no mum i not if there is one person in this world i could never pity it would be severus snape he the most self aware person i ve ever met do you know he just spent almost two decades working to make up for the mistakes of his youth he did everything in his power to help us get rid of voldemort and the entire time he was doing penance for his past he always been unapologetic about the way he treated his students knowing that his methods were teaching us to pay attention and be careful in what we were doing he chose to be unpleasant and snide making sure no one got close enough to be at risk from voldemort he was surprised she recognized that he one of the greatest potions masters in the world and is completely aware of it to the point of reveling in his status he is frighteningly wealthy influential and the head of his family he too proud to pity too amazing to despise i really do like him and i think we will be good together she shrugged besides i would hate for him to be force to marry some mindless bint as a result of the ministry stupidity he suffered enough do you love him hermione was quiet for a moment no mum not yet she looked into the older woman eyes i think i can but we need more time to be together to get to know each other as something other than professor and student i honestly thought about possibly asking him out on a date after i d been at university for a year or so if he was still single i can honestly say i attracted to him snape was shocked he never knew his wife had been interested in him before their marriage i glad to hear it i would hate for you to go into an arranged marriage without some form of interest in your future spouse does he feel the same way if only she knew i doubt it i hope he will someday if he doesn t he a fool i wish you good luck darling i know you ve thought this through and while i not sure this is the wisest course i will support you she hugged her daughter tightly you have my and your father blessing hermione while i will admit we do not completely understand this decision of yours we know you thought it out before making it we trust your judgment make sure your new husband understands he is welcome in our house and we are pleased to have him as part of the family i hope the two of you will be happy thanks mum i love you so much i love you darling she stood up let not keep that handsome fianc e of yours waiting snape stared at his mother in law disbelievingly handsome unbelievable isntit she is a muggle though black you are a hypocrite being a muggle does not automatically make her inferiour then why is it you never went with your wife to visit them i never thought they would want me to come even though hermione told you what they said i thought they were being polite even my parents would have invited hermione to visit and you know how they felt about muggle born what mudblood too difficult to say now that your wife canthear you fuck off black he smirked so shall we go watch the best day of your life severus was already walking toward the door there was no way he was going to miss this opportunity the wedding had been a blur to him the first time this was a chance to finally appreciate it the great hall was decorated like a mystical fairyland he d forgotten how excited flitwick had gotten about the wedding the diminutive professor took over the decorating from dumbledore preferring to make sure his favorite student wedding day was as special as he could make it silver and gold candles floated overhead filling the room with a soft golden light the image of the sky above it was star filled and clear with a small sliver of moon adding a silvery glow the floor had been enchanted to appear as marble gold and silver veins sparkling in the flickering light a dark blue carpet ran the length of the hall ending just before the head table where white linens shimmering china and flawless crystal were spread in preparation for the reception snape found himself amused at the positioning of a slytherin and gryffindor banner at the front of the room dumbledore had been so thrilled at the idea of the two houses intermarrying especially since it was between two people that truly exemplified the house principles the elderly wizard stood at the end of the runner gleefully awaiting the entrance of the bride his robes were unusually subdued dark blue with silvery stars and moon scattered throughout the velvety fabric the dark color of his matching hat lent a formality to his presence rarely seen outside the wizengamot severus figured much of that was meant to intimidate the small fussy man sent by the ministry to witness the ceremony not very many people had been invited to the binding itself the weasleys made up a good portion of the guests gathered in an orange cluster near the front of the room potter dark head was located nearby a single shock of red hair could be seen in the back ron weasley he was surprised the boy had been so unsupportive of his friend no wonder she d refused to speak of him hermione parents were closest to where the couple would stand followed by minerva mcgonagall and one of his very distant cousins all the surviving sixth and seventh year gryffindors were in attendance as was the ravenclaw girl lovegood and several other students from that house draco malfoy was the only slytherin beside himself in attendance he could see most of the order was there as were all the hogwarts teachers trelawney seemed rather subdued he imagined his threat to skin her alive if she disrupted the ceremony or reception gave her visions too horrifying to contemplate he smirked at the thought by the time the two ghosts had positioned themselves at the front of the hall the music had begun and the tall doors opened to reveal a smiling ginny in dark blue dress robes she walked a few steps before hermione a herald to the bride as it were the woman in question stepped forward and it was like time stopped she was radiant garbed in her wedding robes with a demure veil over her face and crowned with a wreath of ivory and gold flowers she was the epitome of loveliness his heart had almost stopped that day upon seeing her and his first thought was that maybe the marriage law wasntsuch a bad thing even three years later he couldnt help but be struck breathless by her beauty her stately advance gave him enough time to drink his fill of her but with the divided perception of the day he knew it had seemed like mere moments he d been grateful for the support of his godson who stood with him for the ceremony hermione stepped forward to stand at his side and they turned to face dumbledore he began we have come together here in celebration of the joining together of hermione jane granger and severus salazar snape the law of life is love unto all beings without love life is nothing without love death has no redemption love is the essence of life antithesis to death embodiment of creation and the vitality of spirit if we learn no more in life let this be so marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection as with any aspect of life it has its cycles its ups and downs its trials and triumphs with full understanding of this severus and hermione have come here today to be joined as one in marriage as in the times of past i ask at this time who gives the bride in marriage jonathan granger stepped forward with his wife her mother elizabeth and i do upon this eve of a new life it must be known that hermione is neither property to be bought and sold given and taken nor is she a child to be commanded as a woman i ask if she comes here of her own free will and if she has taken her family blessings hermione is it true that you come of your own free will and accord yes it is true with whom do you come and whose blessings accompany you i come with my father and mother and am accompanied by all of my family and friend blessings please join hands with your betrothed and listen to what which i am about to say hermione nervously took his hand above you are the stars below you are the stones as time doth pass remember like a stone should your love be firm like a star should your love be constant let the powers of the mind and of intellect guide you in your marriage let the strength of your dedication make you inseparable be close but not too close possess one another yet be understanding have patience with one another for storms will come but they pass quickly be free in giving affection and warmth have no fear and let not the ways of the others give you unease for your loved ones are with you always the elderly wizard turned his gaze to ginny have you the rings she nodded dropping them into his outstretched hand the circle is a perfect figure without beginning without end with no area of weakness it is a symbol of the cycle of life of birth death and rebirth this shall serve as a physical reminder of your vow and that all things begin and end and begin again these rings a token of love for each other shall serve to remind you that life goes on that these moments pass when you are engulfed in anger or in sadness look to your hand and remember that the wheel turns forever onward and it is love that turns the wheel he held up his hand may the element of air bless these rings air is at the beginning of all things the direction of east and the dawning of a new day may your lives through the reminder of this ring be blessed with continuing renewal of love he gestured and a cool breeze swept through the room leaving the rings sparkling in its wake may the element of fire bless these rings fire is the passion within your love the spark of love itself the heat of anger and the warmth of compassion it is the direction of south the heat of midday may your lives through the reminder of this ring be blessed with continual warmth another gesture and fire burst from his hand to imbue the rings with a soft golden glow may the element of water bless these rings water nourishes and replenishes us the waters of emotion and harmony pour vitality into our lives it is the direction of west the afternoon and evening may your lives through the reminder of this ring be blessed with fulfillment and contentment he waved his hand and a gentle rain fell from nowhere onto the rings they absorbed the water taking on a bluish tinge finally dumbledore touched the rings with a small stone he took from his pocket severus knew it was part of the stone merlin had enchanted to hold excalibur over a thousand years ago they shimmered slightly after the contact may the element of earth bless these rings all life springs from the earth and returns to the earth the direction of north the nighttime may your lives through the reminder of this ring be blessed with strength and solidity he was suddenly surrounded by an aura of power by air fire water and earth do i bless these rings may the elements of life bless your union with happiness wholeness and love the aura of power faded as dumbledore turned his attention to severus and held out his hand where the rings sparkled in the dim light he remembered the piercing stare as if it were yesterday he always thought the old wizard was trying to tell him something now he understood severus i have not the right to bind you to hermione only you have this right if it be your wish say so at this time and place your ring in her hand knowing he had no choice he took the ring it is my wish hermione if it be your wish for severus to be bound to you place the ring on his finger and speak the words in your heart she looked directly at him as she slowly slid the ring on to the fourth finger of his left hand there was a question and a challenge in her eyes he gave her a slight nod her soft voice carried to all corners of the room he remembered being surprised at her speech i give you this ring as a symbol of my love and my promise i promise to be your life mate and truest friend i will encourage you to be audacious and will help you when you dare to aim for your heart desire i will stand with you in being true to yourself i will sit with you in your pain and dance with you in your joy i will work with you to increase life beauty but i will not shrink away from its trials i will stand with you in the center of the fire i will make each new day an occasion to express my love for you i will share with you all of the adventure of being alive as you walk your path in life i ask that you walk beside me three years later he finally realized she had meant every word hermione i have not the right to bind you to severus only you have this right if it is your wish say so at this time and place your ring in his hand she nodded giving the ring to her fianc e it is my wish severus if it be your wish for hermione to be bound to you place the ring on her finger and speak the words in your heart he quirked his eyebrow in query gently sliding the ring home after her nod his silky voice murmured the words he never expected to say i give you this ring as a symbol of my love and my promise i hold your promise and your invitation at the center of my heart and shall always be sustained by your light and by your beauty i give to you my soul and my dreams as my promise for my love and devotion to you is without limit as you walk your path in life i ask that you walk beside me it was with a start that he realized he meant everything he said that day too nice speech shut it black on your hand you now wear a ring the circlet symbolizing the wheel of life that turns ever onward there is a lesson in both the hand and the wedding ring the ring is worn on the fourth finger in numerology the number four stands for steadiness and endurance the circle itself is all encompassing and inclusive your hand opens to receive and to give clenches in frustration and anger holds and soothes in times of sadness and clutches in fear with this hand are cities and sand castles made music played and poetry written into these hands is life given and from these hands is it taken all the actions of your hand move in sympathetic rhythm with the wheel of life and with your destiny pleasure pain creation destruction giving and receiving are all within the power of your hand as the ring symbolizes the cycle so does the hand symbolize the power of actualization and creation let this ring remind you of the many turns of the wheel through which you and your love shall pass and may everything that is touched by your hand be touched also by love speak now the vows of your binding severus took a deep breath and looked at the woman who would soon be his wife there were worse fates he thought and had a vision of a happy future with her at his side he smiled slightly as he spoke i severus salazar snapein the name of the spirits of earth that reside within all of us by the life that courses within my blood and the love that resides within my heart take you hermione jane granger to my hand my heart and my spirit to be my chosen one to desire you and be desired by you to possess you without shame for naught can exist in the purity of my love for you i promise to love you wholly and completely without restraint in sickness and in health in plenty and in poverty in life and beyond where we shall meet remember and love and love again i shall not seek to change you in any way i shall respect you your beliefs your family and friends and your ways as i respect myself nor shall i ever seek to cause you harm hermione i hermione jane grangerin the name of the spirits of earth that reside within us all by the life that courses within my heart take you severus salazar snape to my hand my heart and my spirit to be my chosen to desire and be desired by you to possess you and be possessed by you without shame or guilt for naught can exist in the purity of my love for you i promise to love you wholly and completely without restraint in sickness and in health in plenty and in poverty in life and beyond where we shall meet remember and love and love again i shall not seek to change you in any way i shall respect you your beliefs your family and friends and your ways as i respect myself nor shall i ever seek to cause you harm her eyes sparkled with joy as she completed her vow please join hands dumbledore held out a hand to draco for the binding cord the couple joined hands right to right left to left creating the symbol of eternity he raised the cord here before witnesses in perfect love and perfect trust hermione jane granger and severus salazar snape have swore their vows to each other with this cord i bind them to the vows they have made the cord was a triple braided rope with the three colors they chose to symbolize their hopes for their marriage the red was for courage strength and passion something his young bride possessed in abundance and he hoped he could learn for her sake light blue was for the understanding and patience they both knew they would need for the marriage to succeed white was suggested by minerva to symbolize peace sincerity and devotion each of their friends and family had taken a turn weaving the colors together as part of the preparations for the ceremony from his position in the afterworld severus could see the warmth and caring they d put into it dumbledore continued woven into this cord imbued into its very fibers are all the hopes of your friends and family and of yourselves for your new life together with the fashioning of this knot do i tie all the desires dreams love and happiness wished here in this place to your lives for as long as love shall last he tied the knot two entwined in love bound by commitment and fear sadness and joy by hardship and victory anger and reconciliation all of which brings strength to this union hold tight to one another through both good times and bad and watch as your strength grows a silvery light flashed along the length of the cord as the headmaster completed the final knot heart to heart soul to soul love binds and blends us all blue eyes twinkling with joy the headmaster placed his hand upon theirs and gave his final benediction by the winds that bring change by the fire of love by the seas of fortune and the strength of the earth do i bless this union he beamed as hermione and severus looked lovingly into each other eyes in the binding of yourselves have you created life anew step forth therefore into that new life and rejoice in your love he turned the couple to face the guests by the power vested in me by the powers above and the ministry of magic i now pronounce you husband and wife may your love so endure that its flame remains a guiding light unto you severus you may kiss your bride he d been shocked at that little addition of the headmaster s but he refused to turn coward in front of potter and the weasleys snape watched as he tentatively leaned forward and caught his wife lips in a gentle kiss she stepped forward and the kiss grew deeper and more passionate he remembered feeling a spark like nothing he d imagined at that first touch of his lips to hers they were petal soft and warm and very welcoming when she stepped closer their lips had pressed together causing a wave of desire to surge through him he tentatively touched his tongue to her lips and to his surprise she opened to him allowing him to deepen the kiss he could feel his reaction to her straining against his breeches it was that which caused him to break away breathless and flushed he saw her eyes sparkling with her emotions caring and something deeper draco malfoy whooped and started applauding his godfather the other guests joined in even harry and hermione father and the couple was quickly surrounded by their guests congratulating them on their marriage severus watched with amusement as he struggled to tolerate the overt friendliness of his new wife friends and family they d been pretty boisterous but he fumbled through and managed to not embarrass himself it was with great relief that they d retreated to the head table for the reception nice ceremony i have to wonder about those vows though why did you say all that it what i felt at the time black even then you loved her it was new but he thought about it i suppose in a way i did i had no idea though i honestly didntremember what i said to her she did of that i have no doubt he sighed it was all so overwhelming black i went from being attracted to one of my students yet expecting nothing would ever happen and never imagining i would marry someone i could stand to having to marry that same student in a wizard binding designed to last a lifetime maybe that was a hint what do you mean you think the wizengamot would have required the binding if they intended to allow the marriage act to be rescinded you know how difficult it is to perform an unbinding i know i wasntthinking straight yeah for three years there no need to belabor it black i know i made a mistake okay many mistakes there is nothing i can do about it now true you understand how she felt about you from the beginning he gazed lovingly at his wife now i do good then it time to move on what he panicked at the thought of never seeing his beloved hermione again dont worry snape we re not to that moving on yet i ve still got a few things to show you you said you wanted to know why she loved you right yes let go wow i can honestly say i extremely surprised at the generosity of your comments thank you so much for reading and being so incredibly supportive now i do have to say that this rate of updating is going to be a bit unusual i still working on the next two chapters of the story but i hoping to put something out once a week i working on a much larger fic as my primary goal at the moment and hope to have part one out in the next few months i donthave nearly as much time as i used to this story is probably going to be around 10 12 chapters i have a third fic hp hg that i hope to complete in my spare time while i trying to brainstorm for the big one knowing me hbp will probably inspire me to write something else but if not once i finish the fics i have started it ll be time to start working in earnest toward that great american novel goal thank you guys again and if you have any suggestions on how i can improve my writing please suggest away and now on to the story they appeared in the potions lab where a cauldron suspended over a low flame held a softly burbling iridescent white elixir he didnt recognize the potion immediately which clued him in to the time it had to be sometime during hermione second year of university she d spent most of the year working on her graduation project and many of the combinations she tried resulted in the strangest things he still had a sample of each of them with the methodology of their making documented in his lab he d always intended to do tests in order to find if any of them could be used for something the door burst open and hermione ran in dropping her books as soon as she entered the room she took a quick assessment of the potion in question and then quickly pulled a moonflower out of her stores and diced it he always admired her efficiency and accuracy in preparing ingredients her cuts were precise quickly reducing the flower to the proper consistency for use a ding echoed through the room and she swiftly added the new ingredient stirring the mixture with measured strokes twelve clockwise turns later she stepped back to watch the potion change a huge puff of smoke was suddenly expelled and the potion turned a sickly green color bloody fucking hell she slammed the vial on the counter it wasnt the first time he was thankful his vials were unbreakable something wrong my dear his own deep velvety tones cut through the silence hermione looked up to see her husband stroll into the room he curiously looked over the failed potion as his wife paced the room augh i never going to get this to work i never going to complete my potion i going to fail severus i never going to graduate hermione he crossed over to her and pulled her into his arms hermione listen to me sometimes we have to fail a hundred times before finally stumbling across the right combination of ingredients you will find the answer you just need to calm yourself and think gently stroking her hair he willed his wife to reign in her temper she stiffened momentarily ready to pull away she knew however that he was right and with that thought allowed herself to relax into his embrace they stood there for some time each enjoying the unusual contact several calming breaths later found her ready to go over her notes to try and figure out what went wrong she smiled up at him gratefully now is it safe to assume the potion was going well before today yes the base turned out fine and responded to all my tests the way it was supposed to what happened today this morning i added an infusion of ground ashwinder scales and dried amaranth stirring 21 times clockwise followed by 7 counterclockwise the potion turned from the grey base to the white i predicted i set the timer for six hours where i was due to add the diced moonflower she frowned it was supposed to turn yellow did you clean off the roots she glared of course i did with spring water like you taught us in our first year you diced as opposed to chopping the flower yes you used the whole flower yes why my studies showed that the whole flower was needed to gain the full benefits of the regenerating properties and before you ask i picked it at night under the full moon and dried it in sunlight for 7 days he nodded i figured as much what did you use to make the infusion spring water ground ashwinder scales and dried amaranth what did you use to stir it with a glass rod did you use the same rod when you added the moonflower of course not i her eyes widened that it she whispered severus you re a bloody genius throwing herself into his arms she kissed him on the lips and danced away frantically looking through her cabinets holly holly it neutral but made of natural materials that got to be it he stared at her stunned he hadntexpected her to react like that to kiss him he brought his hand up to his mouth in disbelief severus remembered that day well it was the first time hermione had allowed herself to be impulsive around him he knew what was wrong as soon as she told him about the infusion he couldnttell her though he was acting as her advisor he found it odd no one suggested alternative materials for her stirring sticks before but in retrospect he should have expected the university would not emphasize that most potions did quite well with the neutral properties of glass rods but moonflower required a natural connection to activate its properties especially when prepared the old way he watched his wife prepare another cauldron while his previous self saved the ruined potion for later study he hadnttaken the opportunity to watch her then but now he was free to do so he couldnthelp but admire the smooth grace with which she prepared the ingredients and added them to the steaming cauldron she d been a natural in his class in every class but divination if one were truthful and he d come to admire her skills during her seventh year and the summer before while they worked on the potion to destroy voldemort it had not surprised him that she chose potions one of her areas of study but he hadntexpected her to go for alchemy he d considered it in the past but charms had never been his best subject he was a natural at potions but his innate understanding of magic lent itself more to the hexes and countercurses used in defending against the dark arts a short while later she was finished preparing the base potion now all it had to do was simmer for six hours hermione headed over to her desk to begin working through a mountain of paperwork but she never got there the severus snape of a year ago stopped her with a gentle hand on her arm i think perhaps you should take a break now hermione but i have a lot of work that will be there when you come back in six hours it can wait you need to relax for a time she made a face you sound like harry and ron please he said his voice pained do me the favor of never comparing me to those two dunderheads ever again dont act like them then hermione i am simply trying to help you avoid some of my greater mistakes from when i was your age you are too young to give up the pleasures of life for work okay so what do you suggest he glanced at the clock perhaps you might join me for lunch i believe i can persuade dobby to prepare a picnic lunch for us and we can eat outside by the lake i know of a clearing where we will remain undisturbed her eyes widened in surprise a picnic who are you and what have you done with my husband he smirked even i cannot abide the dungeons all the time hermione being outside will help both of us relax and will help revitalize you for the rest of the day perhaps we might take some time to chat i d like that her shy smile tugged at his heart in a trice they were outside the school ensconced in a small glade near the lake it was a beautiful day clear sky sparkling lake and was cool with a hint of spring freshness as soon as they got outside severus knew it had been a good idea hermione relaxed noticeably her eyes becoming vibrant and full of life it struck him again that he loved her but like the fool he was he pushed it aside refusing to see what was before him with the wisdom of life beyond death he finally saw how she looked at him the love in her eyes was visible to anyone with half a brain how had he missed it he knew the primary reason for her joy on this day was not the potion as he originally thought but the fact that her husband was showing her genuine affection he d enjoyed it too they both needed to relax and being in each other presence did a great deal to accomplish that what happened afterward certainly helped them as well the two lovers stayed outside and chatted for the full duration of the six hours before she had to add the next ingredient it was one of the best days of his life and he smiled fondly in remembrance why had he screwed it up i wondered that as well he d forgotten about black you can read my mind too is there no end to the indignity of the afterlife oh stifle it snape it not like you re being really ambiguous in your thoughts i bet anyone knowing what i do would see that you regretted the stupidity you practiced for three years two we were getting to know each other for the first year oh so sorry merlin forbid i not credit you for time served black so tell me why did you seduce her later that evening after she added the ingredient to her potion i wanted to she was so beautiful and we d just spent a wonderful afternoon talking and enjoying each other company i didnt want to be apart from her that night i you took her to your bed but you couldntlet her stay the next morning i didntwant her to wake up and be disgusted it was one of our conjugal days you know i thought she would remember and hate me for taking advantage of it it was better than treating her like a whore indeed it was he looked at sirius you know i didntrealize how she felt about what i was doing i had no idea she felt like that i was using her for sex so you kicked her out of your room after seducing her oh that made lots of sense what the bloody fuck do you expect black it not like i come from a family with a lot of examples of affection i had no idea she would feel the way she did i was treating her like i saw my parents behave and that didntclue you in that it was wrong look at you snape look at how you turned out you became a bloody death eater for merlin sake you wanted control power influence and ultimately the ability to choose the woman you wanted you wanted what she could have given you so bad you could taste it the sad thing is that you had it but you still retreated back into the comfortable winter of your impersonal childhood dont you think i know that bloody hell black dontyou think i realized how badly i screwed things up as soon as i saw my wife weeping on my bed because of my death i hate what i did to her i hate every instant i failed to show her how much i loved her she going to be with someone else love someone else and raise my daughter with someone else all because i allowed my stupid pride to hold me back from telling her how i felt his shoulders slumped in defeat how can you think i dontknow what it has cost me she will always love you severus never forget that how do you know he asked brokenly come with me hermione was kneeling in front of a simple marble headstone in the graveyard behind hogwarts teachers who requested it were buried there and as the school had been more of a home to him than snape manor ever was he d made sure dumbledore knew his wishes as he looked over his wife he could see the gentle swell of her stomach now and it was not hard to conclude some time had passed since the last time he saw her preparing for her date with harry hello love well it been a busy day professor flitwick and i have spent most of it enlarging our quarters in the dungeons and making things ready for the baby albus retrieved a beautiful cradle from the manor and minerva brought me a huge pile of blankets and clothes i guess a wedding dress is not all she wanted to share with me she been like a second mother and i so glad she was here to help me through losing you oh god severus i miss you so much i know harry and i are getting closer he kissed me last night and for the first time i felt like being with him was the right thing for me to do he loves me he has since our sixth year he going to make sure the baby and me are taken care of i hope you dontmind i know the two of you didntget along but he really is wonderful and it wonttake much more for me to fall in love with him she chuckled i suppose that not something you really want to hear although maybe you ll be happy that i no longer mooning over you she was silent for a few moments i know how you felt about having children severus and several people have suggested i let everyone think my daughter is harry s he felt a pain at that but i not going to i ve never been ashamed of marrying you and the only reason i regretted it was because you hated it so much despite everything i loved you i still love you i canthelp but wish you were still here to see her i think you might have come to love her as much as i do i going to tell her about you you know the real you not the man everyone thinks you were she going to know her father was a brilliant snarky bastard who did incredibly dangerous and heroic things so the world would be a better place for us all she will know how much i love you and that i always will she spoke for some time pouring her heart out to the spirit of the man she loved with all her being she had no idea he was actually listening but she hoped he might somehow hear what she said and find comfort in it she even talked about the past and how she felt about him before their marriage i had a crush on you you know it started during my sixth year but didntreally get serious until the summer afterward working with you was the last thing i needed while i was trying to get you out of my head your voice sent chills through me every time i heard it and it was all i could do not to drool in class then i got to spend the summer watching you prepare potions and helping you all i could think about was how beautiful your hands were and how i wondered what they would feel like on my body i know i know i was a student but i was a horny student with a huge crush on my professor i so glad i never got detention with you he flushed at the thought he noticed that year that she d grown up and it was only years of iron discipline that kept him from feeling an attraction for her she was a student therefore off limits but he had few doubts that after she graduated he would have been overcome by his feelings for her he always dreaded that day for he knew it would be prelude to a broken heart the summer we worked together made me realize you were far more than just a handsome man with great hands and an amazing voice it was your intellect that attracted me more than anything and after a summer of working with you debating with you and talking about any topic under the sun i came to realize my crush was not going to go away easily i pushed it to the back of my mind so i wouldntreveal my feelings the marriage law was both a dream and a nightmare come true i never wanted you to be coerced into being with me i d honestly hoped to run into you maybe a year after i graduated and see if there might be something between us i always had these images of me haunting the local herbal shop or bookstore and then striking up a conversation with you oh you would have been snarky yet polite and i would have invited you to get a drink at the hog head maybe we could chat about old times catch up on what we were doing and maybe i could get you to agree to go out to dinner she sighed i know that scenario was highly fantastical and unlikely but i had to have something to dream about he was shocked he never knew she felt this way i know what you would be telling me now i would have gone away and found someone else to turn my attentions to true but i doubt it no one could live up to the standards you created simply by being yourself you raised the bar on what i wanted in a man without even knowing it i know i was upset when i found out i had to marry you but that was mainly because i didntthink you would ever love me and i hated being forced into marriage i knew i could come to love you she touched the stone i wish you could have loved me i wish i had been good enough for you to fall in love with we would have been so happy i think you wouldnthave gone storming off and gotten careless she began to weep it all my fault severus i should never have argued with you about the children i could have left and you would have been free of us i should never have expected you to want me or our daughter he felt the strange sensation of tears welling in his eyes he hadnt cried since he was a child but the loving and anguished words of the woman he married struck him to the heart and he felt overwhelmed by the love and caring she had for him she loved him for reasons similar to why he loved her he realized she was brilliant determined brave and incredibly loyal to her friends and family she knew what she wanted and it was with a start that he realized she d wanted him bloody hell he saw the signs but refused to allow himself to think his wildest dreams came true he remembered the first time they fell asleep together after one of the obligatory conjugal visits he woke up to find hermione naked body curled against him her head on his chest and one arm draped over his waist an incredible warm feeling washed over him as he held her and the hardest thing he d ever done was to wake her up and send her back to her room he had not understood the stricken look in her eyes at the time he was too busy reminding himself that the sex was forced and the ministry controlled their lives with the bloody marriage law he would not give in to their scheme to repopulate the wizarding world with half bloods nice one snape that was a touch of class shut it black i dontneed the commentary harry will be a good father severus i do love him and i think one day i can be truly happy with him we ve both changed a lot and i think we re far more able to be together now than we were three years ago it kinda funny that i can thank you for much of that if he hadntbeen my friend and confidant during our marriage i would have found some other way to lure you into my life severus frowned as potter walked up harry wha what are you doing here i noticed you out here i brought you a cloak it a bit cold outside thanks harry so having a good chat well it pretty one sided but i ll leave you alone so you can finish love i just dontwant you to get too chilled no i done here i can always talk to severus next week she placed a dark red rose on the grave harry stepped away as she gently touched the stone i love you severus rest well tears fell from his eyes as he watched his wife and her new love head back to the castle hand in hand all he wanted to do was shout at her that he loved her that he had always loved her that he was sorry for everything he did and failed to do it was the most helpless he ever felt in his life and he hated it where to next black i need to go somewhere anywhere else sirius looked at the potions master sadly i know just the place the great hall was filled with people severus recognized as the guests from their wedding the students and a number of officials from the ministry it was the night of their wedding and the reception was in full swing hermione was dancing with bill weasley laughing at one of his witty comments he felt a surge of jealousy at the sight remembering how happy she had been around everyone but him maybe if you hadntbeen pouting in the corner she would have enjoyed your company more commented sirius he tossed the animagus a killing glare his obsidian eyes scanning the hall for his former self he located the dark figure seated in the back corner of the room scowling and carrying on a grudging conversation with draco malfoy he remembered it well just one dance uncle severus you re going to have to be together for at least a short while the least you can do is give her that i believe the least i can do is what i have done thus far draco she will be receiving the best education money can buy a lifestyle most women would envy and virtually anything she may ask for why do i need to embarrass myself further in front of all these people the last was said with distaste it traditional for the groom to dance at least once with the bride uncle surely you dontwant the ministry to think this marriage is a farce it is a farce draco all they care about is the fact that we signed the contract and follow its dictates to the letter dancing was not part of it i believe you re such a sorry sot this is supposed to be the happiest day of her life draco you mistake yourself this is not supposed to be the happiest day of her life that will come i believe when she marries the man she wants in truth not when she obeys the orders of the ministry what if you fail what what if the marriage law is never rescinded you will have made the happiest day of her life into a mockery of what it should be bloody hell draco are you sure your name isntmolly weasley i dont need you guilting me in to dancing with my student the former slytherin glared at him and then looked away realizing his words fell on deaf ears fine uncle severus have it your way i guess it up to the rest of us to make sure your wife has a pleasant evening he got up and stormed off in the direction of the dance floor severus could see hermione was enjoying herself in potter arms bloody prat how dare he dance with his wife that when it hit him she was no longer his student she was his wife tonight they were supposed to consummate their marriage or it would be annulled by the ministry a small tendril of feeling crept out from behind the thick walls separating him from his students he had never truly lusted after a student before he refused to allow himself to admittedly he found many of them attractive including hermione and a number of young women had thought the greasy git would be easy to seduce for better grades no one however had engaged his mind like the young miss granger mrs snape his mind whispered without thought he rose and strode toward his wife she was dancing with draco now and it was with a great deal of pleasure that he tapped on his godson shoulder may i cut in the velvet tones were deceptively soft with a hint of steel draco bowed to hermione my lady snape pulled her to him placing a hand on her waist and shoulder as she did the same the music changed at that moment thanks to albus dumbledore he suspected and the soft strains of an ancient love song filled the room the floor cleared and all watched in respectful silence as the new couple danced thank you she said softly his eyebrow arched in surprise what for i know you donttypically dance especially not with students you are no longer my student hermione i seem to remember a ceremony that hinted strongly at something else she blushed i i know severus but it not easy to get used to in such a short period of time yes i know it is not easy for me either however he caught her eyes i think we might be able to get used to it i yes i think so too tell me hermione are you always this shy uh i dontknow what do you mean i mean i have seen you dance with any number of people and you never seemed this hesitant with any of them why is that oh uh i guess it a lot easier to dance with friends than with i thought i was a friend well yes but her eyes darted about nervously you re more than that now severus i uh am not exactly used to well uh hermione have you ever dated a young man n not really victor and i were more friends than anything i wasnt interested in ron that way and harry uh we never he was shocked no slytherin girl he knew of ever made it to her seventh year without having some sort of experience with a young man hermione was far more beautiful than many of the girls he d caught snogging or more in the various hidey holes and classrooms over the years it was unfathomable to him that she had no experience not to mention intimidating the last time he was with a willing woman had been last year in knockturn alley bloody hell severus is there something wrong did i say something no no i was just uh thinking about tonight and how i going to completely screw it up her cheeks flamed red again oh hermione his deep silky voice grabbed her attention i promise you everything will be fine i wonthurt you i not afraid of that severus i just if possible she turned redder you just what he tried to moderate his annoyance at being interrupted and made his voice gentle uh i was just uh afraid that it wontbe good for you he chuckled dontworry about me hermione i ll be fine o okay i read about it you know he smirked why am i not surprised i wanted to learn besides only through education can we make things better i not sure this sort of thing can be improved by education experience is best my dear well i wasntabout to go out and get experience severus shhhh easy i didntmean to offend you you ll do fine hermione trust me he never understood what had come over him when she revealed she never experienced the pleasures of the flesh but he couldnthelp but want to soothe her and make her as relaxed as possible the result was a severus snape that danced the rest of the evening with his young bride to the consternation of the rest of the young men in the room part of his actions were calculated to stake his claim and inform them in no uncertain terms that she was no longer available he had noticed how the little wankers looked at her he was not about to let them think they could get away with trying to woo her away from her husband admittedly it was an arranged marriage but she was still his wife i surprised you didntleap on a table and howl your dominance snape that would be more down your alley black shall we move on to the wedding night once again sirius found himself pinned to a wall you may possess the memories black but i will not allow you to insult hermione by watching one of the most intimate experiences of her life you will not spy on her when she is unclothed for any reason you get me sure snape i get you i just thought you might want to see i am well aware of what happened that night i dontneed your snide commentary mucking up my memories he gazed at her longingly it is all i have left of her there was nothing however preventing him from perusing the memory the party had lasted for some time until hermione dragged him away early accompanied by the hooting and catcalls of the weasley boys she said they stayed long enough for courtesy but now it was time for them to have time together he kept a straight face while she told him since her matter of fact speech was at odds with her furiously blushing countenance headmaster dumbledore made the arrangements for them to stay in a parisian hotel for their honeymoon an event he insisted was unnecessary but was talked into nonetheless when hermione squealed with joy and leapt into his arms at the news it occurred to him that making her happy could definitely have its benefits the hotel was magnificent their suite was enormous possessing a soft sunken couch with a recess for a fire in the center the walls were soft ivory accented with small golden stripes and fleur de lis a massive four poster bed dominated the room made up with amber silk sheets and a thick velvet comforter the color of pearls translucent panels of egyptian silk fell from a canopy above the bed the cream colored carpets were deep and luxurious and he found himself smiling indulgently as his wife cast her shoes aside and walked around the room reveling in the sensation of such comfort he secretly did the same while she was in the bathroom sometime later the house elves stored their belongings and with the unique sensitivity of their kind provided fruit and champagne before retiring for the night oddly enough hermione was the one who broke the uncomfortable silence by opening up the bottle and dragging him outside to the balcony the drink relaxed them both which allowed them to begin a conversation on the view of paris moving on to other subjects as they reestablished their rapport she was also the one that made the first move coming to sit in his lap as they discussed the latest ars alchemica having her so close made it impossible to ignore the attraction he felt for her and he barely remembered her status as his student when she touched her lips to his all thought fled from him as desires long withheld burst forth to consume them both it was all he could do to control himself that night but the knowledge that she was untouched did a great deal to reign in his urges he did everything he could to make it as pleasurable as possible making that night stand out in his mind as the single best night of his life you did really well snape she probably could have fallen in love with you on the strength of that night alone i know she certainly was happy when you returned to hogwarts he tried to be offended but realized it was pointless thank you black i d always wondered he gave an amused chuckle you know she read a stack of books on sex before we got married just so she could make it good for me she was amazing never in my life had anyone put that much effort into ugh please snape the imagery it burns my brain snape smiled maliciously she seduced me the next morning it was truly amazing one thing you can say about hermione is that she is very good at anything she does and i mean anything i woke up to find augh no more i think it time for us to go somewhere else his smirk was wide enough to almost be called a smile i thought you wanted me to remember the good stuff black remember all you want snape just dontshare sirius was surprised when snape began laughing he had never heard the sound outside hermione memories and it was a startling experience he had to admit the git had a good laugh deep and full no wonder she loved it all right moving on sirius waved his wand and the two men vanished this time they appeared in the private room of a restaurant snape recognized as being a malfoy favorite draco ginny harry and hermione were there seated around a large table the place settings were formal china and crystal the white and gold contrasting with the deep burgundy linen the room was lined with a dark wood carved with the proud figures of wizards and dragons the waiter took their orders and left the friends free to continue their conversation only three more months hermione and then you ll be a mother she already a mother gin you know what i mean harry he stuck his tongue out at her she ignored him and continued it getting to that time when you need to have a baby shower draco and harry rolled their eyes i thought wizards only did the naming ceremony they do but you have muggle parents and friends your mother would be really disappointed if she didnthave this chance oh bloody hell ginny tell me i wrong hermione sighed no you re right mum been over the moon about the baby and i know she d love to show off to all our neighbors and their friends good we can have it at your house then how about next weekend uh i ll have to ask my parents is that okay with you harry harry looked startled what why me well you said you want to be there for everything uh i uh you canthave it both ways potter just think of what my godfather would have thought about this they laughed he would have done it though hermione said softly harry took her hand and brought it to his lips yes he would have love he still will be you know wherever he is right now i sure he watching over you and your daughter she smiled at him gratefully wiping her eyes we can have the naming ceremony at our place hermione draco quiet pronouncement startled them all thank you draco he smiled depreciatingly not a problem hermione just remember that i expect to have the right to spoil the little angel i doubt i could stop you draco you re far too slytherin for me to resist she smiled impishly hey harry looked at her indignantly oh come on harry surely you know that nobility is wonderful but there nothing like a bad boy to liven things up ginny winked at him before turning back to her friend i ll owl your mother and take care of the planning hermione you and harry just have to show up the waiter arrived with their food at that moment and the rest of dinner was passed in pleasant conversation severus watched his wife throughout the meal and was both elated and distressed at what he saw it appeared she and harry had progressed in their relationship to a level of comfort that included casual touches and loving glances each one felt like a spear in his heart but he was also relieved to see his wife was moving beyond her grief ginny and draco seemed happy at the gryffindors new closeness the most terrible thing for him was that he realized the time was quickly approaching where he would no longer be able to see them somehow he knew that once the baby was born his time would be over and he would have to move on to wherever it was ex death eaters went after death he hoped someday he would see his hermione again you will snape she loves you too much for you to be kept apart he looked at the other ghost gratefully thank you black that makes it a little easier it hard i know watching harry all this time it been torture there were so many times i wanted to talk to him tell him to say something do something i really envied you in the final battle i wanted to be there at his side more than anything thank you for keeping him safe you re welcome black as much as i despised him i never wanted to see harry meet his parents fate me neither sirius looked at him appraisingly before he gestured for snape to follow him okay snape i think the time has come for us to visit one of the major sources of difficulty in your marriage no you are not taking me to alexandria oh yes i am a wave of his wand and they were gone thanks for the kind words everyone i ll do what i can to keep the updates coming you guys are great i promise this will not be a dead end story i absolutely hate those stories that catch my interest and then fade away as the author moves on to bigger and better things azulkan2 i d apologize about the angst but i wanted this story to begin like this dontworry i ll show my romantic side in later chapters i warn you now however this is probably my most angsty chapter thus far queen give it another chapter and you ll have the answer to your question angelbabe believe it or not i actually a big harry hermione shipper i got sold on the hermione snape thing after being broadsided by a story on so i can go either way now on to the story waves of heat coursed through severus as they appeared in the sun blasted city of alexandria he recognized the familiar features as being part of the ancient city wizarding haven wizards and witches draped in traditional robes hurried about intent on whatever business took them out into the heat the famous lines of the great library could be seen in the distance he had a terrible feeling as he realized it was time to face one of his most painful and delightful memories hermione appeared near the gates at the official apperation point with severus only an instant behind the two ghosts his past self immediately identified them while pulling out their wizarding visas for the inspectors several minutes later they were allowed into the city he and sirius followed the couple to a posh building near the center of town it was the nicest hotel money could buy being a small oasis in the depths of the desert the entire two story building appeared to be carved out of white alabaster and was ensconced in the depths of lush palms and flowered bushes providing color to an otherwise plain architecture cooling charms kept the temperature to a reasonable level and the quiet tinkle of flowing water provided a soothing background the severus of the past and his wife carefully picked their way through the abundant foliage stopping occasionally when hermione saw an especially rare flower he smiled indulgently thinking draco had been spot on with his assessment of his wife desires it was a strange thing to be looking forward to spending time with someone a small man with skin like tanned leather sat behind a desk right inside the building he welcomed them with a friendly smile and using the translation charms hermione found gave them their room keys a visitor guide and summoned a house elf to take care of them during their stay the room was luxurious severus had seen to that and it appeared hermione was once again overwhelmed by the careless display of wealth he demonstrated in their single year of marriage one thing he d learned about his wife was that her parents raised her to be frugal it had actually been amusing to see her reaction when he showed her his vault in gringott s they were staying on the second floor in a multi room suite with a balcony the room overlooked the city with a wonderful view of the great library verdant greenery provided the terrace with privacy hiding the small hot spring from prying eyes from her gleeful squeal he could tell his wife was looking forward luxuriating in the steaming pool a hot wash of desire passed through his body at the thought hermione quickly unpacked their things cheerfully making herself at home in the open aired bedroom he d fought with himself about renting it but when he saw the view provided by the wide open windows he knew immediately that it would be perfect for their trip the idea according to draco was to provide her with a happy experience he intended to do just that a large canopied bed dominated the center of the room the linens were comforting shades of blue and green reminiscent of cool water the thick mattress was covered with silk sheets and a blue velvet comforter the color of the sea a multitude of large fluffy pillows adorned the bed he almost laughed when his wife ran to the bed and threw herself among them her joy in life always amazed him join me severus his eyebrow arched i do not believe i am of an age to be playing games with pillows she smiled wickedly that depends on what games we re going to play he almost choked at her implication come on severus dontbe a prude it was unfathomable that she the virginal queen of gryffindor was calling him a former deatheater a prude his eyes narrowed i am not being prudish hermione i am simply refusing to behave like a child this time she pouted oh come on severus i just asking you to join me in bed how childish is that how could those mocha eyes of hers go from hedonistic to pleading in an instant hermione fine severus i guess i ll just play by myself then his eyes widened in shock did she mean her joyful laughter as she gleefully lay back and was swallowed by the pillows touched his heart apparently she was simply enjoying the luxury provided by the resort damn severus oh bloody hell what now yes she sat up pinning him with a glare there no need to be crabby i was just wondering what we were doing for dinner dinner ah yes dinner bloody hell he glanced at the clock we are going to get dressed and go some place very nice in fifteen minutes i suggest you she bolted upright fifteen minutes that not enough time to get ready severus oh bugger it was amusing to watch while his wife whisked around the room getting ready by the time he was dressed and ready to go eight minutes thank you very much she was in front of the mirror dressed wrestling with her hair the first time he saw her do this he d asked her disdainfully why she considered herself a witch if she didntuse magic to style her hair she informed him that she did but she had to comb her hair before casting the spell no wand could smooth out the kinks in her unruly mane knowing she was just making it worse in her panic he strode over and plucked the brush from her hand stilling her with a glance he deftly began brushing her hair smoothing out the tangles it really was quite soft he thought remembering the few times he succumbed to temptation and ran his hands through it her eyes were closed in pleasure and he allowed himself a tiny smile of satisfaction a few minutes later he pronounced he was done thank you severus he loved it when her voice was soft and defenseless like that it was his own fault he knew that she rarely spoke with him that way he always seemed to bring out the fire in her with his snarky words and sarcastic commentary maybe someday that would change hermione quickly cast the spell to pull her hair up and secured it with the beautiful sapphire and gold comb the malfoys gave her for her birthday last year it matched her robes which were a deep rich shade of blue edged with gold knotwork the quickly applied shadow and lip gloss only served to accentuate her already stunning beauty she took his breath away done he eyed the clock fourteen minutes and thirty three seconds impressive no other woman he knew was capable of getting ready for a date in less than an hour he had to admit however he honestly had no idea how long it usually took hermione this was the first actual date they d been on in dear merlin ever maybe he would have to remedy that the couple grabbed their cloaks it grew cold in the desert at night and left for the restaurant severus held out his arm for his wife and they walked arm in arm to the golden phoenix by her smile he could tell his wife appreciated the irony dinner passed in a very pleasant manner they discussed the history of the area severus acquainted her on the events that actually occurred during that fateful time centuries ago and made plans to visit several local attractions including the great library hermione was thrilled to learn their vacation was for an entire week so much so that she leaped into her husband arms upon their return to the suite and kissed him like she d wanted to earlier in the day the night was spent in blissful pleasure the next few days were eventful they toured the area exploring the various wonders of alexandria together it did not take too long for them to relax into an even deeper camaraderie produced by the closeness that comes only from sharing an experience with a loved one it came as a shock to severus when he realized that he truly did love his wife it was three days after they began their trip hermione was off in a dress shop and he found himself wandering aimlessly about after arranging for some rare potions ingredients to be delivered to hogwarts the flash of gold caught his eye and he decided to investigate the source was a pendant hanging in the window of a small jewelry shop remembering draco advice and honestly wanting to do something nice for her the dark haired wizard entered the store he was immediately greeted by an elderly woman with wise blue eyes she shrewdly guessed he was vacationing with his wife and began asking questions about her normally he would have been offended by her presumption but she reminded him of albus dumbledore and he found himself telling the woman all about his young wife she gave him a kind smile when he finished and moved over to one of the counters i have the perfect thing for you mr snape she pulled out a beautiful gold link chain and an amber pendant carved with egyptian hieroglyphics if you wish i can spell your beloved name on the other side to make it a more personal gift he nodded amazed beyond speech that she d found something so perfect the stone was a perfect match for the highlights in his wife hair and he knew she would love the carvings on the stone minutes later the gift was carved wrapped and paid for and he was standing outside the shop wondering what just happened the evening bell woke him from his reverie it was time to fetch his wife for their evening at montaza palace she really had your number didntshe snape started he d forgotten completely about the annoying gryffindor that was his guide i suppose so hermione certainly thought it was a perfect gift so perfect in fact that she leaped on him and gave him the most incredible seduction of his life apparently his wife had learned a lot about pleasing a man from those books she read he felt a pain of regret at the realization that he wasted three years of what could have been mind blowing sex he couldnthelp but wonder why she d never tried to seduce him after the trip that an easy one to answer snape sirius ignored his sharp glare she did try you just behaved like an ass as usual what the hell are you on about black let finish this and i ll show you they spent next three days at the library where he gained a new admiration for his wife single minded intellect apparently she d made up a list of things she wanted to research and diligently worked her way through it during the time they were there the only time she allowed him to take her away from the reading room was to eat during the day or sleep at night he still managed to seduce her however the last night of their trip was an overnight cruise down the nile the boat was a luxuriously appointed river barge decorated in the style of the ancient royals cleopatra was said to possess one so comfortable it was like being in her own palace translucent panels maroon and violet damask ensured their privacy while traveling down the river severus was amused to see the sleeping area was a simple mattress covered in plump goose down pillows with a heavy silk coverlet making love on a river under the stars was an experience he knew he would never forget and he mentally blessed his godson for suggesting this trip he d never been this happy the person that said parting was such sweet sorrow certainly knew what they spoke of the next morning it was a somber hermione and severus that disembarked from the riverboat to return to the hotel and pack up their things his wife didntseem as upset as him probably because her natural enthusiasm inspired her to look at the bright side of everything in retrospect looking back with the wisdom of a man beyond death he knew the reason she was so happy was because of the way he d demonstrated his love for her during the short time they were away he could see the idealism in her eyes the hope that things would not return to what they were upon arriving in england if only he d realized that at the time they returned to england and immediately found themselves caught up in the moment upon reaching their quarters she was still so beautiful glowing with the inner fire of her spirit that he found himself unable to keep his hands off her he d always wondered who moved first and was pleased to see they actually lunged for each other at the same time they met in a passionate kiss and quickly stumbled to the bedroom where they made passionate love all night long watching himself the next morning severus felt the urge to slap his past self and order himself to stay in bed and attend to his wife he woke up first habitually having set an internal alarm clock hermione was still in his arms wrapped around him and gloriously naked from last night he needed to get up soon but was reluctant to move unfortunately his appointment with the ministry was today and he couldntafford to be late gazing at his still somnolent wife he considered skiving off the meeting to stay here with her he stroked her hair smiling gently at his memories of the past week he loved her he knew some how she crept her way into his heart and wrapped herself around his soul she was kind loving caring and the most intelligent and knowledgeable woman he d ever met if he believed in soulmates he would have chosen her in an instant she smiled in her sleep letting out a small sigh of contentment it was times like this that reminded him of how young and innocent she was that was why he had to get this bloody law repealed the selfish part of him wanted to give up and enjoy the fruits of the ministry idiocy but he loved her far too much to force her to stay with him she seemed content during the past few days but he knew she d been struggling to be happy over the past year it was because of him potter would have been able to satisfy her with his soft words and rampant displays of emotion he was far too inclined to hide how he felt behind layers of hostility and sarcasm if he truly loved her he had to give her up hermione he shook her gently hermione you need to wake up her eyes fluttered open severus what is it i need to get up to go to the ministry this morning i ll be finding out about the appeal two years ago he hadntseen the flicker of disappointment that flashed across her face before she gave him a feeble smile he simply thought she was tired at the time but now he knew it was because she was pretending to be happy on his account that s wonderful severus i i guess i ll let you get ready then she hopped out of bed and fled the room without a backwards glance he frowned looking after her as she left his eyes grew hard and cold as he remembered her smile upon learning about his meeting what the bloody hell was he thinking of course she wanted the marriage law repealed then she could run off with potter and live happily ever after he scowled at the thought and resolved not to think of her any longer hermione was waiting for him in the living room with breakfast already laid out her welcoming smile only infuriated him and he glared at her in response he stalked over to the table and grabbed his coffee i trust you were satisfied with the trip to alexandria he inquired icily oh yes severus it was wonderful good then i imagine this experience will tide you over until next year hermione looked confused what what do you mean it is my understanding that women require routine maintenance in the form of romantic excursions and expensive trinkets to function pleasantly in a marriage you have had your trip and i believe the jewelry i purchased for you should be of sufficient value to placate you the shocked look on her face should have clued him in to the wrongness of his supposition it quickly turned to fury what the bloody fuck is that supposed to mean placate function pleasantly severus i thought we took that trip together to celebrate our first anniversary i thought it was because you lo cared about me it hurt to see the tears in her eyes and know that his past self was responsible for her pain his voice was distant and diamond hard i care about you as much as i required to do so by the contract binding us you are being provided with an education shelter and the freedom to do as you wish i have ordered the house elves to provide you with appropriate gifts throughout the year to aid in your happiness aside from that however i will not be responsible for fulfilling your unrealistic expectations of love and friendship you would do well to remember that neither of us is a willing participant in this sham of a marriage and as soon as it is over the better off we will be but what about she whispered her voice pained the only reason i took you on that trip hermione was because my godson suggested it would be a good thing to do to ensure pleasant relations for the coming year i did not realize it would result in making you clingier than before her eyes flashed with anger clingier even after a year of marriage severus had not learned how to recognized the danger signs that he pushed her too far today was one of those times when wished he d learned that lesson i dontbelieve you the nerve you can take your bloody altruism and shove it snape i tired of feeling like the villain in this relationship because you re still hacked off at the ministry for not operating by your every whim i had a wonderful time in alexandria and i had hoped you did too i guess that not possible for a sorry sot like yourself who is unable to feel basic human emotions she stood up and moved to within inches of her husband i wish you luck on your hearing snape because the last thing i want to do with the rest of my life is be bound to a heartless bastard like you she stormed off to her room and slammed the door leaving her husband standing there in stunned disbelief harry and ron could have told him if he asked that a hermione in full rant was a terrible sight to behold it was even worse if one were the target harry had always been lucky and truth be told wise enough to escape her wrath but ron was another matter he could have given snape the chapter and verse of dealing with hermione in a rage unfortunately the redhead wasntaround to give advice severus left for the ministry with his wife still locked in her room angry as fluffy with rabies by the time he got back she d calmed down into an icy demeanor he never imagined her capable of several days later he found out that she gained a seat on the wizengamot due to what he thought was his family influence he was so bloody convinced she owed him for what he d done for her but now he realized she never needed him at all had she left and moved to the united states she would have a far better life than what he provided her it was too bad he was dead he d be up in dumbledore office right now giving the scheming headmaster a piece of his mind how dare he manipulate her like that he was doing what he thought was best for you snape what he thought you were either going to become the next dark lord or commit suicide because your life was so dank and depressing he thought hermione would be the perfect person to snap you out of the dark and brooding persona you developed over the years he should have said something i thought the reason hermione married me was because she wanted to stay in england without having to become a muggle you thought you were doing her a favor i suppose so you re such an arse snape do you have anything positive to say black or is this simply an exercise in telling me how much i buggered things up sirius shrugged i suppose i a bit biased in the things i showing you but you have a tendency to be a bit thick headed i want to make sure you really get it before we move on to the end i believe i get the point there only one more thing i think you need to see then we can take a look at the rest of the good stuff sirius gave snape an unusually somber look this next memory is an answer to the question you asked before i showing it to you because i dontthink you truly understand how much you meant to hermione no dont interrupt you ve seen her romantic feelings but i bet you never really thought about the physical aspects of your relationship outside a few instances every physical encounter you ve had with her has been due to the ministry and your obligation what the bloody hell do you mean black did hermione ever seduce you outside your trip to alexandria i believe i mentioned earlier that she did not i always wondered about that well let find out shall we they appeared in his wife bedroom to find her frantically moving about levitating candles lighting them and positioning them with short flicks of her wand the room was bathed in gentle golden light by the time she was finished and she hurried over to the cabinet to pull out a device he recognized as her muggle music player she quickly pulled out a handful of slim boxes and selected one based on criteria only she knew the small clear case opened to reveal a silvery disk which she inserted into the muggle device a few pressed buttons later and soft music filled the room she smiled apparently satisfied with her arrangements and rushed into her bathroom where she stayed for several minutes snape eyes almost popped out of his head when she stepped out hermione had changed into an amber silk nightgown he d never seen which clung to her curves and fell to mid thigh enhancing her already incredible beauty she looked like a goddess incarnate her hair was piled atop her head in a style reminiscent of their wedding night and she wore the necklace he bought her in alexandria interesting this occurred after he had royally hacked her off hermione went to the fireplace and summoned dobby the house elf who returned minutes later with a tray filled with strawberries liquid chocolate and assorted edibles winky came in bearing an ice bucket into which hermione placed a bottle of what appeared to be french champagne what the bloody hell is this black oh you really are an idiot snape what do you think it is a meeting with potter he knew the fidelity charm did not prevent romantic interludes only copulation black raised his hand as if to smack him no you git it hermione way of asking you for a truce she was hoping you might be willing to actually try and make the marriage work i think she figured the time had come to show you that she was truly interested in you when was this guess severus wracked his brains trying to remember a time he d gone to hermione room to find it like this and could not recall anything time passed while he thought and the candles burned down to mere nubs while the ice melted and the fruit grew warm hours passed and his wife sat there expectantly for someone she soon realized was not coming great timing snape as always hermione finally had enough and stomped over to the fireplace throwing in a handful of floo powder she stuck her head in the green flames and called out ginny malfoy name what is it hermione how did it go ginny is draco there yes he asleep though could you get him for me what wrong severus hasntreturned to our rooms and he hasntsent a message to say he is going to be late i worried about him suddenly snape had a bad feeling he knew when this took place i ll get him hermione moments later draco joined his wife at the fireplace i sorry for waking you draco but i worried for severus he never been this late before without at least sending me a message where did he go today he said he had some errands to run that would probably last most of the day i was expecting him back for dinner hermione blushed as draco looked her up and down leering only dinner his wife smacked him draco malfoy you mind yourself sorry uh i not sure where he could be hermione i haventseen uncle severus at all today do you know exactly where he went she shook her head he didntsay hmm that odd let me see what i can find out my father taught me a tracing spell that should enable me to find him ginny turned to look at her husband it not a dark magic spell is it draco smirked not dark magic per se but it does require a bit of my blood oh draco you dontneed to actually yes i do hermione you know as well as i do that there are people out there that would love to get a hold of severus snape the great traitor he my godfather the least i can do is make sure he is not languishing in some deatheater dungeon thank you no problem now give me about an hour i ll let you know what i find out severus knew what happened draco traced him to his ancestral home where he d gone to battle the demons created by his love for hermione and their almost daily conflicts he sniped at her and she sniped right back making him angry enough to go out of his way to hurt her she ran away and he spent the day feeling guilty and furious trying to figure out how things went horribly wrong that morning had been too much for him she refused to speak with him saying only that if they couldnttalk civilly with each other than they might as well not talk at all he d left in a rage apparating to knockturn alley where he had every intention of straining the limits of the fidelius charm one kiss from the lady assigned to him had brought his conscience screaming to the fore and he left as if she set his hair on fire out of desperation he transported himself to his hated home where he proceeded to drink himself into oblivion he d forgotten it was their second anniversary that was how his godson found him hours later drunk on the floor smelling like cheap perfume with lipstick on his face he d never imagined draco could get that upset he never fully knew what the boy said to him but now he had the opportunity to appreciate his godson temper in all its glory i dontbloody believe you draco stared down at him eyes cold looking for all the world like his father in a righteous fury how could you do this to your wife snape what the hell were you thinking oh please let me you werentthinking were you or at least not with the right part of your body i ve a good mind to take you over to the avery and leave you on the doorstep you ve done a lot of miserable and pathetic things in your life but this tops them all do you have any idea what this would do to her if she found out draco pointed a shaking wand at the unconscious man i should put you out of her misery right now i probably would too except that i d go to azkaban leaving ginny alone and hermione would be heartbroken merlin only knows why you should be thanking the gods every day of your sorry life that you have someone like her to love where would you be without her you arse married to some random bint who probably wouldntcare what you did with your lips or your time draco swept up a bottle and hurled it into the fire damn it you fucking bastard black was right about you i used to admire you uncle severus i used to think you were worth something but the past two years have taught me how mistaken i was he sat down in one of the chairs and leaned forward conversationally you know hermione always told me that you had to push people away so that they wouldntget hurt while you were a spy for voldemort she said you were a different person on the inside not nice but not an evil deatheating git like weasley and potter always thought you know i have to say that for once in her life hermione was wrong and they were right you really are a bastard i hope you rot in hell for the things you have done scourgify the perfume and lipstick disappeared leaving only the foul stench of a drunken man behind she doesntneed to see you like this draco continued the last thing she needs to know is that her husband decided to get pissed off his arse and betray her on her second anniversary i almost tempted to beat the living crap out of you just so i can say you were attacked unfortunately i think hermione would see right through it so i leaving you here i going to tell her that you had a difficult day and fell asleep at the manor i hope for your sake that she believes me draco had left him a short curt note informing him that he missed his second anniversary and that his wife was under the impression that he d been working on something in his lab at the manor he was told to go and find her something very nice and very expensive and to return home as soon as possible a sober up potion was waiting for him and somehow he knew it was not for his benefit wow you really buggered up that one why d you do that i honestly forgot it was our anniversary we fought and i guess i just got sick and tired of getting the cold shoulder so you went and found a hooker it was better than throwing her on the bed and treating her like one uh huh look black i wasntthinking i i wanted to get back at her for making me feel bad deep down i knew this would hurt her very deeply and was only interested in lashing out at her well you succeeded beyond your wildest dreams take a look they appeared in a room he recognized as one of the guest bedrooms at malfoy manor this had to be shortly after their second anniversary she d taken a short vacation from him and stayed with her best friend and her husband his wife and ginny malfoy were lounging next to the fireplace chatting and playing some sort of muggle game go fish oh bloody hell if i didntknow you better i d say you were cheating hermione i hurt how could you say such a thing you re married to the prince of slytherin ginny you honestly think he hasntrubbed off on you after two years ginny giggled like you should talk you husband the head of slytherin you re still as gryffindor as ever her eyes widened as she realized what she said oh god hermione i sorry i hermione shook her head it okay ginny you were just playing ginny eyed her friend shrewdly before tossing her cards in the pile all right hermione spill what happened to drive you away from your own bloody home apparently draco never told his wife what happened i it just oh god ginny i dontknow what to do anymore i thought things would get better after i graduated but it actually gotten worse worse oh not like that he just pushed me farther away and here i thought he might have actually come to care for me what happened we did a lot of work on my final project and everything seemed to be going well i figured maybe he just needed some time to get used to me not being a student and that my nearing graduation was helping him reconcile the school girl image of me with that of his wife hermione it been two bloody years how the hell does he see you as anything but he been advising me on my projects it think it reminds him of my days at hogwarts so what happened our second anniversary was two days ago ten days after i graduated i thought i would celebrate by surprising him when he got back from running his errands yeah you never told me how that turned out but i think i figured it out i cantbelieve i did it the seduction scene candles music roses champagne i bought a beautiful silk negligee that matched the necklace he gave me i did my hair makeup and had the house elves fix a nice tray of fruit and canap s for dinner i took your advice on dessert at that she blushed i thought everything would be perfect but he never came home she nodded he never came home no owl no nothing just his total absence she choked back a sob oh hermione severus was gazing at his young bride in shock he was still shocked that she planned something special for their second anniversary after what happened following the first he figured she would rather be alone than spend it with him that was one of the reasons he spent the night at snape manor drinking himself into oblivion draco found him at the manor you know i know you flooed us remember how could i forget anything of that bloody night i cantbelieve he would do that to me do what you should really value your husband ginny he really quite thoughtful unfortunately he forgot to dispose of the evidence when he left severus at the manor what do you mean i not a total fool ginny severus falling asleep in his lab is about as likely as me falling asleep on a broom i went there to check on him and found him laid out on the floor surrounded by fire whiskey bottles draco is in so much trouble hermione shook her head it not worth it ginny he was just trying to protect me from his godfather insensitivity so did you hex him she laughed i probably should have no i left him a sober up potion and had the house elves clean up you re far more forgiving than i am maybe i just a bigger fool because you love him how can i love a man that thinks a bottle of fire whiskey is far better company than his know it all wife i suppose that a point nice one snape way to go shut it black besides how could he love someone like me i just a bushy haired know it all bookworm he was forced to marry let face it if this bloody marriage law had never happened i d probably never have gotten married i mean who could love this snape was stunned you silly girl how could you believe someone could not love someone as intelligent and beautiful as you are maybe because you didn t asked sirius i honestly dontsee why i love him he sees me as an inconvenience foisted upon him by the bloody ministry of magic what made me think we could live together amicably and maybe become friends or more you re a gryffindor granger your head has always been filled with fluff about that sort of thing draco malfoy strode into the room radiating his usual confidence and charming sort of sarcasm hermione gave him a hug hey draco thanks for trying he shrugged it the least i can do for my second favorite gryffindor i take it he didntbeg your forgiveness she shook her head he ignored both the potion and your advice idiot thanks draco i guess some things were just not meant to be kind of like alexandria it was wonderful right up until the point that we woke up the next morning it must have hit him like a ton of bricks i guess the reality of being nice to his unwanted guest hit him i honestly surprised he didntkick me out of the dungeons i dont know what came over him he probably felt his heart for the first time in his life ginny what dontgive me the lecture hermione snape been treating you like this for over two years now and you continue to take it convinced one day he ll realize he loves you maybe he can t maybe you re not the woman for him but she is love that the point dear uncle snape should be over the moon at the thought of being with a woman that is not only his intellectual equal but loves many of the things he does appreciates his dark sarcastic humour is incredibly attractive and most importantly of all loves him i honestly cantthink of why he being such a prat over this it the ministry draco he doesntlike the fact that he was forced to marry me oh and you re so fucking thrilled hermione i sure you just begged the ministry to pair you up with the great greasy git of hogwarts i know it was your life ambition to be forced to ignore the man who loves you in favor of the man who despises everyone does he ever think of anyone but himself i doubt it he probably doesnteven realize i no longer a student it too bad harry what what about potter you mangy mutt are you a total idiot snape i told you he loved her you do realize that harry was going to ask her to marry him after graduation snape was stunned i i had no idea does did she love him i dontknow sirius said quietly but if she didn t it was a close thing bloody hell he been bound to someone for most of his life i get the idea that his home life wasnttoo great she looked inquiringly at draco who nodded and i dontthink he been shown a lot of kindness that no excuse i know ginny but i also understand that after being bound to voldemort then dumbledore for two decades he d have a bit of a problem with being force into a binding marriage with the insufferable know it all he always hated me why should it come as a surprise that he still does she sighed i shouldnthave let dumbledore talk me out of putting my name back in the hat that could have been far worse hermione there were a lot of deatheaters on that list i know draco well maybe i should have gone to america he looked at her curiously why didntyou i ve always wondered about that dumbledore ouch what did he do guilt trip you into marrying uncle severus that pretty low even for him i guess you could call it that he told me i d be the best choice for him of all the women on the ministry list that he might actually find happiness with me since we were so fucking compatible her eyes narrowed sometimes i wish i could hex the old bastard draco laughed you know granger i d pay to see that you against dumbledore i honestly dontknow who d win the two girls began laughing as they pictured the confrontation would you like a lemon drop expelliarmus oh dear there went my candy you could bring a candy wand then you d be sure to win licorice headmaster i ll trade it for your wand chocolate frog pixie sticks he d go into sugar shock the world is yours if you have the right candy the three continued laughing and joking for several minutes while snape and sirius looked on snape had a slight upturn to his lips at the thought of his pureblood godson being so nice to his muggleborn wife perhaps the weasley girl really was good for him it relieved him to see hermione had friends outside of potter and the male weasley she always seemed so lonely around the castle maybe it was because of him time to go snape places to go and people to see wait the laughing had stopped and hermione was gazing into the fire her face thoughtful draco and ginny were near her but almost missed her soft words albus said i understood him and that i appreciated him more than anyone else he told me severus was comfortable around me more than anyone he d ever seen and that he trusted me everything that should make the basis for a good loving marriage there were tears in her eyes as she looked at her friends what did i do wrong we had become friends during the war while working on potions for the order we talked about so many different things and it was wonderful i finally found someone who understood everything i said we had so much in common why couldnti keep him interested long enough for she broke down and began sobbing into her hands draco gently pulled her closer and wrapped his arms around her while ginny held her from the other side it was the last thing snape saw as reality faded away artemis03 in chapter2 snape remembers that draco and ginny were married shortly before the final battle hence they were not victims of the marriage law ravynsword i glad you liked the ceremony it took me a while to write that but the examples on a number of websites helped a great deal sweet dreaming cool idea i guess we ll see if great minds think alike alanfan i thought about italics for that but since i using it for some of the flashbacks and journal entries i thought it might be even more confusing maybe if i had written this differently i could do that i will definitely keep your advice in mind for future fics thank you azulkan hang on to your hat this is going to be a tearjerker whizbees yeah i hope there a happy ending too i was always taught write what you know so i can honestly say yes i ve been there with the low self esteem and known lots of people like me i hadntconsciously thought about it i was just trying to keep the characters as true as they can be in a fic like this thank you for the compliment thanks again for reading i going to try and get the next update out as soon as possible since i imagine you will want to lynch me at the end of this chapter have patience grasshoppers i just want it to be worthy of your time and now back to our programming severus looked around to see where they had gone next it appeared they were outside near the small cemetery behind a castle easily identifiable as hogwart school of witchcraft and wizardry the day was dark and rainy perfect for the funeral it appeared they were attending severus examined the faces of the guests hoping to identify the subject of this somber occasion it you snape sirius appeared next to him in a black suit and robes i thought you might like to see this what in merlin name for look around you you greasy git see how many people there are black was correct there were a lot more people in attendance than he ever expected honestly he always figured albus and draco would be the only people who cared about his death hermione presence didntsurprise him now but the others did he could see the majority of the order every teacher excepting trelawney a good number of students from his past decade of teaching several aurors and the entire compliment of the international potions masters conclave no one looked particularly happy at his demise but several seemed positively gleeful speculating about the circumstances i heard he had a potions accident me too but i honestly cantimagine him buggering a potion up i heard his wife switched his ingredients do you blame her susan bones said he hated her so much he was constantly at the ministry trying to get the act repealed i heard he asked her to unintelligible whisper and she slapped him oh my goodness i bet that when he threatened to kill her it was self defense severus eyed the two former students with disdain leave it to lavender brown and parvati patil to start concocting the most outrageous tripe they could think of to explain his death it was no wonder the prophet was still a rag hiring those two as their premier reporters was the worst thing the newspaper had done since that little slander article on harry potter oooh i love the smell of intrigue in the morning black only a simple minded mutt such as yourself would consider this intrigue at least potter would recognize it for the idiocy that it is aw snape that so sweet i never knew you cared the former professor rolled his eyes in aggravation bloody cur black really was far more bothersome than severus felt like dealing with at the moment he was distracted by the slight commotion as albus dumbledore stepped forward to command everyone to silence standing in front of the sealed casket he began to speak his old voice weary for the first time since the war severus snape was a great man despite all that has been said about him in recent days or even in past years while we might not have found him the most personable of men now there an understatement shut it black he was a man of great honor and courage who spent most of his life sacrificing himself that we may live in a better world few know of severus snape true role in the war against voldemort but i believe now is the time to remedy that what followed was the tragic tale of a young man caught up in the hatred of his heritage coming to realize his mistakes and work to atone for his actions hearing dumbledore speak of him and his sacrifices warmed his heart in a way severus never expected losing out on the order of merlin bothered him far more than he would ever admit to know that the one man he respected above all others found him to be such a heroic figure lay to rest a number of ghosts from his past black watched in silence as the headmaster speech began to penetrate the ice around snape heart it was plain to anyone watching that the unexpectedly large audience was comprised of people who at the very least respected the potions master contributions to the wizarding world even the giggling and gossiping gryffindors he despised so much were silent but teary eyed at the words for their former professor sirius knew it was the next speaker however that would truly affect the mourners few of us knew the true severus snape for who he was but for those who did we found him to be an honorable brave and loyal man who possessed an enviable intellect and brilliance i was honored to call severus my friend and to me he was like the son i never had it was to his great fortune that he had the love of an extraordinary woman upon the time of his death i wish seeing the headmaster so choked up over his death brought home to severus how much the man truly cared for him he felt a tear form in his eye it is my honor to present that woman with a grand gesture he welcomed hermione thank you headmaster dumbledore snape found his eyes glued to the woman that was until recently his wife she was dressed for the deepest mourning in black robes her hair pulled demurely into a knot at the base of her neck and carrying a rose so dark a scarlet it appeared black in her hands she was pale with deep circles under her eyes but gazed proudly at the crowd even as she fidgeted nervously that was always something that amused him his wife was so incredibly confident but ask her to speak in front of people and she turned into a right mess i am hermione jane snape and severus was my husband she began proudly uh oh hang onto your hats muttered sirius what shhh pay attention your wife is talking albus is right he was a hero a master of potions a spy a professor and a former deatheater but more than that he was a man who spent the majority of his life living as he saw fit and doing what he thought was right many of us called him the greasy git of the dungeons others derided him for his ugliness lack of charisma or the stern method by which he taught there are many still who call him the great traitor many purebloods blame him for their loss of the war and during our marriage he received at least one death threat a week because of them my husband was never able to fully relax never able to let down his guard for fear a vengeful former follower of voldemort would harm him or me while we enjoyed the peace given to us by his labours he functioned as if we were still at war she eyed those purebloods in the audience challengingly he never blamed them for their convictions he knew they honestly believed in the cause and would never rest until he paid for betraying them it too bad they never took the time to ask themselves what would have happened had voldemort won did severus turn against voldemort because he disagreed with the cause or did he do it because he realized it was all a lie severus had this incredible gift of seeing the truth in anything and i can only imagine what he must have thought the first time he was told to rape some muggle as a way to forward voldemort schemes what was the purpose why was he being asked to sully himself in such a manner there are many who say he betrayed his master because he knew the cause was lost anyone who believes that is the idiot my husband thought them he was the second most trusted member of the deatheaters yet he chose to give all that up for a life of danger and potential death in order to make this world a better place we would not have won if not for his contributions to the order of the phoenix he did more for the cause than the majority of us combined because of him so many people will have the chances for happiness he was denied he fought for me for you and most of all for our children when the marriage law came about i saw it as the ultimate insult to muggleborn now i know it was more than that it was an insult to purebloods as well how could they do that to us how could they do that to him after more than twenty years of sacrifice how could they take away his most basic right the right to choose whom he spent the rest of his life with i know i am not who he would have chosen snape shook his head and murmured his disagreement but he did not let that dictate my future severus cared for me enough to encourage me in my studies and to help me fulfill my dreams i may not have loved him at first but i cared enough to stay when i could have abandoned him to his fate it did not take long for me to love him for the man he truly was yes i loved severus snape i will always love him he was the other half of myself i always felt missing with him my life was complete despite all our differences and all our difficulties severus was not perfect but he was my husband and that was always enough for me she brought the rose to her lips and then gently laid it on his coffin he was surprised to see the silvery flash of her order of merlin wrapped around it rest well my love and find the peace you so richly deserve i love you severus was stunned to silence as apparently were the rest of the observers he never expected such a stirring eulogy from the woman he treated like a nuisance for three years especially after what he d just seen of the events on their second anniversary how could she still love him were the few things he did for her enough to capture her heart what did he do to deserve her black was silent again as he lost himself in thought he remembered the first time he noticed her as a grown woman it was her near the beginning of her seventh year they were in the great hall for lunch and she was apparently running late she skidded into the room and hurried to the gryffindor table just moments before dumbledore gestured for the food to appear her face was flushed from running and she was panting from the exertion his eyes were involuntarily drawn to her chest where the sudden reality of her growth impinged upon his consciousness for six years he d taught her and like the other students she was a name granger nearly faceless sexless and totally without discerning features to him she was a mature brain in the body of a child suddenly it hit him that the child had grown up she was almost a woman she and her faithful companions were swiftly approaching the time when they would leave to join the adult world he hadntfelt any stirrings of desire by that point he was far too disciplined and she was still too young but he knew it was only a matter of time before she began to intrude upon his thoughts in ways none of his other former students had the marriage law was a nightmare dream come reality his stupidity had turned it from possible dream to indisputable nightmare so lost was he in his thoughts that he failed to see the smirk on his mischievous companion face nor did he notice the change of scenery when severus finally looked around it was to find himself outside on a path he recognized as leading up to the snape family manor hermione and his former self were already there walking up toward the house he was speaking quietly to her explaining the history of the place and his family heritage her small hand rested on his arm while they walked and he remembered fondly the day and all that happened it was early in their marriage only a few months had passed and he had yet to distance himself from her as a result of the ministry rejection he d forgotten this day and found himself grateful black finally decided to show him something he did right you re welcome snape i have to admit that even you had your moments thanks he replied dryly no charge the two ghosts watched as the couple entered the house and began exploring it had been years since severus visited his ancestral home he hated his family and the way they raised him so he avoided contact with them as much as possible one of his unhappiest memories was of the day they found out he was a deatheater the only thing that would have made them happier would have been if he announced his marriage to some pureblood like bellatrix black he shivered at the thought even he when consumed by the darkness in his soul found her far too psychotic to contemplate being with having hermione in the house with him served to help a number of old wounds in his heart begin to heal she dragged him from room to room demanding to know who the paintings were why certain things were there and if he liked the d cor through her eyes he began to see the possibilities for making the house into a home for them and their children at the time he never imagined he would come to treat her so badly and still had hope his secret desires would come true perhaps black was right maybe he was in love with her when they married could he have been a bigger git hermione flung open the doors to the ballroom and immediately gasped at its immensity lighting the room was a large intricate crystal chandelier the room was spotless and in the dim light she could see the shine of gold accents and the brilliant colors of painted ceramic on the ceiling the floor was gold veined marble and had been polished to perfection she could see herself reflected in the stone tall golden archways lined the room behind which stood alcoves that held statues of mythological figures she recognized apollo and hermes and quickly examined the rest of the room for a common theme it appeared severus family had a fascination with the greeks my great grandfather built this for his wife she visited athens as a child and was enraptured by the architecture and rich history of the city this was his gift to her she loved to dance and he thought this would be the perfect gift to show her how much he cared for her severus smiled gently at his young bride his dark eyes intense my family has always been reticent about expressing our feelings in words but actions often speak louder anyway were your parents like that unfortunately not my great grandparents were around before grindewald and the great wars that followed they did not have the same type of morality that my immediate family came to possess i am not the only member of my family to support the dark lord did were they proud of you immensely he smirked they would have hated you i find myself experiencing a large amount of satisfaction at the thought of them seeing you here knowing that you are now part of our family oh why thank you severus i glad you brought me here he held out his hand shall we continue snape manor was the home to three house elves that made sure the house and the grounds were well cared for severus was pleased to see the rooms spotless and well maintained and the gardens lush and green the joy in his wife face grew as they explored and it warmed his heart to see how easily she was accepting him and his heritage he forgot about all the reasons for keeping his distance and as the day progressed grew more comfortable in her presence around noon they stopped in the gardens and had an impromptu picnic one of the house elves brought a basket of food out and set up a nice spot for them to dine in the midst of his mother rose garden they chatted as they ate relaxing in the warm sun and enjoying each other company even then he could see the faint sparks of love in her eyes and the way she glowed when he smiled at her or touched her in any way he remembered how it took all of his stern control to behave as a gentleman surrounded by roses of all colors she reminded him of a nymph with her unruly mane of honey brown hair and ivory skin her cheeks were flushed with happiness and it was all he could do not to take her right there in the garden instead he leaned forward and gave her a gentle kiss which rapidly grew passionate as a result of her unbridled enthusiasm he was the one that broke away to suggest they continue their explorations severus yes hermione why dontyou live here i mean during the summer i know you have to live at hogwart during the school year he was silent for a moment trying to figure out how to explain he decided this was one of those rare occasions that called for straightforwardness i ve always hated it here my childhood wasntexactly happy no i am not going to rehash it to satisfy your bloody curiosity and i have never felt the desire to stay here for any length of time will i mean what about now his eyes captured hers as he took her hand i believe someday i may be able to get past those memories to create newer and far more pleasant ones i i d love to help you with that severus she was blushing furiously her eyes shy and uncertain any memory with you in it will be a pleasant one hermione he gently kissed her hand at her shiver he became slightly concerned perhaps we should go inside now it getting late would you could we watch the sunset together please her imploring gaze was irresistible and he found himself agreeing to sit with her in the gazebo at the center of the back yard her hand slipped into his and he decided to keep it there while they watched the sun go down she moved closer as night fell and by the time the stars were out she was snuggled warmly in his embrace her hair smelled of strawberries i ve always dreamed of living in a place like this i guess all girls want a fairytale castle complete with their handsome prince and beautiful ballroom thank you for bringing me here severus i am no prince hermione he could feel her smile i know but i ve never really been the type of girl who yearned for some blond haired blue eyed man with the body of an adonis and the mental capacity of a statue she looked up at him you are far better i i could think of you as my prince quite easily her shy blush made her even more beautiful and he found himself lowering his head to meet her lips in a gentle kiss he felt her hand slide up his neck into his hair and her body shifted so she was at a better angle for extended kissing she evidenced no desire to stop and he was not so much of an idiot that he was going to reject such a gift he was contemplating deepening the kiss when she hesitantly touched her tongue to his lips her action began a duel of tongues that lasted until they were giddy and breathless he ran his fingers through her silky hair amazed at her beauty and how willing she seemed to show him affection his lips curved into a real smile at the thought of her with him maybe we should go inside she suggested still breathless would you like that very much shall i carry you i ll come with you however you want severus carry me if you will or i will follow on my own if i take you into the house i want you to understand i have no intentions of stopping until we reach my room good that means i wonthave to go looking for it hermione take me to bed severus there was nothing else that needed to be said severus was a dutiful husband and obeyed his wife not that it was difficult and too her to his room he smirked as he carried her across the threshold remembering something about it being some muggle wedding tradition a quick flick of his hand lit the fireplace and he surprised her by setting her down on the rug in front of it perhaps we could indulge in a drink with a snap one of the house elves brought the wine he d set aside earlier that day she was amazed at the extent of the wine cellar and the knowledge that many of the bottles were very well aged and from all over the world the vintage he chose for this evening was a light dessert wine and with it came a small tray of cakes tarts and fruit instead of sitting across from him as he expected hermione came and sat between his legs her head resting on his chest again he could feel warmth spreading throughout his body at her soft touch he never noticed that his fingers were gently stroking her neck until she sighed with pleasure the second smile of the evening came to his face as he thought of a wonderful way to reduce his beautiful young wife to jelly in his arms the soft stroking became firmer as he began to rub her neck in earnest another sigh prompted him to roll her onto her stomach where he could have better access to her back it was time his wife discovered how truly talented his hands were severus always knew massage could be one of the most sensual experiences of one life but it wasntuntil his wife was sighing and moaning beneath the clever ministrations of his hands that he realized what a turn on it could be for him as well the mere thought that he was making her feel good enough to verbally express herself was almost as erotic as more sexual activities it wasntlong until he could stand it no further and began to seduce her wholeheartedly her passionate response made it all worthwhile she spent the night in his room and it was to his great pleasure that he woke up the next morning with her body twined about his the next several days were spent in a state of loving bliss as they grew closer and he let his impulses take charge for a change she loved it and returned the favor with the prodigious enthusiasm of youth it was one of the happiest times of his life so why d you go and bugger it up snape frowned he almost forgot the annoying mutt was nearby the ministry i was reminded of the fact that our marriage only existed because of that bloody law and it i couldntaccept the fact that she was condemned to be with me for the rest of her life why the hell not it seems to me she was quite happy to be condemned shut it black she was too young to know what she wanted hermione never had the chance to be with anyone other than myself how was she supposed to know better snape in case you never noticed hermione was always far more mature than the rest of the students i think she had a very good idea of what she wanted maybe i wasntso sure black maybe but i really do have to give you some points for this little trip how come you never did it again three months later was my first rejection from the ministry after that i was obsessed i see well at least she had this much severus sighed gazing at his wife she deserved so much more well let hope she gets it again he looked up as if he heard something dog whistle black ha ha nope severus but we do have to go where do i ever tell you that it a surprise reality wavered again and suddenly they were back at the school the patronus is one of the more challenging defensive spells to master but once you know it you ll never forget it and it can definitely come in handy when facing any number of dark creatures they were standing in the defense against the dark arts classroom watching harry potter teach what appeared to be a class of sixth year ravenclaws and hufflepuffs focus and strength of will are the vital components of this defense first you need to have a happy memory to use as the source of positive energy for the spell second you have to be able to bend your will toward pushing that energy outward in a defensive shield against you and whatever you are fighting the patronus will last as long as you concentrate on it but it can be very draining if you hold it for too the door slammed open and a slytherin fifth year rushed into the room professor potter all eyes turned to the panting student professor snape infirmary said to come get you harry was running toward the door before the boy could finish amanda watch the class i ll be never let it be said that albus dumbledore moved like an old man his quick reflexes revealed themselves as he stepped aside just in time to avoid a collision with the boy who lived smiling indulgently he waved aside harry stammered apology and motioned for him to continue do not keep your lady waiting harry women are notoriously short tempered at this point in their lives i do believe i can take it from here without another word harry dashed for the infirmary thinking only of the young woman that meant to him more than his own life he d always loved her but the past six months brought them closer together and wound her even more tightly around his heart he hated knowing that there would always be a hint of sadness in her eyes as a result of severus snape death but he resolved he would do every thing in his power to put as much joy there as possible the infirmary was oddly quiet when he ran in to the room causing him to frantically search about for madame pomfrey and the woman he loved dear god what if something happened to her a screened off area caught his attention and he approached it hesitantly almost afraid to see what was inside what if something went wrong with the delivery what if something happened to the baby he paused what if something happened to hermione mr potter get in here if you have any desire to be here for the birth of hermione child the mediwitch grabbed his arm and pulled him into the enclosed area the sound of his beloved cries of pain could be heard as soon as he crossed the threshold he rushed over and grabbed her hand i here love just relax everything will be all right harry james potter you relax ahhhh you bastard i hate men all of you her hand clung to his in a crushing grip everything is not all right i ahhhhh harry was shocked at the way she was behaving but remembered hearing stories about women in labor and how some reacted to the pain since hermione and snape daughter was the product of two very powerful wizards the mediwitch had deemed it necessary to perform the birth without the pain relief spells at the time hermione scoffed at the need for such obviously she had no idea what she was getting herself in to the gentle tones of madame pomfrey voice penetrated her screams you need to push hermione i ll tell you when she ready to come out but you have to help her severus watched in wonder as his wife struggled through the process of giving birth to their daughter it was extremely painful he saw but when everything was finished she had a glow to her he d never seen before her eyes sparkled with emotion as she beheld her newborn daughter hello seryna hermione whispered gently rocking the infant she looked up harry i d like you to meet my daughter seryna elizabeth snape hi seryna he said love already beginning to shine in his eyes this was the child of the woman he loved how could he not love her as well severus was shocked that his wife gave their daughter his name he was relieved beyond measure that the family name would continue with his and hermione child but had honestly expected her to choose granger for the girl there was far less baggage attached to his wife maiden name he examined the baby she was small smaller than snape expected her to be curly black hair adorned her head and it was with great relief that he noticed her nose was that of her mother the girl eyes opened as the ghost of her father stood over her and the ice blue eyes of his mother met his he was almost knocked to the ground from the surge of love he felt for the child sirius soft voice broke his reverie it time to go snape this then was it his daughter was born and he d been given the chance to look at her before moving on to the afterlife he regretted the fact that he would not be there for her first steps her first word the first time she peppered her parents with questions on everything under the sun intelligence shone in her eyes and he knew she was going to grow up to be an extraordinary child like her mother madame pomfrey gently took the child and set her into the bassinet dumbledore had brought from the manor hermione was falling into an exhausted and well needed sleep harry took the chair near her bedside and watched her as she slept severus stood on the other side also watching his wife it was time to let her go his position opposite potter was more than symbolic he was about to cross over into the unknown of the afterlife while the young man stayed behind to care for the only woman he ever loved the dark wizard reached out to touch his wife cheek afraid that his hand would pass right through her he was surprised when her soft warmth met his touch and she smiled contentedly in her sleep he bent over to kiss her forehead goodbye love i ll miss you but i promise we ll see each other again take care of our daughter and let po harry love you like you deserve to be loved never doubt that i love you and our daughter he turned to face sirius i suppose you know what to do next wait for a moment sirius pointed hermione eyes were open and she was staring at the place where her husband stood severus she whispered i love you he touched his lips to hers i love you hermione he straightened all right black let get this over with the former gryffindor ignored him to stare at his godson severus followed his gaze to see harry take hermione hand and kiss it gently he savagely crushed the surge of jealousy at the sight mione she turned her head yes harry mione i know this has been a really difficult time for you but i d like you to hear me out before you say anything her gaze turned curious to his somber demeanor you know that i love you i ve loved you for as long as i can remember but never realized it until the battle in the ministry of magic our fifth year if i hadnthad the threat of that insane bastard over my head i would have done everything in my power to court you like an incredible woman like you deserves harry shhh mione listen i know you loved sn your husband and i know you always will i can never take his place in your heart and in all honesty i ve never expected to all i ask is for the chance to spend the rest of my life caring for you and seryna and to show you the love i have felt for you these past years i know you will never love me the way you loved him but i d like the chance to win at least a small part of your heart he held up a small box this belonged to my mother hermione there is only one woman in this world i ever wanted to wear it and she is sitting right in front of me he opened the box to reveal a gleaming gold and sapphire ring topped with a small diamond marry me hermione let me love you for the rest of your life agony wrenched through snape at the thought of losing his wife but he pushed it aside to wish for her happiness not knowing what prompted him severus bent over to whisper in her ear you are free hermione i want you to be happy and if being with potter accomplishes that then you have my blessing it appeared that on some level she heard him because her face relaxed and she reached out with a shaky hand to take the ring her smile was more brilliant than the sun i d love to harry he lunged forward to capture her lips in an ardent kiss and the two gryffindors clung to each other desperately as they spoke their feelings without words that was the last thing snape saw before a brilliant white light surrounded him then everything went dark hey snape wha his eyes fluttered open and immediately shut at the horrifying sight before him i guess you were right padfoot he really does get up on the wrong side of the afterlife wake up i am in hell he muttered james potter smiling face was burned into his eyelids as the first thing he saw upon moving beyond death he sat up glaring at anyone nearby his scowl faltered when he saw lily the beautiful gryffindor stepped forward smiling kindly welcome to the afterlife severus she extended a delicate hand to help him up thank you he murmured james clapped him on the back so severus how life been treating you funny potter you are the consummate comedian see i told you death did nothing to improve his disposition leave him alone sirius he has enough to deal with hello severus remus lupin strolled up looking as if he just finished a vacation in the caribbean that was one of snape greatest regrets his inability to save lupin in the final battle he freely admitted that he despised the annoying werewolf but he never felt the sheer unadulterated hatred for him that the other marauders earned during the past few years they had developed a tentative peace and honestly severus did not have a great deal of anger left now that the majority of his tormentors were dead remus was guilty by association more than anything he nodded politely remus all right now that we ve had roll call let get down to business james suddenly showed the brisk competence he was known for at hogwarts he turned to snape you have a choice to make severus and what you do will have a great bearing on the lives of several people harry potter hermione gra snape her daughter yourself and albus dumbledore to name a few i want you to consider carefully before you make your choice because once it is made there no going back what the bloody hell are you babbling about potter i should think that would be obvious to one of your incredible intellectual gifts oh bloody hell james just tell him already james smirked at the indignant werewolf but decided to get on with it i imagine snape that you re wondering why you are here and what we have to do with your little excursion into the past your perception is astounding a rude gesture followed his response lily gave her husband a stern look before continuing the conversation herself severus we wronged you in the past rather severely unfortunately there nothing we can do to change that far too many things have occurred since then but we can do something about the present it been nine months since i died lily i hardly call that the present actually severus that not completely true what do you mean he eyed her suspiciously what you have seen was a glimpse of not only your past but your future as well that impossible not here it isn t we were given the chance to show you what will happen if things do not change from the point of your death it will happen and in some way has happened but that can be altered explain remus lupin gazed at him earnestly severus time does not function the way you understand it within certain boundaries things may be changed in order to alter what shadows of the future come to pass it is possible for there to be a time where you do not die what are you saying oh bloody hell snape he saying that you have a choice you can move on to the afterlife which will not necessarily include us or you can go back and change things we can send you back to the moment before you made your fatal choice with all the memories you have gained from this experience sirius eyes burned into him you could make things better for both you and your wife and your child severus stared at them in shock you must decide quickly severus we can only hold this ripple static for so long in a short time it will be too late to change your fate what happens to her hermione yes hermione you mangy cur what happens to her after seryna is born if i dontgo back sirius looked surprised at the question uh she and harry get married and they raise seryna together hermione figured out that she loved harry the instant he walked into the room to be there for her daughter birth and they are happy together harry treats seryna as his own child and sticks to his promise to care for the both of them four years later they decide to have a child of their own and little seryna gets a baby brother a year later hermione and harry continue to visit your grave every year on the anniversary of your death and hermione takes to keeping a journal of her words to you instead of talking to your spirit years later when she tells seryna about her father she hands over the diary and your daughter begins writing in it both children attend hogwarts seryna is sorted into ravenclaw and turns out to be the most brilliant witch of her generation she even beats her mother newts by one james sirius potter is sorted into gryffindor to no one surprise and he too takes after his mother in intelligence but has his father flair for athletics beyond that the future gets fuzzy but that the approximate shape of things to come i see snape thought hard on one hand he could have the opportunity to go back and make things right with hermione he honestly felt that if given the chance he could make hermione far happier than potter ever could but he also knew she would have to be willing to let him there was no guarantee he would succeed and he might just muck up her chances for the happy future sirius foretold did he love her enough to give her up he shook his head giving up the woman you love is a fallacy perpetuated by the cheesy romances far too many of the girls in his house read love to him has always been a willingness to do anything for the object of one affections including fight to keep them in one life he d buggered things up enough that he was under no illusions about the fight he was going to have to put up to win over potter the image of her tear stained face came to mind she loved him far more than he deserved and he had done nothing over the past three years but push her away for the sake of his pride he hurt her the least he could do was show her how much he truly loved her love would be letting her go if she decided she wanted to be with potter despite all that it was a hard choice was he risking her future if he chose to go back or was he chickening out if he took the safe route and gave her up to potter he thought back to their wedding to their first night together to the trip to alexandria to the breakfasts they shared and the discussions they had it was too much to ask for either of them to give up for her to never have a chance to experience again the least he could do was make things up to her he turned to look james potter in the eye and made his choice warning if you were happy with the idea of harry and hermione getting together and living happily ever after stop reading now and pretend the story sirius told snape in the last chapter is the epilogue i honestly think either scenario is equally possible remember this is in the hg ss section for a reason i hope you enjoy the continuation of this little angst fluff fest you know i hadntactually thought of the it a wonderful life parallel of course i have to say that my subconscious controls my mind through my muse and i am but a slave to its every whim yes i am evil but you have to admit it really fun thanks again guys your comments have been very encouraging i can only hope my other stories get this great of a response he glanced at his notes to double check the amount and then measured it out carefully in a small glass tube he paused thinking briefly that hermione would have loved to be here for this and at that moment he realized she was too much a part of his life to push away he would apologize for his behaviour later perhaps he would plan a nice evening dinner followed by a non ministry required seduction the last time he did something like that she responded extremely well he should have continued the past year would probably have been a lot more pleasant he tipped the vial severus hand shot out before he thought catching the dragon blood before it made contact with the potion his hand stung from the heat but he was able to quickly move over to the sink and wash the blood away several bandages and a burn treatment potion later found him ready to go speak with his wife i sorry hermione he was struck with a sudden urgency as the memories of his trip to the afterlife came flooding back seeing her weeping angry enchanting alluring he had to speak with her he had to apologize for what he said before she left forever severus ran to their quarters stopping only to reset the wards as he entered he could tell she wasnt there the instant he crossed the threshold potter she was in potter rooms he moved to dash off but then came to the realization that he needed to find some way to convince her he was serious about starting over a crazy idea popped into his head and he burst into her rooms without a second thought severus frantically searched the closet for the box he knew his wife kept since they were married he knew he would need something rather spectacular to get her attention if he was going to persuade her to actually listen to him and give him another chance maybe going with his feelings for a change would be a good thing suddenly the gleam of polished oak caught his attention pushing a pile of linens aside he smiled as he recognized the hope chest hermione mother gave her the day after their wedding he pulled it out and quickly opened the lid there they were the binding cords perfect he hoped it worked it had to work she would have to pay attention to him now his eyes slid past the objects of his search to take in the rest of the contents he was shocked to see how many things his wife saved as keepsakes her flowers the alter candles there was even a small photo book with the pictures the creevy boy had taken he picked it up to glance inside she was so beautiful perhaps he could suggest they look through it sometime to remember the wonderful night that was their wedding better yet maybe he could take her back to paris for a second honeymoon the trip to harry room was blessedly short and uninterrupted by the annoying brats albus referred to as students he pounded on the door and waited impatiently for potter to answer the door opened professor snape good evening professor is it safe to assume my wife is here potter eyes turned cold i dontthink that any of your concern right now snape severus pushed past the irate gryffindor to step into the room hermione sat near the fire looking at him in astonishment her eyes were red rimmed and puffy from weeping but she had forced her face into a neutral expression severus despite the neutrality her voice was cold as ice he winced this was not the time for slytherin subtlety he realized only gryffindor candor would do he dropped to his knees in front of her forgive me he whispered his head bowed i should never have said what i did i i lost my temper hermione and took it out on you in the worst way i should have stayed away until i had myself under control but i how could he explain that he despaired for her and how he hated the ministry for forcing her to marry him how could he tell her that wanted to skiv off the meeting so he could stay with her forever how could he tell her he would cherish any child of theirs simply because it was hers severus shhh please listen to what i have to say i know i have given you little reason to value my words over the past three years but please let me say what i have to before you speak hesitantly she nodded he pulled out the cords three years ago we made oaths to each other that only one of us has kept i swore so many things that i honestly meant but i got so wrapped up in getting that bloody law repealed that i forgot how important you are to me he took her hand and deftly wrapped the cords around them before she could object his other hand moved to touch her ring i give to you my soul and my dreams as my promise for my love and devotion to you is without limit as you walk your path in life i ask that you walk beside me tears sprang to her eyes i meant it hermione every word i lost sight of what was important because of my stubborn desire for a freedom i truly didntwant forgive me for how i ve treated you for how i ve spoken to you and never told you how much i care for you and want to be with you he raised her hand to his lips please give me another chance to say that hermione was shocked would be an incredible understatement her eyes were wide as they stared in disbelief at her husband a thousand thoughts raced through her mind and her emotions were a jumble of joy pain love hate hope and fear part of her wanted to fling herself into his arms and stay there forever but the rest of her was afraid of being hurt again and angry at what he d said and done to her admittedly he never apologized like this before but how was she to know this wasntjust a trick for some bizarre slytherin game her eyes darted around in search of harry bloody hell it appeared he left as soon as snape dropped to his knees harry knew the better point of valor was to take himself elsewhere he d seen the look in the dark wizard eyes as he came in and as much as it pained him to admit he knew the man had finally realized how much of an arse he had been this was what hermione always hoped for and what he always dreaded he loved her more than his own life and inside his emotions warred with each other over how he felt about this new development he wanted her to be happy but he wanted to be the one making her so that is why he left he could influence hermione far too much with a simple twitch of his eyebrows this was her choice seeing that harry was no longer in the room hermione knew he was giving her the not so subtle message that he was not going to help her make this decision in light of his feelings for her it made sense it was always difficult seeing him and knowing that he suffered from what amounted to unrequited love and the past several years have only served to make her appreciate him even more they could be happy she knew but what about severus hermione was overwhelmed by her husband words and actions and uncertain as how to proceed her baby needed a father but she wanted that father to be a loving caring man instead of a moody bastard who used people for his own purposes her skin crawled as she remembered the dozens of times he used her and cast her aside for his own pleasure his words of only a short time ago echoed in her mind her eyes grew cold severus i appreciate the melodrama of this display of yours but i honestly find it hard to believe a single word you have to say you ve treated me like an intruder in your life for three years and i cantsee how you can say you want another chance when you never even tried to make things work the truth in her words stuck him like a blow to the heart hopelessness washed through him as he realized he was too late now he d buggered up everything at least if he died she could move on with fewer regrets and make a happy life with potter now she was tied to him and still subject to that bloody law he should have stayed dead hermione was surprised to feel a surge of anguish as she saw the light in his eyes die part of her rejoiced at the thought of him finally knowing how she felt but it wasntin her nature to be vengeful this had grown beyond just her and severus there was another factor now she couldntjust walk away her child deserved this chance he stood up to leave and the binding cords fell slack and dropped to the floor in his mind they fell in slow motion coming to rest in a tumbled mass on the floor symbolic of their broken marriage he turned away shoulders slumped something she d never seen before and head hung with despondency even after the rejections of the ministry he had never seemed so broken she couldntdo this severus he stopped severus i i dontknow what to do honestly after three years of hell you are finally offering me a glimpse of what i used to think was heaven i need time to process all this to think about what i want and what i think you are capable of giving give me some time i will wait for you for eternity hermione an instant later he was gone the next few days were agony for both severus and hermione after a great deal of thought she decided to move out of the dungeons until she decided one way or another if she was going to stay with him even if she decided to give him a chance she needed to be away from him while they tried to work things out headmaster dumbledore was very understanding about the situation and gave her a set of rooms halfway between the dungeons and harry quarters near gryffindor it hurt snape to know he had alienated his wife so severely but he understood her need for space the two avoided each other while she considered his request and she spent a lot of time at harry s talking about the past and trying to figure out her own feelings while her husband tried to give her space to think and deal with her hurt and anger harry spent a great deal of time holding his best friend in his arms as she soaked his shoulder with her tears several days later harry decided it was time for his best friend to act mione he gently pushed her away to catch her eyes mione i know he hurt you very badly but you cantkeep him hanging like this you need to decide if you re going to let him go or give him another chance he deserves that at least i know harry i guess i just putting it off because i afraid afraid of what love i afraid that if i let him back into my life that i ll just get hurt again harry brushed her cheek tenderly it a risk mione it will always be a risk but as much as i hate to say it i think he being sincere i honestly think he finally realized how badly he buggered things up with you she gave him a teary smile i thought i was supposed to be the voice of reason in this friendship i figured i needed to try something different i suppose it not too bad he gave her a sly smile i still think being the impulsive one is better harry he laughed go talk to him mione tell him how you feel she gave him a quick hug before getting up to leave thanks harry hermione found her husband in his potions lab working on something she didnt recognize making a mental note to ask him about it later she waited until he reached a stopping point before clearing her throat he whirled to face her severus hermione was that a hint of uncertainty in his voice i ve thought about what you said it was silent for a few moments and and i ve come to a decision he swallowed here we go i think i d like to give it one more try his head bobbed resignedly i understand i severus eyes flew up to meet hers in shock what did you say i said yes severus you can have your second chance one month for each year we were together but i have some conditions he nodded unable to believe what he was hearing first of all i want you to treat me how you re honestly going to treat me during the rest of our marriage i dontwant you to romance me if it means going back to cold silences and hostile words after the time is up second behave how you want to behave not how you think i want you to i know you re a sarcastic snarky bastard but i knew that years ago when i decided to marry you dontchange on my account she stepped closer and finally i want to know how you truly feel you re not protecting me when you hide your emotions so dont think you need to stifle everything when we re alone i want you to be comfortable with me and hiding behind the evil deatheater mask is not going to help us learn to be together for the long term got it he nodded still stunned that she was willing to give him a chance hermione watched while a multitude of emotions passed behind her husband eyes he was rarely this expressive usually only allowing anger far too often or tenderness almost never to appear this time he seemed curiously vulnerable she gave him an experimental smile to see how he reacted it shocked her to find herself wrapped in his embrace thank you he whispered against her hair this was a severus snape she would need time to get used to it was going to be very difficult far more than she imagined because of her own defensiveness built up over the period of three years he was being open with her and as such was vulnerable to being hurt for the first time in decades his willingness to risk himself spoke louder than words about his intentions perhaps this would work out after all would you join me for dinner hermione his rich velvety voice enveloped her in a warm cocoon of sound she looked up to catch his eyes i d like that severus where shall we go the dragon treasure perhaps really unless you have a better suggestion the uncertainty was back no severus that would be perfect i ve i ve always wanted to go there but she refused to start things off with recrimination for his past behaviour he wanted a second chance and she was determined to give it to him he understood the unspoken explanation anyway i apologize for that he gave her a smirk that made her knees weak i guess we ll just have to eat there every night for the next three months to compensate she laughed that will be unnecessary severus i sure you can make it up to me in other ways her face flushed as she realized what she was implying his rich laugh filled the room that my dear would be my pleasure chills shot down her spine at the sound of his wonderfully silky voice if he could bottle that she thought he d be richer than the rest of the wizarding world put together seduction in a bottle bloody hell to distract herself from the surge of conflicting feelings hermione looked over to see what her husband was working on she recognized most of the ingredients but had never seen them used in combination if she didntknow better she would think he was working on three different potions what are you working on she hesitantly wandered over eyes curious the all heal potion his voice was back to being distant and cold she sighed i see well i ll leave you to it then her hand was on the doorknob when his voice stopped her perhaps you would like to see what i have done thus far she whirled to face him surprised evident in her features are you going to stand there gaping at me or are you going to come over here and take a look this time his voice was sarcastic which honestly didntbother her as much as the cold and emotionless tone from earlier all minor considerations such as his voice and attitude became unimportant as he began to explain his research to her for the thousandth time she felt incredible admiration for the mind he possessed he was brilliant a genius in the subject of potions and herbology should be able to heal almost anything up to and possibly including a death wound i not sure about curing disease but it might be the first step on the road to finding a cure for lycanthropy her eyes turned sad and he knew she was thinking of her friend remus lupin he remembered how the werewolf had looked in his dream he walked over and wrapped his arms around her his voice was soft and smooth as silk i sure he in a better place now love wherever he is he is happy reunited no doubt with the rest of the mauraders he smirked right now i imagine he is the voice of reason as black and potter plot to play practical jokes on the other spirits her laughter wiped all traces of grief from her features i could see that she turned to face him thank you severus i just wish i wish i could have saved him too hermione he hugged her close determined to enjoy every moment she spent with him bestowing a gentle kiss on her head he stepped back to continue their discussion i used the amoure potion because it enhances the effects of the other two and has the side effect of strengthening the spirit hold on the body sometimes people die because they give up the addition of a powerful love potion helps prevent that it makes them love life he nodded proud of her understanding exactly hermione stood there thinking for several minutes obviously mulling over what he told her severus watched her thinking of how beautiful she was and what a fool he d been ah well dwelling on it will not solve anything he found himself curious as to what thoughts were roaming around in that brilliant mind of hers perhaps he should ask her if she was interested in giving him a hand later but first they had a date he reluctantly dragged his attention away from studying his wife and took a glance at the clock they still had a few hours until dinner but he had preparations to make tonight needed to be special if he was going to convince her of his sincerity hermione i am truly enjoying our conversation but i believe there are some things i need to take care of before our date oh he could see her struggle with disappointment i understand i guess i ll uh go get ready before she could turn away he grabbed her arm and pulled her to him i look forward to seeing you this evening hermione he fought the urge to grin at the obvious affect his silky tones were having on her perhaps now would be a good time to test his godson assertion that women thrived on romance he hesitantly touched his lips to hers after their first year together and the fateful trip to alexandria they rarely kissed he now knew it was because of him but for years he believed it was because she despised him knowing how she felt made expressing himself a lot easier their kiss was tentative at first as each of them fought their own insecurities about the other but then hermione demonstrated her gryffindor side and pulled severus to her pressing her lips more firmly to his he automatically responded years of pent up passion and desire conquering his reticence to show his emotions a tentative touch of his tongue to her lips prompted her to open for him and the kiss deepened until they were locked in a passionate embrace he should have done this years ago severus reluctantly dragged himself away from his wife lips they were both out of breath and he felt a thrill of pleasure at the glazed look in her eyes lightly brushing her face with his fingers he stepped back she could see the wicked glint in his eyes we will have to continue this later my dear i do believe we both have some things to accomplish before this evening leaving her stunned and breathless in the middle of the lab snape strode out of the room toward his first of many stops albus dumbledore hermione found herself unable to move for several moments after snape left the room who was that and what did he do with my husband she wondered there were several points in their marriage when severus demonstrated the capacity for great passion but nothing like what she just experienced goodness if every kiss with him was going to be like that she was going to need a potion to combat dizziness shaking her head bemusedly she headed back to her chambers to select her clothes for tonight and see if she might be able to get a little help with getting ready ginny would want to know what she decided anyway so she might as well ask for her assistance severus meanwhile was waiting impatiently outside the headmaster office next to the gargoyle the memory of his wife face when dumbledore offered to mentor her for her potions mastery was burned into his mind and he decided now was the time to do something about it even if they chose not to stay together she deserved the chance he never gave her honestly he though about offering an apprenticeship to her this evening but he determined that would be a very bad idea she was correct having her as a student made it very difficult to think of her strictly as his wife he was not willing to put himself in that position again however albus was perfectly capable of giving her the training she wanted and deserved she had the potential to be one of the greatest alchemists that ever lived but she needed to master potions before getting there he hoped she would not think he was bribing her he paused come to think of it things would probably go better if he did not let her know about his involvement at all admittedly his slytherin instincts were telling him to take all the advantage he could get to win her back but the knowledge of his gryffindor wife let him to the realization that she would be angry with him for manipulating her desires to his purpose yes definitely do not tell hermione about his involvement the gargoyle suddenly hissed at him and then opened to reveal the spiral staircase to the headmaster office snape quickly made his way up the stairs unsurprised to see the headmaster waiting patiently for him severus my boy welcome lemon drop the potions master frowned no thank you albus i would prefer to keep my faculties about me for this conversation admittedly no one ever proved that albus dumbledore put mood changing ingredients in his lemon drops but snape wouldntput it past him the man was as sneaky as a slytherin for all his gryffindor tendencies what can i do for you then he got straight to the point as you are aware hermione has been studying to become an alchemist she has completed her training under flitwick for her charms mastery but is still lacking in potions he paused trying to phrase his request properly i have the capability to supervise her potions apprenticeship but i would prefer not to instead i believe she would be better off if you perhaps took care of it yourself albus actually looked surprised why do you refuse to take care of it yourself severus i do not believe it appropriate for her husband to be her mentor and supervisor for something so important whyever not such an arrangement is not uncommon in the wizarding world severus there will already be those who doubt her abilities for being what she is albus i do not need to exacerbate the issue by placing myself in that position she deserves far better than for people to think she got her mastery because she happens to be married to her teacher the older wizard nodded thoughtfully i see your point so you will do it albus scrutinized the younger wizard i find myself curious as to the timing of your request your wife finished her schooling over a year ago why did you say nothing when she was making her plans severus shifted uncomfortably let us say that i have experienced a revelation and leave it at that dumbledore smirked there is often a great deal of wisdom to be found when one is shown the truth did he know how was it possible that he knew snape frowned bloody dumbledore and his all knowing attitude thank you for that observation albus that does not answer my question the headmaster returned to his cheerfully smiling self of course my boy i would be quite happy to supervise mrs snape during her potions apprenticeship will you be telling her this evening er honestly i would prefer you tell her albus i do not want her to know of my involvement are you sure severus it would be better that way very well i will have a contract of apprenticeship delivered to your chambers later this evening i do believe i can make sure it arrives before dinner did he bloody know everything never mind he thought of course he does severus had wondered that for years and he was still convinced the headmaster had extendible ears or something equally intrusive spread around the castle thank you was all he said before whirling to exit the room once the potions master was gone albus dumbledore allowed himself a broad smile for the first time in two years he got the feeling things were going to work out for the potions master and his brilliant yet lovely wife perfect severus headed out to hogsmeade next intent upon completing the rest of his errands the most important one was taken care of now it was time for him to get the romantic trappings he always felt so disdainful about in the past he and hermione never really had the chance to date before getting married perhaps this was his chance to do things right despite the bloody marriage law a short time later severus snape found himself standing in the middle of hogsmeade wondering how the hell it was that people like harry potter managed to be romantic without making fools of themselves or hexing everyone in sight due to his position as head of slytherin he had the opportunity over the years to witness any number of young men trying to woo the object of their affections flowers trinkets chocolates of such things were romantic interludes made unfortunately it appeared that his vast collection of skills did not include romancing the woman he loved severus had always been very methodical it was a habit that served him well as a professor of potions and he saw no reason to change anything for task of wooing his wife the first item on his list was chocolates his wife had an incredible weakness for chocolate and as it was listed on draco romantic suggestion scroll he figured it wouldnthurt to pick some up upon arriving at honeyduke he realized how foolish that decision was who knew there was such a variety of chocolate in the wizarding world dark milk white with nuts without nuts and of a dozen different brands all mocked him and his lack of knowledge of hermione preferences bloody draco couldnthave been bothered to at least give him a hint of what she preferred damn it how was he supposed to charm her he winced at the very idea of being charming if he had no clue as to what her tastes were a quick call to the malfoy resulted in silence and he assumed the couple was busy bloody hell finally he picked the most expensive chocolate in the store maybe he d get points for effort knowing that women often likened expense to the amount of feeling next he moved on to madame malkin s hermione had been telling him for years that he needed to get new robes he refused not because he couldntafford it but because he hated shopping with a passion now he found himself at the tender mercies of that psychotic madwoman in order to please his wife she cooed and ahhed about far too many styles of robes that all looked the same to him this one had a subtle patter woven into the fabric that one was made of the finest silk and would shine under moonlight bloody hell no the one over there was faced with a deep green that was almost black and could be reversed for double duty which would he prefer would he like a stole with that how about something less plain for his underrobe by the time he was done it was a miracle madame malkin had not exploded from his wrath never again he swore the next time hermione would come with him and pick out what she liked as long as it was black and serious his stop at gringott was the quickest and easiest one short trip to his vault left him with a small jewelry case filled with his mother jewelry and a pouch full of galleons he looked at the list again perfume draco was insane he wasntabout to purchase his wife perfume what the bloody hell did the boy think he was love was not making oneself look like a poofter for the sake of one companion hell no next item lingerie yes he could definitely swallow his pride in order to reap the rewards later however now was not the time for such a bold move later walks in the park sex on the beach watching the sunset that went over really well he remembered picnics swimming in the lake under the stars what was this list the complete guide to draco and ginny romantic lifestyle good suggestions but not for now what else was there severus wandered through hogsmeade deep in thought something was missing hmmm maybe something would occur to him if he turned his mind to another topic meanwhile he could just drop by ex libras for a short while and look around maybe he could find a book on romance that was not too sappy and pathetic mr boek greeted him as he walked through the door he gave the bespeckled old man a curt nod and headed back to his favorite section mere moments after beginning his perusal of the stacks he was lost in the world of books all uncertainties gone from his mind while her husband wandered around hogsmeade hermione snape was standing in front of her wardrobe trying to figure out what to wear ginny and draco unavailable so she found herself with no one to advise her she didntwant anything too formal nor did she want her clothes to be revealing this was the first date they d had in years and she wanted to make it special but was not about to mislead him as to his chances with her truth be told she found it highly unlikely that severus was going to change enough for her to want to stay with him honestly it wasntthat she wanted him to change she just didntwant to be an intruder in her own chambers barely tolerated by the man who swore to walk beside her through the path of their lives he was a solitary man however and her presence was an intrusion to his peace maybe she should just leave now unfortunately the memory of the joy in his eyes when she agreed to give him a chance haunted her it was like he d finally opened his soul just a touch and let her see the brilliance within for that alone she was willing to dare the hurt of his rejection his rather dramatic and truth be told romantic demonstration of his love was the other reason she refused to walk away she loved him and had wanted him to return that love for years now that he seemed to be doing so seemed to be sincere how could she not give him the chance he requested that was why she needed to put her anger aside and approach this as an opportunity now if she could only figure out what to wear i d suggest the blue dress she whirled harry what are you doing here harry was lounging in the doorway regarding her with an amused expression i thought you might need some input seeing as ginny and draco are in greece i guess i ll have to do hermione smiled at him gratefully you re the best harry i know his impish grin told her he was joking so you think the blue dress she pulled the one he spoke of out and examined it isntit a bit matronly for a date mione trust me there nothing matronly about that dress but it s just because it has a high neck doesntmean it made for the elderly you should see how it clings to that incredible figure of yours trust me snape sorry severus wontknow what hit him but i know it long but the skirt is full and very elegant i assuming he taking you to someplace nice she nodded wear that and the silver pendant pull your hair up but leave some tendrils hanging around your face you ll knock him dead harry i d kind of like to avoid becoming a widow before i find out what my husband is like when he not being a berk he laughed i not sure that possible mione but i sure he ll be quite attentive this evening he has a lot of reasons to want to make this work two rather big ones at the very least oh bloody hell er i haventtold him what what do you mean the baby i haventtold him about the baby for merlin sake hermione it his child too he has a right to know dont you think i know that lest your forget however he told me he d strangle any child of ours at birth i i not sure i ready to face that yet mione you have to tell him dontyou have an appointment with saint mungo next month uh yeah i was actually hoping ginny would go with me hermione jane snape harry james potter dontyou give that to me i ll tell him just i have to find the right time and that will be i ve given him three months at the end of it i ll make my decision if things go well and i think we can make it work then i ll tell him if not i going to america and he ll never know about the baby you cantdo that what about snape as much as i hate the greasy git i dontthink it right to just leave him and not let him know he a father he wontbe a father harry if i decide to leave it will be because i dontwant to have anything to do with him and i certainly wont want him around my child he wontcare anyway mione harry my mind is made up on this i know a spell that will help me conceal the pregnancy through the end of the fifth month after that i ll be either staying here with him or moving to the united states he sighed i think you re making a mistake mione he going to be livid when he finds out i know she replied softly but i want him to be honest about how he going to behave i dontwant an idealized form of severus i want the snarky sarcastic bastard that i married i figure we ll have to go on maybe one or two more dates before he relaxes and starts being himself again harry pulled her into his arms you know i ll be there for you no matter what mione just think about things before you make a final decision once you make it you know there will be no going back whatever happens i ll support you even even if it means watching me be happy with severus she asked in a small voice he pushed her chin up and caught her eyes all i have ever wanted for you hermione was for you to be happy if snape severus makes you happy then i will go out of my way to make peace with him so things are easier for you i will be more than thrilled to see you finally happy with the man you love hermione examined him noting the slight glint of pain in his emerald orbs it was always there she knew ever since she decided to marry severus her heart ached with the knowledge that her best friend loved her but was unable to be with her initially because of that bloody law and then because she fell in love with another why was her life so ruddy complicated hey he said smiling in the way that caused girls all over the world to swoon you need to get ready for your date dontworry about me love i ll be all right you enjoy yourself i ll just be out in the living area maybe i ll read something dont strain yourself he stuck out his tongue and then headed into the other room just for spite he picked up the largest book he could find no make that a tome book was far too inadequate to describe a periodical that looked to be at least a thousand pages long making himself comfortable he settled down to wait for his best friend to make herself beautiful snape in the meantime had gathered a respectable pile of books and was contemplating whether or not to buy them when a large volume caught his eye charms and potions methods of modern alchemy volume one by harrison habersham he smirked perfect hermione would love it especially if he got it with an autograph few in the world knew of the true identity of harrison habersham but severus was one of the privileged seeing as he was one of less than a dozen potions masters in the world and the premiere one in all of europe it made sense dumbledore would want him to proof the book it was a tragedy that nicolas flamel the other half of the writing team had passed on maybe he would have to give some serious consideration to the headmaster offer to let him co author his next manuscript without a second thought he took the large tome and piled it with his other selections a simple signature on the gringott note and he was on his way the clock tolled five and he realized how little time he had left to prepare for his date bloody hell he still had to get flowers and clean himself up it was a frantic for him severus snape that apparated back to the gates of hogwart half an hour later with a large bouquet of flowers in his arms since several of the flowers were magical shrinking it was not an option skulking through the back hallways and obscure staircases of the school was not the quickest way to get to his chambers but the last thing he wanted to do was let his wife see him before he was ready he never expected to run into potter bloody hell snape watch where you re going be careful with those potter they better not have taken any damage in case you forgot snape i am a seeker my reflexes are still good enough to prevent them from hitting the floor they re fine picking himself up off the floor he glared at the smirking gryffindor if i might get my flowers back potter i have a date to get ready for deep green eyes regarded him for a moment before the messy haired man responded orchids are her favorite not lilies bloody hell he didnthave time to go back to town and get another bouquet i think the greenhouse has a very nice selection of her favorite orchids taking a deep breath he looked severus straight in the eye why donti go and replace the lilies while you get ready severus was rooted to the floor in shock did he hear the man correctly he was going to help him woo the woman he loved i not doing it for you snape just get that straight now then who are you doing it for hermione she for some ungodly reason loves you and since she my best friend i want her to be happy more than i hate you your sentiment warms my heart potter the green eyes turned cold you had better not be toying with her snape or i ll make sure you regret it she deserves better than you and you should spend every moment you have with her thanking the fates that she was chosen to be your wife the last time severus saw the gryffindor radiate this much power was the day he defeated voldemort love the power he knew not interesting snape scowled i hardly think it is the fates i should thank potter i believe the ministry had a lot to do with it just treat her the way she deserves snape the past three years have been hell enough for a lifetime snape opened his mouth to retort but then remembered how close his wife was to the little prat for her sake and if he had any hope of winning her back he needed to treat the boy with courtesy at the very least fortunately she was not so foolish as to expect him to like the annoying gryffindor i thank you for the help po harry i would appreciate it if you would return to my rooms with the bouquet when you finish replacing the flowers er uh right i ll get right on that then see you in a bit sn severus severus didntwait to see if harry was as good as his word admittedly his slytherin instincts were telling him that he was a fool for trusting james potter son but he knew the boy had watched him during the past ten years if there was an epitome of gryffindor it was harry potter unlike his father he had honor and compassion from the beginning he doubted the boy man would do anything to sabotage his relationship with hermione she was his best friend and severus believed him when he said he only wanted her to be happy it was nearly an hour later when severus finished getting ready for his date he d chosen one of the black robes with the subtle designs to wear over his high necked tunic and black slacks his hair had been carefully washed with a concoction his wife made for him two years ago and it gleamed healthily as a result he wore it loose since hermione preferred it that way potter was waiting for him in the living area when he stepped out of the bedroom the boy no young man was avidly reading one of his texts on magical defense he smirked despite the fact that he chose not to be an auror harry still made sure he kept in fighting form not only was it for the benefit of his students but also in case he was called upon to pick up a wand and fight for the wizarding world again bloody gryffindor your father would be proud you know where the bloody hell did that come from harry looked up at him startled what do you mean despite the fact that you were one of my most annoying students and had a terrible habit of breaking every school rule in existence you turned out better than even albus expected your father would be very proud of you er thanks i always wondered what he would think of me especially after it was necessary harry accept it and move on he would have killed everyone you cared for starting with hermione the least you have done was save her but i believe even you can admit your deed accomplished so much more you uh thank you i guess things have changed a lot havent they indeed they have what a strange day it was to be speaking with his hated nemesis son in such a civil manner could his near death experience have affected him that much oh uh here i put the flowers over there he glanced over at the small two person table and was shocked to see a truly beautiful arrangement of flowers sitting next to a scroll bearing dumbledore seal good it was nice to see the headmaster understood this was a priority now he could relax he turned his attention back to the flowers potter did a far better job than the so called professionals at the shop severus had informed them of his need for flowers for his wife several questions and ten galleons later found him leaving the store with a bouquet of flowers supposedly geared to tell a woman she was loved roses carnations lilies and several other flowers he knew only as potions ingredients had been gathered together with assorted greenery and babies breath to produce something he hoped his wife would like this he knew she would love who knew the great harry potter was adept at arranging flowers the alarm chimed signaling it was time for him to leave and meet his wife he quickly thanked harry while rushing him out the door a quick check of his pockets assured him he had everything for the evening pouch galleons book flowers check and the scroll that was most important of all with one final look in the mirror to make sure he was prepared severus snape headed off to meet the woman he knew was more than worth his efforts it was time to begin making the last three years up to her okay okay i apologize for having hermione drink wine while pregnant since i have no children and am unable to it honestly never even occurred to me i have made the correction thanks to rebecca pierson for pointing that out alanfan i know what you mean i am very afraid that many authors will stop writing their ss hg fics because of book 6 not to mention all the other ships i interested in have no fear i have no intention of not continuing this fic to completion and perhaps writing others in the same ship as long as people will read i will write my little heart out billiejoe thanks for the support i know i enjoy the au fics just as much as the canon ones and even then writing completely canon is not possible unless you happen to be j k rowling we have no idea what she going to do in the next book i continuing all my fics because the original reason for writing them has not changed with the revelations of hbp i love her universe i love her characters and i thrilled beyond measure to have the opportunity to take them out for a spin rinny08 i have to agree snape is very challenging to write especially in a romantic context i trying very hard to make him realistically romantic without wussing out his character and making him in to prince charming not that i think i could i ask patience while waiting for my next chapter for this reason i dontwant to put up something that sucks so updates will probably be sporadic at best yes i am continuing this fic there will be a few more chapters followed by an epilogue for those of you joining us late in our program let me reiterate that not only is this story completely au alternate universe it is also the product of my diseased imagination before i read book 6 there will be nothing from hbp in this story thanks to all of you for continuing to read hermione started at the tentative knock and quickly ran to the mirror to double check her appearance she hadntbeen this nervous since the wedding a second stronger knock came shortly after the first and she found herself amused that severus seemed somewhat nervous himself it was rather endearing actually she opened the door and stepped back to let her husband into her chambers for the first time since the fight her breath caught in her throat as she noticed how handsome he looked severus had obviously gone all out to impress her his hair was soft and silky not oily as usual the robes he wore were brand new and incredibly well made they were black of course but had a subtle serpentine pattern woven into the fabric black tunic and pants as always with a white shirt peeking out from underneath completed the outfit she shivered there was something about severus being buttoned up from head to toe that excited her perhaps the prospect of undoing all those buttons why was he staring at her oh hello severus he pulled his hand out from behind his back and presented her with the most beautiful bouquet of flowers she d ever seen good evening hermione he said his velvety voice quiet you look stunning the smile that appeared on her face as a result of his compliment made her a thousand times more beautiful thank you severus he held out his arm shall we go my dear hermione hastily placed the flowers in a conjured vase and grabbed her wrap she took his arm it would be my pleasure the dragon treasure was one of the more exclusive restaurants in town catering mostly to the affluent purebloods of the wizarding world thanks to the marriage law places like it were becoming far friendlier to non purebloods which is the reason severus was finally willing to take his wife there he d considered it before but would not have done so during a time where she would be looked down on since then times had changed severus paused to watch hermione reaction as they stepped through the heavy golden gate into the courtyard the restaurant was several stories tall with walls of glittering stone and a slate roof several balconies hung off the side of the building and each held a small table two chairs and a bench to hold food and drink they were all protected from weather and after the war magical attacks lit with white tapers suspended in air at the center of the table was an arrangement of thirteen roses of varying colors inside the building was no less spectacular platforms were suspended throughout the large open dining room and held another romantic table setting for two the floor tables were larger and obviously designed for family dining the lights were dim and soft music played in the background the focus of this place was obviously on romance the awed look on his wife face at seeing the interiour more than made up for the ignominy of pandering to the romantic mindset it was a struggle part of him was pleased at her reaction and looked forward to doing other things like this in the future the other yelled at him to wake up and get the hell out of there before he became like potter she is my wife he reminded himself of all people in the world she deserved to have at least some of the romance he knew she desired the fact that she d never demanded it inclined him to be more willing to give it he pushed the small dissenting voice aside i do hope this meets with your approval my dear her chocolate eyes met his oh yes severus this is wonderful i wow i mean i never it s he smirked as she stumbled over her words raising her hand to his lips he kissed it gently i understand love i glad you like it her smile was more brilliant than the sun thank you the maitre d was very obviously excited at the prospect of having two war heroes as guests they were quickly seated in a small candlelit alcove away from the other patrons a waiter brought them a bottle of their finest wine and then melted into the background until they were ready to order hermione looked around her in amazement she found out early on in their marriage that her husband came from a long line of pureblood wizards gifted with enormous wealth he never flaunted it however a fact that relieved her to no end but when he decided to go all out he went all out to the point that she felt like a movie star or part of the british royal family severus had several suggestions on what she should try here and after careful consideration she decided to try the lemon basted game hen he looked somewhat surprised at her choice but waited until the waiter took their order to question her i thought you hated hen not really i haventreally had the chance to try oh no it was just that odd caramel basted stuff the house elves made that one time it was too sweet and far too sticky ah i see he was silent for a moment contemplating the woman that was his wife it was almost depressing to realize that for all the time they were together he still hardly knew her near death experience aside so uh what is your favorite food her eyes crinkled in amusement roast beef and vegetables actually mum makes the greatest and cherry pie she usually makes a cherry pie and roast beef with potatoes carrots and onions when i used to go visit them he didntremember the last time she d gone home to visit her family a surge of guilt struck him when uh when were you there last about a year ago it was while you were away at that potions convention during the summer you should go see them again i will soon i just i have some things to take care of before i go an uncomfortable silence ensued hermione knew she needed to tell her parents about the baby but she didntwant to answer their questions about severus while things were still uncertain with him until she made her decision to stay in england or move to america she felt it would be better to wait they d probably be upset but she thought they would understand if things went well however then maybe she could finally take her husband home with her her thoughts turned to her husband he was nervous it was odd seeing him uncomfortable like that he was trying so hard to be courteous and polite but in many ways it seemed so insincere like it wasnthim the severus snape she married was a sarcastic snarky bastard who could make even the strongest soul cringe at his comments she d grown used to it in school and had never expected it to change even after they were married now it was like he was completely different were his actions such a wakeup call to cause him to change so drastically the image of him threatening her and their unborn child flashed through her mind only to be savagely quashed now was not the time to bring up the past she could feel him gazing at her his dark eyes intense and full of something dare she hope it truly was love she gave him a shy smile and was rewarded with the slight smirk she d come to love so much good smiling severus was not something she was ready for regarding her speculatively severus picked up his wineglass and held it up for a toast to us my dear and to second chances she hastily raised her glass with him surprised at the toast to us a surreptitious wave of her wand reduced the liquid to a harmless grape juice but it was good nonetheless you know i really do appreciate this severus it an amazing place he smirked there is no need for thanks my darling i should have done this a long time ago out of curiosity why didntyou up until recently this was not a place i would have thought you would wish to visit less than a year ago it was under the ownership of edgar jugson and his family they were not as i sure you recall fond of non purebloods she nodded jugson was one of the death eaters that had been in the department of mysteries their fifth year he was injured in the final battle and the last she heard was still under guard at saint mungo criminal ward jugson son sold the property to ameldia hathran another pureblood who was a peripheral member of the order and now muggle borns are welcome more than welcome the success of the marriage law helped encourage other lesser families to frequent the establishment until it became popular again now that our blood is becoming more diverse places like this are beginning to spring up all over wizarding britain that good to hear it was times like this that hermione wondered if the muggle born pure blood marriage act was truly as bad as she sometimes thought it as much as she hated to admit it the wizarding world was still a bit behind the muggle world when it came to social reform the act was responsible for more social change in the wizarding world that almost any other single action for the past century it seemed change only occurred when something forced it she came from a world where arranged marriages were considered barbaric and a throw back to a less enlightened time they were not unusual here on the other hand especially for pure blooded wizards like her husband hence the law outraged him far less than her there was still a massive rift between pure bloods and muggle born and how they were treated so much so that she had briefly considered chucking it all to move back to the muggle world for good but she couldntdo it magic was too much a part of her fortunately the world was now changing hearing about things like this businesses finding a way to be more tolerant of non pure bloods excited her and forced her to consider that even the marriage law had its uses maybe that why dumbledore was so vehement that she stay with severus so did you agree with the marriage law severus eyebrow arched in surprise this was the first time she asked him that question since the fateful day in the headmaster office how did he reply to this looking into her guileless amber eyes he realized nothing but the truth would do he sighed not entirely i thought it was probably necessary although i think we could have accomplished the same thing by greater cooperation with other countries the biggest problem was the thinness of our blood it would have taken only three generations of breeding with witches and wizards of other countries to rejuvenate the bloodlines the marriage law was the quick means to the same end i can see that she looked at her hands i did the arithmancy you know before we got married and then later while you were fighting with the ministry about overturning the law i tried to predict whether or not you would succeed and you pretty much saw the result after that first group of kids two years ago there was no way the ministry was going to stop what they were doing it was working we were just the sacrifices to the greater good is that what it was hermione a sacrifice he almost sounded hurt in a way severus i didntgrow up prepared to make an arranged marriage i ll freely admit i handled it badly but how was i supposed to act he nodded true i am certainly not one to criticize your actions my dear there no need to dwell on the past severus then perhaps we should speak of the future this time her eyebrow was the one that arched it occurs to me that you and i have never actually discussed what our expectations are of each other i always believed that you wanted nothing more than the dissolution of our marriage but on four separate occasions you have discussed your desire for children with me what is it that you wish hermione i wish well i wish for whatever anyone wants love friendship to do something with my life i really donthave a plan anymore that got derailed three years ago but i cantsay that it a bad thing i still want to be an alchemist and hopefully someday i ll be able to accomplish it i do want kids and a husband who wants them with me i want to keep my friends and maybe be a bit closer to my family i guess i just want here you are sir madam severus found himself almost snarling as the waiter destroyed the unguarded bond between him and his wife the slightly sad and defensive demeanor she d worn for three years now returned and her thoughts were shuttered once again bugger the waiter left and hermione jumped onto a safe topic before her husband could say a word so did you ever find a way to make the lycanthropy potion he looked at her surprised hadnthe told her of his spectacular failure unfortunately not i do believe the last avenue of investigation produced very little in the way of hope i am honestly unsure as to what direction to go at this point i had an idea severus raised one elegant eyebrow indeed lycanthropy is more than just a treatable illness severus it a curse i ve been thinking about everything you taught be about the wolfsbane potion and i think i understand why it will only allow a werewolf to be docile but still allow them to change do tell he murmured it was truly amazing to watch her think i think we ve got a good handle on combating the mental illness that accompanies the change but we have not been able to do anything about the curse itself her eyes sparkled excitedly as she talked what if it cantbe cured by a potion what if we need a charm to counter the effects of the curse you mean we may need both he asked yes if we could find the magic responsible for the change and somehow neutralize it and at the same time give our test subject the potion that would rid his body of the disease perhaps he could be cured permanently this time or at the very least we might be able to make it so he can go for a few months without changing can you imagine what that would mean to people like lupin severus what it would mean to all of us he thought about it she had a very good point lycanthropy was very resistant to pretty much anything according to legend it was a magical disease created to curse a group of people who were responsible for the death of a great wizard wife was it too ludicrous to think that perhaps the solution could be found by another great wizard or at least a great wizard witch team he gave her a smirk i can imagine a great deal especially the late hours we will have to spend in the lab slaving over hot cauldrons and moldy tomes she was puzzled for a moment and then broke out into a beatific smile he was saying he wanted her to assist him do you mean it the hope and joy in her eyes made him feel the need to grin like a fool it struck him like a blow the he had wasted so much time lost in his own anger he cursed himself for an idiot as he realized he could have spent the past three years working with one of the most brilliant minds he d ever seen this was why he wanted to make things up to her she was perfect brilliant beautiful and soon to be the mother of his child yes darling i mean it the grin if anything grew broader and didntfade as the young couple continued to discuss possible avenues of research and experimentation by the time the final course came they had a tentative plan for approaching the unique problems involved in lycanthropic research hermione would spend most of her time researching even severus had to admit she was far better at it than anyone he knew including himself the larger reason however was the baby she hadnttold him but he decided to give her time to get used to him before he guided her to tell him either way however he wanted to keep her away from the more dangerous chemicals in the lab considering the lack of objections he figured she wanted the same thing as the couple consumed the main course each was lost in thought contemplating the future and the revelations of the evening hermione wondered at the changes in her husband it was nice to be able to chat with him without being afraid that he was going to get insulting and snide without warning but on the other hand she missed his snarky side he kept his wits honed to a razor sharp edge and it was at times amusing to listen to him filet someone as a result of their foolishness she hated being the target but even then she had to admire how clever he was he wasntthe head of slytherin for nothing maybe they could find a happy medium he could snark away but not overstep that line which turned things serious and she could learn to give as good as she got without being too defensive she d have to think on that later severus was thinking hard about the evening and how he thought he could accommodate his wife without sacrificing too much of himself he wasntbeing himself tonight that he knew he was just so afraid of saying the wrong thing and driving her away it was like he finally found something so precious and so valuable that he needed to go out of his way to be gentle lest it break or leave in her case she told him to be himself but truly who was that was he the horrible man who called her mudblood and threatened her unborn child or was he the man who took her to alexandria because he knew she would enjoy it he hoped it was the latter the idea that his father raised him to be the monster he remembered disturbed him how would he behave as a father should he let hermione go now so she can raise their child without him the baby would not be fatherless he knew potter would no doubt follow her wherever she went bugger the little bastard would probably be good at it too somehow he needed to find an equilibrium between his need for snideness and sarcasm and his tendency toward unnecessary cruelty hermione loved him for who he was if everything he saw was to be believed but until he found out who exactly he wanted to be it promised to be hard on both of them dinner was over far too quickly and before either of them knew it the table was clear of dishes and there was only silence between them maybe this would be a good time to broach the subject of her apprenticeship hermione yes severus i have you thought about what it is you want to do once you become an alchemist well first i will actually have to accomplish it but once i do i think i might like to go back to university and teach maybe do some research but first you need to apprentice with a potions master was he saying what she thought he was like like you the hope in her eyes made what he was about to do worth it no not like me he ignored her devastated expression i mean more like albus dumbledore he held out the scroll shakily she took the leather tube and opened it her jaw dropped as she read the parchment how how is this possible i thought albus has never taken an apprentice until now but why why me surely you can figure that out for yourself hermione thank merlin for the sarcasm i did you do this he shook his head albus made the offer because you deserve it my dear i am merely the messenger hopefully he was still as good at hiding the truth as he used to be not that it was a total lie albus would never have agreed to it if she wasntmore than qualified she eyed him suspiciously but then smiled when she saw what she was looking for this is wonderful i ve i cantbelieve this harry going to be so thrilled with those words his heart turned to ice in his chest all his efforts all the sacrifice to be what she wanted came down to this moment and all she could think about was potter suddenly the night turned bleak of course he should have expected her to fawn all over the bloody prat he was harry fucking potter the boy who lived to kill he who needed to be killed the man who was the bane of his existence merely because of his presence in the school and in his wife life he stood up abruptly and gazed at her eyes cold i sure mr potter will be more than happy to know you will have one more reason to stay at hogwarts perhaps you should go tell him the good news hermione looked at him puzzled by the change in demeanor and the ice in his voice is there something wrong severus not at all i believe it is simply time for us to leave the atmosphere has become disagreeable fire flashed in her eyes at his words disagreeable that ruddy bastard he invited her out to dinner lulled her into a false sense of security with pleasant conversation and then gave her the one thing she d been wanting aside from his love for the past year in order to bribe her to stay with him prat and he had the audacity to get upset what the fuck she stood up fine grabbing her wrap and purse she turned and left without a glance back severus suddenly got the feeling he did something horribly wrong back at the castle hermione stomped into her room slammed the door and threw the scroll tube at the wall she let out a frustrated shriek and then proceeded to do the twins proud by describing severus snape to the universe in general using the most insulting and vulgar terms possible aughhe that bastard flinging herself on the bed she punched her pillow in frustration what the hell happened to the suave and charming and admittedly odd severus snape that picked her up for a date earlier this evening while she wished he were more like himself she never wanted him to revert to type and be the bastard she knew he could be what was his issue did he really have such a problem with her showing happiness at being given the apprenticeship she dreamed of maybe he was hurt because she hadntbeen disappointed enough by not getting him to supervise her hmmm she would have to think on that a knock at the door startled her back to reality that better not be severus she muttered right now he was the last person she wanted to see her temper was still high and she didntwant to say anything to him that she might regret fortunately it was harry she was in his arms weeping before he had a chance to say anything harry having been through this on many occasions knew the better part of valor was to remain silent until she got the tears out of her system and was ready to talk gently guiding her back into her room he led her to the couch near the fireplace and pulled her into his lap what the bloody hell did snape do this time harry frowned from what he had seen of the man near breakdown in his rooms and all the planning he put into it he thought tonight would have been perfect what did the git say to her knowing he would get the answer once the tears stopped he waited patiently murmuring comforting words to her as he held his distraught best friend for the thousandth time in the past three years he cursed the ministry for forcing her to marry that moody bastard wh what wrong with me harry the soft question startled him what do you mean mione she sat up why is it that we canteven go on a simple date without somehow getting into a row that i have no idea how started what happened like with so many things with severus it started out extremely well the restaurant was beautiful he was charming and nice which was actually kind of strange and everything was going swimmingly until we got to the dessert part i guess he wanted you to have the cheesecake harry eyes twinkled mischievously as he ducked the glare from his best friend harry the lemon pie was it hermione swatted at him prompting a short tickle fight that ended with both of them on the floor breathing heavily the two gryffindors picked themselves up and settled back onto the couch still smiling harry couldnthelp but admire how beautiful she was even as she looked sternly at him it had nothing to do with dessert harry well dontkeep me in suspense then out with it he leaping excitedly to her feet hermione ran and fetched the scroll from dumbledore she thrust it at harry with a grin albus dumbledore offered me an apprenticeship harry face broke into a grin that wonderful mione now you can get your potions mastery he gave her a quick hug congratulations thanks severus gave me the scroll after we finished eating dinner so what the problem i dontknow one minute he seemed happy to be telling me that i have the chance to apprentice with albus dumbledore the next he was all cold and distant telling me that things had become disagreeable what what the bloody hell was that git thinking i dontknow what wrong with him harry i thought he d be happy that i would be able to get my mastery without having to apprentice to him he hated the idea of me being his student again maybe he was angry you were so thrilled about it after he went through all the trouble to get the headmaster to make this offer dontyou think that a bit hypocritical what makes you think he was behind this if headmaster dumbledore wanted me to be his apprentice he would have talked with me about it himself he certainly wouldnthave gone through severus snape when he was fully aware that i was not happy being with him harry was startled at that he knew that every bloody year since the first he been the one bribing me to stay here so i can save severus from himself well that explained a lot the seat on the wizengamot compensation for alexandria and the teaching position his bloody drinking binge the night of our second anniversary and now you think he bribing you with an apprenticeship what do you think harry he shook his head no mione it doesntmake sense i know albus wants you to stay with snape but why would he bribe you now he knows you re expecting even he cantask you to stay in an unpleasant situation with a baby she shrugged maybe he thinks things will get better like he always does mione i honestly think snape was speaking the truth when he asked you to give him another chance i saw his face he really seemed afraid you were going to leave him well he certainly hasntgiven me a reason to stay wait you said things were going well right hermione nodded so he freaked after you read the scroll yes i saw what was on the scroll and i told him how thrilled i was and how happy you were going to oh dear merlin what she sprang to her feet that it i have to go harry i have to talk to him but what hermione rushed to the door hoping it was not too late to talk with her husband she would hate for things to end because of a stupid misunderstanding i ll talk to you later harry i have to go harry watched as she ran out the door headed to the dungeons he shook his head those two really had issues hopefully the baby would help calm them both he on the other hand could use a good dose of fire whisky this roller coaster really needed to stop for all of them resolved to do some serious thinking harry headed back to his quarters hoping and honestly dreading that things worked out he wasntthe only one it was a long trip to the dungeons the longest perhaps of her life and hermione ran the entire way praying severus had not left she really didntwant to spend the evening hunting him down but she would if she had to they needed to talk the wards on severus rooms had fortunately not been changed he was either too angry to think of it or he wanted to give her the chance to apologize she thought good maybe it wasnttoo late quickly waving her wand she bypassed the wards and burst into he husband rooms he was sitting in front of the fire with a bottle in his hand what the bloody hell are you doing here potter not available this was not the most auspicious start to the conversation hopefully it would not end as badly as the last we need to talk severus i dontsee what the bloody fuck we need to talk about hermione you made yourself perfectly clear at dinner where your priorities lie severus she circled around his chair to face him that not true and you know it it always been potter hasntit potter this potter that potter potter potter severus shut the hell up and listen he blinked at her surprised it not po harry severus now would you listen to me for a moment reluctantly he nodded this should be interesting he thought bleakly when you told me about albus offering me an apprenticeship i was very happy not because it wouldntbe with you but because i ve been dreaming about getting my potions mastery for three years now i need it for alchemy you know that but you shush severus and listen i said harry would be thrilled about it because he my best friend not because i wanted to share it with him more than i wanted to share it with you she touched his arm severus you were already there i didntneed to tell you about it you already knew but i severus harry is my best friend he has been since our first year at hogwarts you cantexpect me to tell him to bugger off just because my husband has a bit of an issue with jealousy i love you but i will not give up my friends for you i harry and i are very close yes but it is more like a brotherly affection than he in love with you hermione he interrupted how can i not be jealous when my wife best friend is the man that been in love with her since before we were married brotherly affection my arse i see how the two of you are together it is only your marriage to me that keeps the two of you apart how can you ask me to be accepting of that her eyes widened in shock i it not like that severus not anymore then what is it like hermione how do you feel about him i i sorry severus i canttell you that i dontknow harry and i never had the chance to find out if there was anything beyond friendship between us and you expect me to be satisfied with that severus i i need you to be okay with my friendship with harry it important to me as much as your marriage silence reigned for a few moments and then yes she reached out and took his hand before he could move away severus you mean more to me than i ever imagined possible but harry been in my life since i was a child he my best friend no he more than a friend he like family please understand that i need him as much as i need you you are my husband and i love you i suddenly it sank in what she was saying what she had said she loved him he knew it yes from his visions of the past but it was only now that she finally told him he never realized how much it would mean to him to hear those words before she could react he grabbed her arm and pulled her to him i love you too my dearest the kiss he gave her was soft and gentle the lightest touch of his lips upon hers he longed to kiss her with all the passion he felt within him but was afraid of driving her away he dared not release the raging emotions within him just yet not until they were both comfortable with each other and their feelings he pulled back gazing into her beautiful chocolate eyes for the first time since they were married he released the barriers on his mind and let her see the love he felt for her shining in the obsidian depths of his the beatific smile she gave him was well worth the feeling of vulnerability i sorry severus i should have thought about how you would feel before i said something she gently touched a finger to his lips forgive me he crushed her to him only if you forgive me hermione i should have tried to understand the two sat intertwined for several minutes enjoying the sensation of being in the arms of the one they loved it was a dream come true for both of them and neither wanted it to end any time soon it was hermione however that broke the silence severus yes love i she sat back but not before taking his hand in hers er how do i say this the dark haired professor frowned what do you mean was she about to say that despite everything she was still leaving bugger i severus you remember what i said when i agreed to this three month trial between us of course then you remember what i said about being yourself yes then you think maybe we can try our date again only with you as yourself this time he smirked how do you know that was not me as myself because i know you severus i know you can be romantic that not the issue there are times during the past three years you have proven that quite vividly but even then you ve always had a sarcastic edge to your personality that i find incredibly uh she blushed incredibly what it was all he could do not to smirk incredibly oh bugger how do i say this er he gently cupped her face perhaps you should simply spit it out my dear if anything she turned redder uh he leaned forward to whisper in her ear you find my sarcasm incredibly hermione shivered as his hot breath puffed against her ear i annoying perhaps he was going to drive her insane if he didntstop breathing in her ear well uh all thought was driven out of her head as his lips touched her neck you were saying oh uh another delicate kiss and she was mindless again perhaps you might give me a hint kiss or perhaps a clue nibble maybe something in the form of an allusion suddenly she was in his arms her lips glued to his when she tore herself away they were both panting sexy you teasing bastard i find your sarcasm sexy okay his smirk made her realize it wasntjust his sarcastic mannerisms that she found enthralling then i will have to make sure i bring the appropriate arsenal of commentary with us the next time we go out the smile on her face lit up the room yes there was going to be a next time i thank you severus he kissed her no my dear thank you you have given this old and evil bastard another chance at happiness i can only hope i prove worthy of your kindness knowing she was on the verge of doing something she was not prepared for hermione gently removed herself from her husband embrace i should go back to my room now he nodded understanding he too was feeling the need to drag her into the bedroom long before he thought she was ready for it goodnight love the kiss she gave him curled his toes goodnight severus ever the gentleman he walked her back to her rooms and gently kissed her goodnight before taking himself back to the dungeons on the way back to his rooms it suddenly occurred to him that there was no need for them to go back to the dragon treasure hermione would probably like something different something very romantic and personal he had just the thing
