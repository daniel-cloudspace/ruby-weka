 forever year six part three subtitled la vie d autre lily shivered beneath her cloak and clung to it for added warmth you okay james asked smiling at her yeah it just kind of cold down here she said as she returned his smile as they continued towards hogsmeade they walked in silence most of the way neither daring to break it this new found shyness made both of them rather uncomfortable but just as lily was about to say something they reached hogsmeade the village was as wonderful as she had remembered and even though she had lived in the wizarding world for six years she never tired of seeing it in action all around her hags witches wizards warlocks and many many more bustled about she grinned in excitement at james who whole heartedly returned it so where do you want to go he asked and looked at her expectantly she shrugged i guess it doesntreally matter what time do we have to meet sirius and anna he glanced at his watch one he said so we have about an hour where are we meeting them she asked as she tried to figure out where in the village they could go without being late james grinned wickedly the shrieking shack he said her eyes grew wide why she asked he shrugged you ll see he said so where to he asked and brushed a piece of jet black hair out of his eyes three broomsticks she suggested after a moment she shifted her weight uncomfortably the initial excitement of hogsmeade had worn off and the feeling was back again noticing the look on her face james frowned are you okay he asked yeah she said but she didntlook okay are you sure he asked raising an eyebrow we can go back if you dontwant to be here he said and gestured to the building they had come from she nodded no no it not that it just it really stupid she said shaking her head i dontknow do you ever get a feeling that that something bad is going to happen she asked her eyebrows knitted in thought yeah he admitted after a moment remembering when his parents had died in his second year well i ve got one of those i just can t i just cantshake it she frowned do want to go back james asked again concerned he ran a hand through his already messy hair this was not going as he had planned she pursed her lips and shook her head no it ll be fine she said i just being silly she said and tried to smile brightly james couldnthelp but note that her smile didntreach her eyes lily giggled and took another gulp of her butterbeer i can not believe you bought that james she said rolling her eyes sirius is going to kill you james grinned charmingly and his eyes flashed with anticipation yeah but it ll be worth it he chuckled as he held sirius surprise it was a matching thong and bra set rather erm racy ones at that anna birthday was coming up and sirius had wanted james and lily to go ahead to hogsmeade to get her gift for him he had meant for them to get her a book that she had been wanting which they did as well james pulled out the birthday card and with a great flourish wrote to my darling anna maybe you model them later sirius lily burst out laughing her face had grown rather warm this is so bad she said shaking her head he going to murder you in your sleep and then anna will kill me too she said finding that idea a little bit less entertaining yeah but wontbe worth it when anna slaps him in front of everybody he asked mischievously besides its all in good fun he said he put the card into the bag and with a whisper and a tap of his wand the present was in a box and wrapped with wrapping paper that had wizard pictures of anna and sirius together all over it lily was just about to respond when the door to the three broomsticks shot open she shivered and the foreboding feeling that she had kept at bay for so long returned full blast james hadntwe better go meet them she asked as she glanced nervously at the men who had just walked into the pub james so intent on his prank didntpick up on anything and glanced at his watch oh you re right he cried and jumped up as he gathered his bags in an hour they had done a lot of damage lily gathered her things quickly and made a beeline for the door she wanted out of there and she wanted out right then james had to jog to catch up with her hey he said as he finally reached her what the hurry we wont be that late and even if we were i doubt they would mind he waggled his eyebrows suggestively she blushed and gave a small chuckle yeah i know i just hate being late she said as she lied through her teeth she breathed a sigh of relief as up ahead the shrieking shack came into view she never thought she d rather be in the shrieking shack than the three broomsticks so she said as james muttered a few words and the boards flew off the door any particular reason why we re meeting our friends in a haunted building she asked and tried to act unafraid she was bad at it he smiled reassuringly at her you know it not haunted lil he said and started into the dark house lumos he whispered and a light appeared at the end of his wand lily rolled her eyes yeah she said i know and followed him into the house above them she heard voices and despite what she knew of the shrieking shack she trembled they climbed the stairs james first followed by lily james pushed open the door to find anna and sirius going at it ahem james said as he cleared his throat sirius detached himself from anna hello jamsie lily you re here early he said cheerfully did you have fun anna asked as she watched her friend for signs of how the date had gone lily did not look good her already pale face was sheet white and she was shaking anna smile slowly fell are you okay lily she asked slightly horrified at the look of terror on her face james turned around and his eyes grew wide lily what wrong he asked and put his arms around her just as her legs were about to give way lily was shaking violently and her eyes had grown wide silent tears were pouring down her face what the matter james asked starting to get scared himself she said nothing but burrowed in his arms as though to protect her james sirius and anna exchanged worried glances make it stop she whispered into james chest he put his arms around her and held her make it stop she started sobbing make what stop baby tell me what wrong james said urgently he had never been so afraid in his entire life the screaming she whispered so much screaming james eyes grew wide at this what screaming lils he asked soothingly but inside he was afraid for her sweetie there no screaming he said but just as he said it screaming filled the room anna and sirius ran to the window jesus christ sirius cried and reached for his wand oh my god anna gasped and gave a half shriek what james asked as lily grew worse what is it he yelled scared and unsure what to do lily was muttering now about pain james you d better take a look at this sirius said unable to tear his eyes from the scene anna on the other hand couldntbring herself to look she ran to lily and took her from james so he could see i ve got her she said james glanced at her reluctant to leave what the hell sirius cried in anger and james flew to the window james eyes grew wide at what he saw in the street below seven men in long capes with hoods covering their heads were marching in a row wands drawn behind them lay a street full of murdered wizards and witches the one of the men pointed his wand up and a death mark was formed while the other six continued to kill everyone they saw james eyes grew hard this was his chance he chance to get revenge to make things right he glanced and lily sobbing form and drew his wand where are you going anna cried as jamie started towards the door i going to do something i should have done a long time ago james said and flung open the door sirius stop him anna cried as she watched in horror within seconds sirius had turned run and tackled james what the fuck do you think you re doing james sirius roared as he pinned the struggling james sirius was glad that he had grown over the summer and was now bigger than his friend i going to take care of business james said and almost wiggled out of sirius grasp sirius laughed bitterly and tightened his grip on james shoulders oh i see yes you getting killed will definitely help a lot of things james glared at him resentfully but stopped struggling i wasntgoing to get killed he muttered oh right james sure sirius said rolling his eyes he loosened his grip on his friend though you were going to go out and face seven fully armed death eaters who had just taken out a whole street of qualified witches and wizards all by yourself and come out alive well when you put it that way james said a frown on his face suddenly sirius jumped off of james and ran to the window it stopped he said softly as he watched the sea of dead bodies james his foolish crusade forgotten for a moment went to the window oh my god he gasped and shook his head that sirius said pointing to the ground below was almost you james glanced down at the nameless faceless many and shivered it wasnta fate he had been dying to receive behind them lily gave a whimper and both boys turned to see anna stoking lily hair and murmuring soothingly lily had calmed down a great deal occasionally she hiccupped but for the most part she was silent her body had stopped its shuddering and she lay motionless in anna lap how is she james asked anna looked up her eyes shone from unshed tears and her lip was almost bleeding from being bitten so hard better she said james came over and took lily in his arms he held her limp form she had passed out we have to get her back he said and glanced nervously let go the usual way prongs sirius said glancing at his friend meaningfully and jerking his head in the direction of the secret passage way to the whomping willow sirius as he helped a now crying anna out seemed the picture of strength but then nobody saw how badly his hands were shaking earlier that day i bored peter announced and ate yet another blood pop dontyou have homework or something roslyn snapped irritably it was the tenth time he had said it in five minutes and she was trying to concentrate on a game of wizards chess a game she was usually very good at but today was getting destroyed check remus announced as his queen smashed her knight damn she muttered and tried to find away out after all it wasntcheck mate yet i dontwant to do homework peter said scowling so go flying remus said i lent my broom out go to the kitchens i not hungry take a nap i not tired read a book there isntanything good to read borrow one of mine i dontlike yours take a walk i dontwant to what do you want to do peter roslyn cried in frustration as just then another knight was taken he shrugged not at all upset at her outburst i dunno he said check remus grinned ugh i give up roslyn cried and threw up her hands just as her king threw down his crown here peter play chess she said peter smiled sweetly okay he said and moved to take her spot roslyn shook her head sadly she had just been manipulated by peter pettigrew they decided to go straight to the headmaster office as it was sunday afternoon the halls were empty and james couldnthave been more grateful he didntthink he could explain an unconscious lily and a sobbing anna in passing to a teacher actually james was so shocked himself he really felt like doing nothing else but climbing under a bed and never coming out again he didntwant to be strong all he wanted was to forget everything he had seen sirius as the reality had sunk it was looking more and more terrified his face was a rather unnatural shade of white all color had been drained from his face they walked as fast as they could considering that james was carrying lily and sirius was dragging anna cotton candy james said and the door flew open sirius looked at him questioningly i was here yesterday for a prefect thing he explained james shifted lily who was becoming rather heavy and walked into the room professors avery mcgonagall and binns were all gathered there for a staff meeting and they looked up in surprise as they walked into the room potter black fisher evans mcgonagall said with a gasp what is the meaning of this professor james said urgently to dumbledore we must speak with you there been an attack in hogsmeade at this anna sobs became heart wrenching the affect of this one sentence was instantaneous what potter my god how do you know they all spoke at once and james already distraught scared and tired was near tears at all the yelling his tired arms couldnthold lily any longer and he struggled so as not to drop her sirius sat anna down in the nearest chair and took lily from his arms everyone calm down dumbledore said meaningfully his face seemed calm but there was something else in dumbledore eye besides its resident twinkle it was cold and dark and it made james want to cower he turned to james and his manner became softer go on james he said gently lily and i were in hogsmeade there were several raised eyebrows at this but everybody kept their silence and we stopped in the shrieking shack to meet up with sirius and anna but as soon as we got inside lily started getting really weird she got really pale and was shaking all over she kept talking about screaming and pain except there werentany the place was silent he spoke so quickly that everyone had to strain to understand him he looked around for some sign to continue dumbledore nodded at him encouragingly as soon as we told her that there wasntany screaming we heard some from the street we looked out the window and we saw we saw he swallowed painfully and the memory yes potter mcgonagall said kindly we saw death eaters he burst out they murdered everyone they saw in the street and then apparated away his voice was thick with emotion and it took all his strength to keep from bursting into tears by then lily had passed out and so we had to get back the second his mouth shut dumbledore flew into action minerva send an owl to the ministry immediately mcgonagall nodded and left the room almost before he finished speaking charles he said to avery get madame pomfrey wouldntit be better to take them to poppy professor avery asked meekly as he glanced at a hysterical anna and an unconscious lily no dumbledore said simply avery glanced at him one last time before walking briskly from the room please james sirius sit down dumbledore said and motioned to the chairs in front of him he flicked his wand and lily flew from sirius arms and levitated in the air next to him i suppose we could have done that to begin with james said dully as sirius sat down heavily in between anna and james yeah i guess so sirius said with even less feeling than james he began to rub anna back as intense as it had all been suddenly as everything began to get taken care of it was as though the life had been sucked out of them suddenly and owl flew in and dumbledore nimbly jumped up and grabbed it from the birds talons he sat down and read through the paper he pursed his lips it seems he said as he folded the parchment up that the ministry is aware already of what has happened this afternoon but doesntwish to alarm anybody in other words we arentto speak of it to anybody dumbledore sighed heavily professor james asked after madame pomfrey comes and revives lily and calms down anna i d like to talk to you about what happened james nodded listlessly he was so tired and so confused that he could hardly think let alone form cognitive answers ah said dumbledore here she is now and sure enough the door to his study flew open and there stood madame pomfrey as formidable as ever what have you gone and done now black potter she said and walked vigorously to the girls tsk tsk tsk she clucked disapprovingly a quidditch accident i suppose she said shaking her head darkly no ma am sirius said well than i sure it was something equally dangerous she said and muttered something slowly very slowly lily was lowered to the ground madam pomfrey opened her mouth a little bit and poured a potion down her throat moments later lily eyes fluttered open before lily could say anything madame pomfrey moved onto anna oh and i suppose you werentdoing anything dangerous either madame pomfrey asked but before anna could wail her answer madame pomfrey handed her a vile of some rather evil looking potion anna hand was shaking so violently that the liquid almost didntmake it to her mouth but with sirius help she was able to swallow the fluid he steadied her hand as soon as the potion touched her lips she gave a great shudder and fell into sirius arms hey he cried you were supposed to calm her down not knock her out madame pomfrey put her hands on her hips did you see the state she was in black she said there isntenough calming potion in britain she shook her head again and started towards the door thank you poppy dumbledore said as she left muttering under her breath about foolish kids by this time lily was fully awake and was sitting up where where am i she asked her hand to her head in confusion dumbledore office james said and helped her up and into the chair next to him how do you feel okay she said and stared about her taking it all in she stared at anna what happened she asked incredulously madame pomfrey knocked her out sirius said pouting oh lily said she paused for a moment why are we here she asked ms fisher should come to any moment sirius and i ll explain everything in a moment lily dumbledore said and watched anna expectantly sure enough within seconds anna eyes flew open welcome back dumbledore said smiling anna nodded dumbledore smile slowly faded i know it difficult but i think you four deserve some kind of explanation about what happened today what there to explain james asked with a sigh seven death eaters killed a street of wizards and witches it pretty self explanatory he said dumbledore tightened his lips the ministry doesntwant us telling the students this but i suspect that it will all come out soon enough sirius looked up in interest professor he asked you re all aware of lord voldemort and his activities i suppose they all nodded well i afraid that most of it you dontknow nearly all of the incidents involving him never reach the daily prophet he been slowly gaining power for years now the press likes to isolate the incidents they do get a hold of if the public knew how bad it really was well lets just say that the minister doesntfeel that now is the time to enlighten everybody i was planning on informing you of the truth on graduation but this does change things a bit he tugged on his beard in thought the truth is that we dontknow how to stop to stop him our aurors have been disappearing all over europe do you understand he asked the four teenagers already so forgone with exhaustion confusion and shock heard every word he said yet absorbed none of it even so they all nodded what happened today was undeniably a tragedy however everything about voldemort will come out in due course what happened today for the sake of our aurors who need to be able to work without the press being all over it needs to be a secret it an awful awful thing to live with i know the minister wants me to simply erase your memories as they are going to do to the survivors in hogsmeade but i believe you deserve no need to understand as much as you ever will in the coming months fear will grow the world will change and for everybody in this school so will how they look at the world it will be different for you four your perspective has already drastically changed i wish i could just ask you to learn from today and move on but after what you witnessed today i wouldntdare i will ask you however to keep these events between the four of you he paused and looked every student in the eye in turn do you have any questions lily head throbbed with a million questions all fighting to be asked she put her hand to her pounding head she couldntdeal with this not anymore all she wanted was to be out of there no she said anna and james shook their heads me either sirius said quietly he had so many issues with this whole thing that he couldnteven begin to start dumbledore held each of there gazes a moment before speaking again alright then he said sighing you re dismissed you re all excused from classes for the week if you dontfeel like staying in the dormitories you may stay in the infirmary or anywhere else you find that is suitable they got up to leave lily i d like to have a word with you lily sat back down she glanced back at james who looked at her questioningly you may wait for her outside james dumbledore said the twinkle back in his eye he nodded and followed anna and sirius out of the office dumbledore turned his attention to lily so i understand that you had la vie d autre today lily stared at him blankly la vie d autre she asked dumbledore side stepped her question completely today lily before you passed out what happened lily looked at him uncertainly for a moment she took a deep breath and willed herself with all her might to relive what had happened she shivered involuntarily and took another breath i followed james into the shrieking shack she started as she remembered her face drained of any color she had gained since she woke up her hands became clammy and her breath labored she stared unseeingly ahead of her lily eyes blinked rapidly to stop her eyes from overflowing with unshed tears we had barely made it up the stairs when when all the screaming started she said softly so much screaming she whispered shaking her head they were crying crying for me to help them she put head in her hands but i couldn t she breathed goosebumps covered her arms at the memory then all of the sudden i was in so much pain it came and went in waves it was awful at first then it would fade away and then start again just as awful then all of the sudden the pain was gone she stopped and looked up at dumbledore that all i remember professor dumbledore nodded i see he said lily i think the best thing for you is to get some rest i believe james sirius and anna are waiting for you outside lily nodded she was about to ask again about la vie d autre but for the first time in her life lily was happier not knowing she glanced back one last time at the professor before stepping out of his office and into the school forever year six part four subtitled the calm after the storm a n hey everybody i know it been ages since i posted regularly but i back and i promise to finish out the series i do have two questions and they may seem entirely silly or at least one of them should but bear with me if you could tell me a country you d like to see them in it would really help me a lot it can be any country but japan brazil or anywhere in the uk also let me know if you want me to continue this after hogwarts i had planned on it but if you guys dontwant me to i won t so that it on with the show lily stepped out of the headmaster office and onto the cold flagstone she took a deep breath and looked around her james offered a weak smile which she tried to return and anna and sirius just stood staring at nothing in particular so lily said after a moment should we go back to the tower she ran her hands roughly through her hair james and sirius exchanged looks i guess said sirius with a shrug i dontreally want to anna said softly the idea of facing all those people roslyn remus and peter in particular and to have to lie to them to not be able to tell what had really happened what was really wrong killed her she didntthink she could take anymore to pain today for the moment she was numb she wanted to keep it that way me either lily agreed as she shuffled her feet where should we go then james asked tiredly i dontcare said anna me either sirius said and shifted uncomfortably emotional intensity like what they had gone through this afternoon really wasnthis specialty why dontwe just go to the red room james asked eager to get out of the hallway where he felt so vulnerable for the first time in his time at hogwarts he didntfeel safe behind the thick stone walls yeah okay sirius said sounds good lily said anna just shrugged noncommittally they walked with about as much enthusiasm as they felt lily could smell the musty air of this part of the castle which was rarely used she could hear her friends walking both behind her and in front of her she could see the paintings on the wall and the coat of armor at the next bend as she bit through the skin of her lip she could taste the saltiness of her blood but no matter how hard she tried she couldntfeel anything she thought of james and felt nothing she thought swiftly of this afternoon and felt nothing she thought of her parents her friends her future her past and still nothing had she been capable of it this sudden lack of emotion would have scared her half to death but the more she thought about it the more she was grateful that her feelings had suddenly deserted her if she couldntfeel she couldnt hurt she hadntdwelt on this long though when they came to the red room with closed eyes and arms outstretched they stepped through the stone wall separating the hallway and the red room one at a time the red room besides as an occasional meeting place served no real purpose and was in fact not just one room but two james had found it in their second year when he had leaned against the wall to tie his shoe and tumbled through into the red room it had been given its name for the sole reason that it was entirely red or some variety of the color since it christening at lily 12th birthday party it had been improved upon immensely bunk beds had been added in red of course to the second room as had a pantry to hold any food they got their hands on there were also huge stashes of any needed prank material imaginable most of the changes had been made during the years that late night potion brewing and research were needed for the animagus transformations the first room had a sort of eating area with a table chairs and a pantry there was also a fireplace with a plush couch and too armchairs in front of it as well book cases filled to the rim with books in the second room were three bunk beds one single bed and a bathroom as the boys checked the pantry for food the girls set about cleaning things up anna made the beds and lily lit the fire they went through the motions efficiently but silently there not very much food james said after a moment nobody not even sirius cared james shut the pantry door and sat down heavily in the arm chair nearest the fire for the first time all day he put his head in his hands and allowed himself to think things through sirius was about to join him as there was another chair directly opposite his but thought better of it he instead strode across the room to a large scarlet chest and pulled open the lid he looked inside and managed a grin hey at least there supplies he said and held up a dungbomb for proof great maybe we can turn you know who yellow anna snapped with a scowl and curled up on the couch sirius smile faded and he slowly put the dungbomb into the chest and shut it he sighed bit his lip and pushed a strand of his dark brown hair out of his eyes with a glance at his shaking girlfriend he walked to the couch not knowing what to say he put his arms around her and just held her meanwhile lily unlike her friends was not about to approach the situation with thought denial or sarcasm in fact she wasnt going to approach it at all she bustled about the kitchen like area of the red room preparing dinner she set the table poured the drinks and flicked her wand expertly as she prepared lasagna a salad and even cheesecake what she didnthave in the room she summoned humming all the while dinner ready she said crisply and reviewed her work with satisfaction lily lips twisted into a very small smile after all her motto was when in doubt keep busy everyone else looked up with a cross between amazement and confusion you made dinner lily james asked incredulously as he eyed the steaming plates she nodded with pride anna opened her mouth to say something but decided against it well come on lily said are you going to eat or what sirius raised his eyebrows at his cousin but as he was never one to turn down food when offered to him he sat down and dug in james and anna exchanged looks but joined at the table roslyn glanced at her watch and frowned where are they she asked remus shrugged and looked up from his book mildly interested what time is it he asked nearly eight she said shaking her head and pursing her lips we have classes tomorrow and i know for a fact that anna hasntdone any of her homework yet remus raised his eyebrows in surprise eight he asked with a small laugh and a small he shook his head will they ever learn well i hope they learn soon if avery catches them sneaking back they will be in detention until they graduate roslyn said as she tossed her long black hair you say it like it a bad thing ros remus said playfully a grin playing on her lips roslyn smiled despite herself and rolled her eyes you re bad news lupin she said remus nodded so they keep telling me he said his grin growing wider hey speaking of missing where peter he asked noticing for the first time that his friend was absent i dontknow she said as she looked around the room and noticed too that he wasntin the common room he was at dinner hmm remus said and dismissed it oh and dontworry about lily james anna and sirius remus continued a smirk replacing his grin they probably just got ahem carried away roslyn opened her mouth with a whole hearted agreement when she felt a light tapping on her shoulder roslyn a timid first year asked roslyn smiled warmly and nodded yes she asked the first year scuffed his feet and spoke softly without looking her in the eye professor dumbledore told me to tell you he recited that he started counting the names off of his fingers at this point james anna lily and and sirius roslyn supplied yeah sirius went to he paused as he strained to remember what she had said oh to visit mrs black who is sick he finished and looked up hopefully to see if the message meant something to her she furrowed her eyebrows but nodded the first year glad to be released from his chore bounded off to do other things that is so weird she said with a shake of her head remus nodded in agreement i wonder why anna went roslyn shrugged i dunno she said i guess she was there when they found out and wanted to go along i hope everything okay she added after dinner lily cleaned up and then they just gathered in front of the fire sirius and anna took the couch and lily and james took the arms chairs anna probably the most visibly shaken of the four seemed in control all through dinner but then madame pomfrey potion began to wear off and james and lily looked on helplessly as she sobbed in sirius arms after a minute or two he silently gathered her in his arms and carried her to the next room with a click the door was shut and lily and james were left alone they sat in silence for a moment but after a minute the quiet without sirius lame attempts at jokes or even anna cries was unnerving i sorry thank you james and lily burst out at the same time they both laughed you go first james said graciously lily smiled sweetly and tucked a piece of auburn hair behind her ear i just wanted to say thank you james for today and being so great and everything he shrugged i was glad to do it he said simply she smiled so what were you going to say i just wanted to say that i sorry lily looked at him blankly for what she asked he looked at her in total and complete remorse lily i feel awful about this i should never have asked you to go to hogsmeade it all my fault he said heavily that ridiculous james this is no more your fault than mine she then smiled shyly besides she said a blush creeping into her cheeks i glad you asked me she said looking him in the eye really he asked dropping the argument for the moment she nodded and he grinned he bit his lip took a deep breath and squared his shoulders alright lily i mean i know this is awful timing probably the worst timing i ve ever had but if i dontask you this i ll explode he took another deep breath and lily nodded encouragingly despite his rather lame speech what i mean to say is do you want to give it another shot he asked his gorgeous blue eyes searching her green ones lily thought quickly before a smile grew slowly on her face okay she said maybe the day wasnt completely from hell she thought as they smiled at each other over the next couple of days anna finally calmed down she didntcry in the day any more and her crying at night was less every night she and sirius despite being slightly subdued went about things in the red room as though nothing had happened james wasntfooled by his antics he knew what happened that afternoon haunted sirius as much as it did him sirius hadn t in the site of anybody shed a tear but late at night james who slept in the bed underneath his could hear him tossing and turning relentlessly james as it was his way had thought out everything that had happened from start to finish every time he saw in his mind eye lily sobbing on the ground those people in the street or the look of terror on sirius face his knuckles grew white as he clenched his wand as for lily she kept extraordinarily busy during the day but at night no amount of scrubbing could kept the night mares away the truth was no matter how scared or shaken her friends were she beat them tenfold she had experienced those murders first hand she felt every curse every wound ever death as though it were her own and you dontjust shake off your death she didntknow what had come over her that day she wasnteven sure she wanted to know they would return to the rest of the school on sunday afternoon and then go to classes lily couldntwait to get back the more people the more distractions then again she was enjoying the quality time with james thursday noon red room i win anna cried triumphantly and swept her earnings off the table and into her arms i win i win i win she sang and danced about the red room happily you re such a sore winner sirius said with a pout and you are such a sore loser she said and grinned at him infuriatingly oh yeah he asked his eyebrows up yeah she said meeting his challenge her arms crossed defiantly over her chest okay then he said a smile playing on his lips and before anna even knew what was happening sirius had pounced on her and was tickling her madly her giggling reached hysterical heights and james and lily looked on with amusement kids lily said shaking her head when will they learn james shrugged a wicked grin forming on his lips i dont know he said and took a leaf out of sirius book and tackled her thursday 6 35 pm gryffindor common room did you see his face roslyn called breathlessly as she remus and peter burst into the common room yeah it was classic remus said and collapsed into the nearest armchair as he burst out laughing priceless peter added with a giggle and sat down indian style opposite of remus i think that snape might finally do something about his hair roslyn said as she remembered with pride their newly pulled prank they had spelled a sign over snape head that alternately flashed some very kind phrases i an ugly git i dontbelieve in personal hygiene or roslyn personal favorite kick me if i smell bad to name a few peter glanced at his watch and jumped up i d better go he said and started towards the portrait where roslyn called after him detention he said and was gone remus turned to roslyn shrugged he the what fifth friend we ve lost this week roslyn grinned what can i say she said we have mad skill remus rolled his i think i d rather be good at potions he said as he remembered his potion test the following morning you could always ask snape for help she said with a smirk remus raised his eyebrows and then give him a swift kick in the ass too well only if that flashes she said her blue eyes shining with excitement of yet another chance to embarrass snape i can wait remus assured her and gathered his books that my boy roslyn said go get em tiger remus turned around just as he had reached the portrait and grinned charmingly am i a marauder or what he asked and was gone roslyn shook her head with pride and started on her charms homework sunday 7 15 pm gryffindor common room hey roslyn cried and enveloped anna and then lily in a hug welcome back you guys she steered them to the couch oh my god she gushed you missed so much lily smiled weakly at her friend and sat down on james lap he put his arms protectively around her and she snuggled into his chest apparently though not as much as we did remus said with a smirk as he eyed james and lily james grinned what can i say stuff happens it about bloody time too sirius added much to everyone pleasure here here remus said and put his butterbeer to his lips i ll drink to that roslyn added so are you official now peter asked curiously lily nodded though she blushed slightly remus smiled happy for his friend good he said and sat back content
