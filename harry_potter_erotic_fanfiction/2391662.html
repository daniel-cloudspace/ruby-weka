 disclaimer aint mine come on now you should know that by now getterdone ch 10 consequences of falling i apparated into our backyard after i saw harry off at king cross it was night in america i was exhausted physically and mentally that question he had asked hagrid had hit me like a brick wall i now knew exactly what it would be like to walk into a barrier that didntled you to the hogwarts express i opened the sliding doors after examining my precious flowers in the moonlight having found a great love for gardening hey lily you home love i cried closing the door behind me as i walked into our kitchen jaime that you i heard her voice ask sounded like she was upstairs well no not jaime james i said never having liked that nickname i prefer prongs and or james jaime never really clicked with me right sorry she giggled i upstairs sweetie i walked up the stairs using the staircase that led there from the kitchen eager to see her i took the steps in two s i walked into the bedroom to see her in her pajamas sitting indian style on the bed with a beautiful song playing in the background candles were lit everywhere and they were the only source of light in our room i frowned as i stood in the doorway admiring my wife beauty in the candlelight she beamed at me hello hello i smiled back taking off my hat what have you been up to lily shrugged with a secretive smirk on her face oh nothing working waiting i nodded with a cynical look at her what she asked indignantly she failed to hide her smile from her tone i raised my eyebrows and then lowered them with a smile knowing her knowing me that look meant tell me what going on or i ll tickle it out of you how did it go she asked me it went i ll tell you when you tell me what you re up to i smiled two can play that game james she said enticingly they can i asked slowly walking towards her taking off my coat and throwing it on the chair mmh she answered beaming at me i chuckled you re becoming as fastidious as i love i said close enough now to bend down and kiss her right she smiled as she pulled me back with her on the bed so i was on top of her she put her arms around my neck and drew me down i wanna die in your arms james her breath tickled the inside of my ear as i snaked my hands behind her waist but this confession from her surprised me though i had heard her say it quite a lot something about the way she said the authenticity in her voice caught my attention and the way her arms convulsed around me like she would never let me go what going on with you i asked kissing the inside of her ear settling down on top of her so she was comfortable and not smashed nothing she whispered her fingers running through my hair at my nape i just want you to hold me squeeze me and never let go ok i said slowly increasing my grip on her i want you to hold me so close so tight that i can just melt into your body and live there for the longest time she whispered have you ever had the murderously obsessive feeling of wanting climb into someone skin in my case yours and live there being a man i inclined to deny such things i said every single time i see you i want to climb inside your skin and never let go she whispered just so i can be close to you protected by you something bothering you i whispered and flipped us over so that she was on top she settled down now her head on my chest arms around my waist now as i secured her there squeezing her as hard as i could to comply with her request she was hiding something from me something was wrong because she was never this vulnerable sure she always asked me to squeeze her to me but she sounded desperate i ll tell you when i ready k she asked placing a kiss on my heart right i sighed and began massaging her scalp i dontknow how long we were there but she felt good i must admit i think maybe three hours passed with me staring up at the ceiling of the room and lily lying motionless on me when i felt a tear drop on to my thin shirt it didnttake me too long to figure out lily was crying why i didntexactly know if i asked she wouldnttell me if i comforted her with words she wouldntrespond perhaps cry harder what else was there for me to do except let her cry silently on my shoulder and pretend i donthear her so i held her close kissed her head and rolled us so we were on our sides facing each other she fell asleep just as light was protruding through the darkness tears dribbling down her cheeks i had to get going to hogwarts with the helpless feeling baby i gotta get going to school wanna come along i asked brushing a finger down her cheek to wake her up from fitful sleep she shook her head i have work she whispered burying her head in my chest as though light was offending her alright i guess we can use a pensieve i smiled you gotta let go of me now i smiled slowly unwrapping her arms from around my waist harry had apparently inherited the death grip from his mother i ll be back before you know it i kissed her head as she curled up with my pillow ok she yawned her eyes still closed her cheeks stained i love you lily more then you will ever now i assured her kissing the inside of her ear and got off of our bed i grabbed my invisibility cloak on my way out after changing into another pair of jeans and t shirt i paused to look at lily for one last time she was slipping away from me just like i had expected her to those first few days bye james give my love to hogwarts she said in her sleep i chuckled and closed the door behind me throwing the cloak on i dissaparated to hogsmead i made my way up the familiar driveway to the beaming castle in front of me i passed hagrid hut smiling when i spotted the beech tree the marauder had deemed their own which was also the spot lily evens agreed to go out with me after that famous night you now know about so many memories i was about to scream with them buzzing in my ear the whomping willow i chuckled silently when i remembered the marauder endless exploits i suddenly had the urge to transform into a stag again and run the woods for a sentimental reason i knew not of but i decided to do it after the sorting i went up to the castle and on dumbledore orders in an earlier conversation made my way up to his office as i stood in front of the gargoyle that i knew for a fact led to dumbledore lavish office i remembered having forgotten to ask the password it wasnthard to figure out what it was just the details were missing i began naming names of different candies lemon drops liquorish wands berty bott every flavored beans until i finally surprised myself having said snickers with a growing hopelessness the gargoyle came to life and jumped to the side to reveal the famous revolving steps to his office snickers really i asked expecting it to answer me as i walked up the steps i reached the door when i was thinking about how an old man could like snickers wouldntthey stick to his frail teeth but then again we re talking about albus dumbledore i arrived at the door and didnttake the cloak off as i knocked on it the door opened and dumbledore himself stood there with a smile james he asked staring right at me yeah i muttered come in he smiled and let me enter to signify that i was inside i let my head show and i smiled at him wondering how people would react if they saw a dead man head floating in dumbledore office then again dumbledore has a way of attracting the attention of strange things so it wouldntlook too suspicious everyone has just arrived he smiled they are in fact about to be escorted into the great hall he said looking at his watch as i noticed not one of the former headmaster portrait was occupied he probably ordered them to scram cool i nodded smiling as i once more wanted to see the aw struck expression as harry laid those eyes on the castle where do i go where do i stand i asked i want you to stay close to harry as i believe that if i asked you to stay behind my chair you would go to him anyway he smiled his eyes twinkled as he looked at me over his half moon spectacles as a man doomed with the potter man curse of failing vision i couldntimagine myself being able to see through those glasses i chuckled nothing passed the old kook not even invisibility cloaks i followed dumbledore silently down to the great hall standing right behind him when he sat down the four large tables will filled with eager young students excited about being back at school for a change i smiled when i remembered my own first day how fun and excitingly hilarious it had been when i discovered that i was in gryffindor with my new friend sirius black i had to put my hand over my mouth to prevent a chuckle from escaping when i remembered how unbelievably terrified i had been at the prospect of hogwarts mcgonagall had wasted no time scaring the crap out of me professor slughorn who has long since retired wanted to make me part of his elite club of slugs but discovered i wasntexactly a catch and dumbledore wasted no time in making me feel like he knew things no one should ever know especially with that knowing look when i tried to deny something i had clearly done the doors of the great hall opened and mcgonagall appeared looking older then i had ever seen but still hadntlost that look of authority in her emerald green robes and her hat with that feather stuck in it before i begin to describe my son and his cohorts with sheer joy and excitement let me point out that i had spotted the potions master sitting at the staff table and this particular potions master just happened to be my worst enemy severus snape the biggest slim ball and git to ever set foot on god good earth and next to him was quirrell whom both my son and i had met at the leaky cauldron now i can start ranting about harry he looked marvelous in his hogwarts uniform like his proud old man he looked nervous as he walked alongside a boy i immediately recognized from kings cross as being a weasley a fact that didnttake much thought to figure out with flaming red hair and freckles my son looked nervous beyond belief like i had my first day i knew the overwhelming feeling of the staff table the elite headmaster sitting there eyes twinkling his eyes drew towards the magical ceiling that reflected the sky outside and they gleamed i smiled my son was back where he belonged i was too caught up memorizing his face when the sorting hat began speaking to pay attention to what it was actually saying his expression was absolutely wonderful and better to observe then the old talking hat my former transfiguration teacher began reading off names of students and one by nervous one they sat on the stool and she placed the hat on their hat and the hat shouted one of the house names of course the houses are named after the founders godric gryffindor ruvena ravenclaw helga huffelpuff and the dreaded salazar slytherin by the way just a tid bit of background on the potters i related to gryffindor from my dad side and ravenclaw from my mother side i was just itching to find out which house my baby boy would be more than likely gryffindor of course a bushy brown haired girl was called and she seemed to be muttering to herself i saw the weasley boy lean towards harry ear and whispered something making him nod with a smile the girl was placed in gryffindor and the house table erupted into applause after a few more g s they moved towards p s finally getting to my son he nervously walked up the few steps and sat on the chair i would ve thought the hat would shout gryffindor or ravenclaw the second it touched his messy hair surely gryffindor since both his parents were in that house and his paternal grandparents it shouldntdebate it that much but it did the hat was on harry head for about ten minutes i knew those ten minutes seemed like a lifetime to the nervous harry finally it shouted gryffindor the entire hall except the green and silver slytherin table erupted into whoops and applause as harry happily jumped off the stool and walked towards the table he flashed a smile towards dumbledore who was actually applauding for him full force but i could swear he was looking directly at me i was drawn away from my son face when the longbotton boy was called and placed in gryffindor he looked nothing like his always brave looking father and beautiful mother i not trying to be mean but he looked like a bumbling fool shame he would ve made such a cunning and charismatic young man if franky got to raise him i frowned when i heard the last name malfoy and a boy with white blonde hair walked towards the stool i knew him immediately the resemblance to his parents was unmistakable narcissia his mother was sirius cousin and his father the asshole named luscious had been in the same year as the marauders i had wasted no time in hating the bastard especially after the stuff he said and called lily i dontthink the hat even touched his slime covered hair but it shouted slytherin before touching his head same was the case for ronald weasley harry new friend who ran towards harry and joined three other redheads that had to be his brothers i rubbed my face roughly with my hands and barely heard dumbledore give his welcoming speech suddenly something shot through my body an urge to get back to lily i had never felt like that before this obsessive impulsive feeling to get to her and hold her and tell her i love her over and over again it was so strong that i actually began shaking i dontknow what came over me where the murderous urgency came from but it didntmatter it was there and it was torturing me i waited until dumbledore sat down and i bent down and whispered i leaving sir i ll floo you tomorrow and he gave a nod only i saw i decided to go out of the front doors so i could pass harry i paused behind him hearing him ask the oldest looking redhead whom the person talking to quirrell was oh that professor snape he the potions master but everyone knows it quirrell job he fancies the weasley boy answered i wondered what had drawn harry attention to the git but i saw his hand slowly reach to his lightning shaped scar and rubbed it i frowned wondering what it meant maybe a habit i shrugged and kissed his head lightly so he wouldntfeel it and i left the great hall passing filch the hideous caretaker and his cat that must have been 100 years old now i walked out of the castle walking down the driveway and paused when i reached the edge of the lake the exigency actually tearing me into pieces well the need to get to my wife and crush her to me along with a want to turn into a stag and begin running around so i thought of something it had been a long time since i turned into the great stag my friends called prongs occasionally i turned into the stag at home in the backyard in the dead of night so no one would see the neighbors anyway i dontknow how quickly they would call the cops reporting two majestic stags standing in the backyard a humongous silver one the other one a dark red color but it felt good to stretch my legs as it were four legs are better then two for running and the heavy pockers on my head didntbother me all that much anymore but oh it felt good to be out of my body my human body i removed the billowy cloak from my back with my teeth and held it there being sure no one would see me since they were all caught up at the feast i ran towards the gates down the winding driveway if a stag can smile this silver one sure as hell was trying to perhaps even succeeding there an enormous harmony that passes through me when i a stag like nothing matters and nothings happened maybe because i out of my body so i not obliged to think about my problems or perhaps the millions of memories attached to the deer made me all peaceful and hippieish inside but it felt good better then anything ever aside from holding lily and talking to sirius or harry i was free for a minute or two as i hurtled down to the gates of the castle and when i turned back to a human there was an idiotic smile on my face that i felt i dissaparated home to find a note from lily on the dinner table next to a bottle of my favorite bear i didnteven need to look at her signature that beautiful handwriting of hers was a trademark hey sweetheart hope you had fun at hogwarts and i dearly hope our son is in gryffindor i may not be back until 9 or so but i want you to meet me in the david bowman football field at 8 30 i ll be the one lying on the grass bring a blanket with out you love love you heaps forever is forever lils i smiled wondering why she wanted me to meet her at the football filed boy is my wife weird but she my life hence my own oddness but i needed to see her maybe even talk to her so i picked up the phone i admit i still sometimes call it fellatony and dialed her office number her secretary picked up and she sweetly directed my phone call to my wife hey sweetie she said hey yourself i smiled sitting on the couch with a loud sigh what up she asked me all signs of her odd behavior that morning gone now nothing i smiled bastard c mon tell me what house what do you think ravenclaw she asked hopefully i chuckled is that what you were rooting for no gryffindor but still would be nice if he was in ravenclaw she sighed but i heard her smile and satisfaction in her voice well i guess he braver then smart i smiled how did he look she asked excited gitty and nervous beyond hell i laughed i heard her muffled voice as though she had put her hand on the speaking end of the phone when she got back to me she sounded apprehensive i gotta go sweetie tell me why you want me to meet you at the football field first i said i ll tell you there i have to go i love you she said hurriedly love you too i ll see you there then i said and she hung up i decided to watch some tv and found an old movie on the muggle device i woke up from the nap in front of the tv to find the time nearly 8 i got me some food and drove like a respective muggle to the other side of town where our only football field was i saw her car parked there and i parked mine next to hers and got out walking into the green field of grass lined with white markers and two massive posts at either end of the field i saw her lying right in the middle of the field looking up at the stars apparently in the dark stadium isntthis illegal i asked walking towards her eh maybe she answered after relaxing her hand it had flown to her pocket to no doubt get her wand she looked at me as i stood right next to her c mon plenty of room just put down the blanket or you ll get sick yes sir i smiled and arranged the blanket on the ground next to her and lay next to her with my head on her shoulders i began chuckling after a few minutes of staring up at the constellations there sirius i laughed i know he been watching me since i got here she sighed talk to me i insisted what going on with you lately stuff she answered lamely like i pressed playing with her fingers with mine stuff she chuckled i flipped on my stomach propping myself up on my elbows and looked down at her talk lils i smiled brushing back a strand of hair from her face promise you wontget mad she asked i heard fear there a fear i never wanted to hear if it doesnthave anything to do with you leaving me then i ll be a perfect gentleman i said firmly she looked pensively at me my eyes bugged you you want to i asked she shook her head quickly i d rather die then i urged lily stared into my eyes with fear and anxiety i wanted to kiss away i 3 months pregnant

a girl call me mav it a nickname i know it hurts lily announced she was pregnant with harry on new years eve when we were all cooped up together with our parents for a party i have never seen her smile that happily speak that excitedly or hug me that fiercely after i could swallow the fact that i was going to be a dad she looked wonderful when she told me about the baby i was happier then a clam i was becoming a dad but now as i stared into her eyes my throat extremely tight so i could sleep i didntsee that glowing expression not the excited smile she looked grip actually like it was the worst thing on earth and she looked at me fearfully something i had hoped to never seen in my entire life james she whispered tears pooling in her eyes j james yeah i managed closing my eyes hoping it was true i asked you re sure i asked she nodded sitting up tugging her knees in front of her chest how long have you known i asked sitting beside her as she looked anywhere but my face three weeks she answered quietly i put my hand on her back rubbing soothing circles on it why didntyou tell me earlier i whispered a little angry at her for not sharing but then again she was drifting away she shrugged i dontknow i i guess i didntwant to make it official by telling you lily for god sakes why dontyou want another baby i asked do you she asked with surprise evident in her voice yes i laughed i want another baby i had to give up one that i couldntraise i want to be a dad again she looked at me with a confused face filled with pain sweetheart dontyou want another baby she slowly shook her head her beautiful dim eyes dropping to her lap you were the one who was planning on having 4 kids babe i reminded her keeping my voice as gentle as possible that was before my first born baby was ripped away from me she said bitterly now i dontwant any kids at all nothing will happen to this child lily voldemorts gone he canthurt us anymore i reminded her he already did his damage she said look james this child i cantlove him or her why i asked trying to contain my own excitement at the prospect of being a dad again i wanted to teach this child everything experience everything i had been denied with harry i wanted to compensate for that empty lost feeling both of us had because harry he was my first love she said with a mirthless chuckle i look at this baby and all i can think is is how harry is missing out on having a baby brother or sister every time i look or think about this kid i ll think about how harry is missing out on having a family this kid isnthappy i want an abortion lily no i said firmly standing up horrified at the prospect of having my son be killed by some drug i want a son i want a daughter i want a big happy family james it not your decision to make she said standing up like i had it not yours alone either i reminded her my voice as sharp as hers if you kill this child we created together i wontbe able to look at you straight in the eye without without hating me she said seeing as how i couldntreally say the words i would rather have you hate me then deny a baby love and nurturing that was a stab in the heart a blow way below the belt as my knees buckled you re willing to risk what you and i have you obviously are she said sharply staring into my eyes with her defying expression i swallowed and nodded thirteen years together people change she said coldly my eyes bugged they were about to jump out of my sockets you dontlove me anymore lily she didntbudge but licked her lips and i got the massage she was drifting away she had already drifted away from me she was miles and miles away from me i was living in a lie i nodded in defeat with a bitter laugh i thought ours was the ultimate love story but oh how wrong i was you re not the only one james she said i sighed does it have to end this way i asked bitterly with a fight it doesnthave to but we have no choice lily sighed i dontsee how else we can get through this i cantkeep the baby i not in love with you anymore and i confused beyond belief i rubbed my face roughly with my hands i thought if i ever was in this situation especially with you i would grovel and beg on my knees shamelessly for another chance but i can t i was never fit to be a parent a mom a wife she said quietly i didntanswer but she leaned towards me resting her lips against my jaw and leisurely sucked it james baby wake up what i asked sweetheart c mon wake up she said still kissing my jaw caressing it with her hand i realized i was asleep and slowly opened my eyes happy that lily was still in love with me still wanted me and she was kissing my jaw attempting to wake me up from the horrible dream i had she was in love with me still she was still there with me she wasntleaving me you alright she asked tracing my bottom lip with my thumb i was on our fluffy green couch in front of the tv that was now playing one of my favorite movies dream just a dream thank god i sighed as she kissed my lips i moaned that feels good i murmured pressing her closer to my body we were both on our couch she was lying in my arms what did you dream about you kept saying no lily please don t she smiled wrapping her arms around my waist i know by that phrase it wasntanything like your usual perverted dreams you told me you were pregnant then you told me you wanted an abortion and a divorce i said realizing now just how stupid the dream and the idea of my love leaving me she chuckled i dontwant an abortion and i dontwant a divorce lily smiled kissing my lips again so you are pregnant i asked looking at her she nodded you lost your memory or something lily smiled running her hands through my hair kissing my forehead seems i did i frowned not remembering one thing after i came home that afternoon ok you came home found the note on the table called me then met me at the football field where i told you i was going to have a baby we came home celebrated and fell asleep on the couch she smiled ah i nodded finally remembering the lost moments of time you have no idea how glad i am this was just a stupid nightmare some cheap shot author came up with and should someone up there be in charge of my life and put me through that nightmare that illusion of how wrong things could go then i want to kill that miserable person you still look terrified lily said i nodded i know the thought of you leaving me just kinda killed me i smiled and gave her one of the deepest kiss of her entire life when i pulled back she giggled get off of me now she smiled as i kissed her neck no i answered my lips still against her neck my head buried there and i didntwant to come out ever yes you re hurting the baby she said and i immediately pulled back laughing she stood up you were the same way with harry she walked away and i caught her wrist when she was over my head about to walk into the hallway towards the library did you say something about being scared about how this kid because of harry yes she answered quietly just scared he wontget the same love as harry did i mean he doesnthave sirius nor remus he wontlive in the hollow and he wontbe in england and you and i will constantly be fearing about the same thing will happen with this baby she let out a ragged sigh i just scared still gripping her wrist i drew her close so she was standing at my head this baby will have the same love the same care and nurturing as harry alright i mean sure you and i will be paranoid and he wonthave sirius black as his godfather but he ll still be ours if that helps any she smiled bending down to kiss me she said it does and walked away i closed my eyes now remembering the day i found out about lily pregnancy with harry it was sort of clich sort of nothing can be clich when it lily and james potter she was waking up every single morning throwing up like there was no tomorrow and i being the dutiful and loving husband would sit next to her on the bathroom floor and hold her hair back while she puked her guts out a few weeks passed and i thought she just caught a flu of some kind causing her stomach to be distressed a week before new years i was sitting at my cubicle next to sirius in the auror headquarters at the ministry of magic pouring over papers potter barked mad eye moody gruff unmistakable voice yes sir i asked turning around in my seat i hadntslept in the longest time as voldemort started taking over more deaths happened more battles more sleepless nights because of nightmares and work he threw a stack of papers on my desk have those filed all nice in triplicate on my desk by the end of the day he said i looked through the stack sir i yelled i cantfinish all this by the end of the day i still working on that damn report for the battle last week in plymouth well then you d better be prepared to stay here for the night because i need that report on my desk by tomorrow as well he said clanking away sirius who was leaning back in his chair his head looking around the wall of the cubicle with a smile playing at his smug lips haha he mocked you have to stay here for the night working on moody reports cause he was feeling moody go to hell i told him standing up i yelled i will not write these reports i have not slept for nearly four days and i have not seen my wife in nearly a month except in the damn morning when she throwing up i was waiting to use today as a day off by finishing this fuck damn report and heading home so sir with all due respect i will not file out these reports i bellowed getting everyone attention in the office as frank longbottom and sirius smiled proudly at me moody looked like he was about to fly and grab my throat never had anyone in his entire life ever yelled at him or defied his orders i was about to be made ferret or worst his foot stool alright potter finish the report on plymouth and you get going he said calmly nodding he looked at the gawking sirius black longbottom take care of the paperwork and he clanked back to his office i just stared after him not believing my ears or eyes neither could frank and sirius i guess what just happened piper asked from behind me her office was right across my cubicle she was standing so she could see over the top of my cubicle at me apparently james potter just yelled at mad eye and you got his assignment sirius looked at me with envious eyes so i get the dubious pleasure of writing your reports in triplicate i beamed at him all you ve been doing these past few days is sitting on your arse except for the occasional duel while i fill out reports about time things changed around here i smiled mr potter i heard a squeaky voice from behind me i looked around to find one of the young aurors looking at me nervously he gave me a piece of parchment and left oo that from your mistress teased sirius wiggling his eyebrows i ignored him as i read the note lily beautiful hand writing graced it saying meet me in the cafeteria in ten minutes i need to tell you something lily i frowned looking at piper know anything about this i asked giving her the note she smiled at me without even reading it of course i do but i not gonna tell you but i your blood relative i reminded her i entitled to hear your honest confession about this yes but i also lily best friend so i not gonna do you the courtesy go find out for yourself she said giving me back the note evil i muttered tell me love sirius said batting his eyes sweetly at her sure she giggled and bent down to whisper something in his ear while i looked enviously at him you re kidding that great he laughed hey sirius come on man he said black and longbottom not just longbottom frank said from his cubicle poking his head around his wall to look at padfoot i shook my head and left them without another word i walked casually to the cafeteria down the corridor from the auror hq apparently we re the only ones that get hungry among the sea of witches and wizards of the ministry sitting at the tables and eating i found my beautiful redheaded wife among the sea of black and brown hair hey i said putting my hands around her shoulders and kissed her cheek she stood up and turned in my arms hey she smiled her eyes oddly bright what did you want to tell me i asked putting my arms around her waist well you know how i er sorta have been sick lately she asked slowly i nodded well i went to st mungo this morning turns out i uh i well i kinda pregnant she smiled sorta pregnant i asked how pregnant two months she said drawing in a deep breath we re going to have a baby i asked in a hoarse whisper yes that what you wanted isntit she asked suspiciously gazing into my eyes like she was reading my mind y yeah i stuttered and began laughing like a maniac yeah that what i wanted i yelled getting everyone attention i gonna be a dad i asked lily laughed along with me yes she began laughing harder when i picked her up in my arms kissing her as passionately as i could when i lowered her to my level she threw her arms around my neck i could feel her tremble with happiness as was i and i held her close thinking that two people were in my arms now not one i also realized that i wasntgoing to live for myself now whatever i did whatever i said what decision i made was going to be for my child and i accepted that horrifying responsibility with bravado presently i was helping lily and piper out in the kitchen as they cooked by sitting on the counter with a book in my lap i was reading about dementor as usual trying to get my best friend out of prison we had discovered that animal and human emotions were different and dementors couldntread animal emotions that was a good discovery and sirius could turn into padfoot whenever he began feeling over depressed they never knew the difference between padfoot and sirius hey babe taste this lily said holding out a stick spoon red with sauce at it tip i allowed her to put it between my lips and smacked my lips enthusiastically mmm i smiled good really doesnttaste like crap piper smiled looking at me did you cook it i asked her no she shook her head then no it doesnttaste like crap i smiled ducking as a dish towel was hurled my way play nice children lily said warningly you re gonna be saying that to a real kid soon i pointed out going back to my reading i thought i already was lily smiled smiling broadly as i glared at her what do you want it to be lils boy or girl asked piper adding a bunch of seasoning to the already delicious sauce girl i think she answered harriet i teased regretting the word immediately after it escaped my lip since we found about her pregnancy three weeks ago now piper and i even sirius were trying not to make her sad like she usually became when we hinted something about the baby brother to my great delight she laughed i wanna get away from h s what do you want to name it if it a girl asked piper distractedly lily looked at me and i smiled knowing she remembered our pact a week before harry was born when we were arguing about names the pact was that if it was a boy lily named him if we had a girl i would name her james decision lily smiled oh yeah piper smiled well then prongs i nearly jumped at my nickname nobody really called me that anymore i was james even sirius called me james now depression had ravaged every inch of him um i thought hard what about helen lily made a face no h alright how bout linda i smiled my wife beamed my cousin nodded approvingly then turned to lily what about a boy she thought for a minute oo what about gregory i snorted lets leave dead relatives out of this please i smiled knowing she referred to my grandfather alright john she suggested doable i nodded what else um matthew she smiled you re going with jesus disciples but i like matthew i nodded good then he ll be matthew and if it a she then linda piper said excitedly clapping her hands together i scrunched up my face how about rose for a girl that even better lily laughed right then in a few months either a rose potter or matthew potter will be running around this house piper giggled i laughed should be an interesting ride two old farts raising a baby lily raised an eyebrow at me i thought you said people were old when they hit 100 well that was only to soothe you i smiled i an old fart but you re not i older then you she said dryly but men age quicker i pointed out literally pointed you guys haventchanged one bit piper smiled and you have i smiled looking at my cousin you know what this moment would be perfect absolutely perfect if

them having a kid yeah lol disclaimer still aint mine ch 12 the soul you cut it was wednesday night i was on my back in the living room with lily thigh serving as my pillow as we reminisced about harry flying skills we had just returned from his flying lessons yesterday and thanks to our busy schedules we just only had time to sit down and talk nothing in my life ever made me as proud as i was when i saw harry fly i dontknow exactly how things reached the climax they did but all lily and i saw was harry zoom up like a profession flyer a few hundred feet and with the skills of a seeker dove for something small the smirking and obviously vile malfoy boy had thrown minutes later mcgonagall had appeared and asked him to follow her we had just gotten word that harry a first year and first time flyer who didntknow what quiddich was had made the house team as a seeker needless to say both his godfather and i were bursting with pride a true smile appeared on sirius face hinting at his face that so many people had worshipped my heart swelled when i saw him fly up yell at the malfoy boy to give back whatever it was he had that belonged to the longbottom boy as i said i dontreally know what happened because lily and i were late because she was doubled over in the bathroom throwing up but god the pride the satisfaction i felt knowing that it was my blood running through his veins what do you expect i smiled the music lily had put on long forgotten as we enjoyed each other his father was a beater so was his godfather his godmother and kat were chasers and his mother was a keeper she laughed better then any music i ve ever heard the legendary gryffindor house teams she chuckled those are some of the best memories of hogwarts i have how could you not i smiled remember at practice remus used to use the excuse of sirius and me to talk to kat or the few times sirius and i crashed into whomping willow hmm i sighed great memories that was fun especially when remus and p peter came to the practices that was just entertaining moments she nodded yeah harry gonna have so much fun with seeker i smiled frowning i asked who was our seeker anyway frank longbottom for a few years remember then the slytherins jinxed his broom and he never played again remember she asked after that our seekers sucked the other side usually used to get the snitch but we d win anyway with your keeper skills and padfoot and my savagery darlin those other houses didntstand a goddamn chance i smiled turning my head in her lap i looked at her steadily growing belly and you my boy or girl will learn quiddich straight from your old man and hopefully someday play with your big brother that would be great lily said heaving a sigh when did dumbledore say is their first game day after halloween i answered urgh halloween she sighed yeah that what i said let hope he has better luck with it then us i said i dontremember ever spending one good halloween since i started going to hogwarts me neither it a curse i guess she shrugged perhaps i yawned lets hope so after a few minutes of silence on both our parts and i listened to the old lyrics of frank sinatra cuz you know you fool there aint no chance to win why chose your mentality wake up step up to reality and each time i do just the of you makes me stop just before i begin lily had gotten me into frank sinatra when we started dating she was and still is a hopeless romantic the last night of hogwarts at about 3 in the morning after the marauders and the girls had stopped celebrating in the common room we had sneaked for a party of our own with the marauder map in tow i took her to the room of requirements and we danced the night away you know what she asked hmm i asked i want to kiss you till you drop dead lily smiled i looked at her and chuckled god forbid i drop dead in the middle of a kiss sweetheart i said i raised my hand and cupped the back of her head lowering her head amen to that she smiled right before i kissed her the dream never left my mind the heartache i endured during the dream still haunted me every time lily touched me and it recurring unfortunately so i have been waking up in the middle of the night moaning out lily name not in a wet dream but a mind and heart wrenching separation and every time she wrapped me in the security of her arms i would thank god that she was mine that she wasntleaving me that she still apparently loved me still well one thing led to another and i ended up sitting up on the couch with lily straddling my waist her head back with her mouth open my smile never left my lips nor did i want it to because i was happy here in her arms forever protected by her enchanting intricate web of love but that didntmean she wasntdrifting away from me making me realize my worst fears she was keeping to herself not talking to me about anything that was too deep what you re seeing just now well reading about is something of an improvement from the past few days we would talk about different things at the dinner table and have the most uneasy conversations when piper wasntthere she would make sure to keep our conversations light about work and how harry was progressing and when i brought up the subject of how this baby was going to grow under our care and my watchful eye so that no harm would come to him or her her spine stiffened she didntlike discussing it future if it didntinclude her first born like just now about quiddich i think she feels guilty about this baby being with us in our care and under our eye she felt guilty and sometimes i even think the smallest bit of hate for the baby because he she wasntgoing to meet the same fate as harry he wouldntbe wrenched from his parents arms the worst part about this theory is i donthave a confidant to tell it too sure there sirius begging me to tell him what bugging me but c mon he in azkaban telling him my unsolvable problem is like asking a man in a hell hole for a cup of ice water it just isntdone if you ve got a brain and piper w still haventexactly gotten over the tension i admit my mood has darkened terribly in these past few weeks since the dream i think and watching my son fly today and know that he will play quiddich hoping his dad could watch well that just left a huge hole in my heart i watched him today knowing that i wouldntbe one of the yelling fathers in the crowd when he played the day after halloween and it ripped me sent me to hell and back but the baby growing in lily womb kept my mind from going completely dark he or she was a tiny burning light bulb in a world of such unbelievable darkness the next morning lily left me asleep in bed for work with a kiss on my cheek and had murmured i ll see you later i was asleep until about 10 40 in the morning i had no distractions and i was exhausted but the weird part i was still sleepy by 3 i had a sandwich next to me as i sat in the library reading up on dementors but i woke up oh shit i yelped looking around me like a maniac trying to find someone to tell oh my god i yelped jumping up and down with the heavy book in my hands i bustin you out siri padfoot that was the answer padfoot the big black dog was a dog all this time it was in front of my eyes right under my nose and i hadntseen it well that may have something to do with the fact that i thought an animagi mind was still human still readable by dementors but my god but when sirius or i switched to our respective animagus forms our minds transformed too that why sirius hasntlost his mind that why he not affected i was jumping up and down like i was the day harry was born sirius at my side i hopped like a rabbit upstairs to get my mirror to tell my best friend that i was going to bust him out soon enough sirius hey sirius you there mate i asked where else would i be he grumbled his horrifying wasted features appearing in the mirror how you holdin up i asked him sitting on the edge of the four poster bed he gave me a look that told me to never ask him that again what new i beamed at my best friend and former roommate i just found a way to bust you out sirius dull gray eyes bore into mine how well dmenetor cantsee right and they cantfeel an animal even when he an animagus i laughed but stopped when he gave me the same look i could ve told you that you dip wad he said without any emotion well then why haventyou used it all this time i asked him cocking an eyebrow at him because i cantjust waltz out of here james use your brain he said angrily whose gonna see you the prisoners the aurors fudge on his daily tour mate no prisoner in that damn place will even look out of their cell door no auror are stationed there and you can slip away from fudge easily all you have to do is creep past the creep or leave after he comes i looked at him he was still skeptical sirius this is the only way out you have to trust me what if they catch me hmm ever thought of that he asked coldly the dementor have been after me since i came here on fudge order they can give me the kiss if i step out of the line in anyway i d rather suffer with my soul then without one i nodded i understand padfoot but god it the only way i can think of i dontwant to risk it i know it really stupid to say that but damn it prongs i can t he said he didntsound angry just numb more numb then i felt yeah i ll keep looking into it k he nodded dontthink i dontappreciate this i didntlet him finish dontfinish that this is nothing compared to what you ve done for me he gave a tiny smile never mention it right how piper he asked she good i nodded she and lily are going to the local mall to look at stuff for the baby today good how lils i nodded again good i guess tell me something has piper changed he asked after a few minutes of silence we ve all changed sirius we re not the na ve tweekers we were 15 years ago i sighed no ones the same after what happened he scoffed you dontsay i sighed she the same person she was years ago but it me that changed she still her crazy hyper and optimistic like she was years ago but i not that bright eyed bushy tailed dork i was back then you think if what happened hadnthappened you would have changed i mean do you think you and i would still be bright eyed and bushy tailed he asked with a loud sigh as though he was tired it was his last stand i shrugged maybe i dontknow i said we would have had a lot of kids running around and with the two of us as their dad i chuckled letting the sentence fall he grimaced but i think he tried to give me a smile that wasntthere yea probably raising hell now more then likely i nodded looking into his eyes you d better go prongsie he said quietly no no i said quickly you re bored i bored let just talk like the old days padfoot the old days are gone mate you just said it yourself he sighed you go back to whatever you do when you re bored i talk to my best friend always have i interrupted no matter how much things have changed no matter what hell we ve endured you ve always been there for me let consider this payback he looked at me there nothing you and i can talk about james only on rare occasion do i hear james come out of his mouth but lately it been frequent i dontknow what going on there there no discussion to have so we ll reminisce i shrugged trying to prove to him that there was no difference where we were he was still my best friend my mate to till the end and i wasntgoing to let him just drift away from me like my wife was i needed someone who knew me in my life someone who didnthate me sirius puts a difference between us now when we were always equals in our youths but now now he thinks i better that i more sophisticated i dontknow what he thinking all i know right now is i need him to be there without really being there i ll only remember the horrible memories he said looking into my eyes at least you ll talk to me i said what going on with you sirius asked me with a cocked eyebrow if there was something wrong you re the last person i d want to tell i smiled and realized to late it was the wrong thing to say i mean i just dontwant to burden you with my stupid problems what are friends for james he asked his mischief obvious in his voice the old sirius black mischief i smiled at him what you re doing right now that exactly what friends are for and they re for listening and helping your best friend lie to his wife or girlfriend about their whereabouts and lying to mcgonagall after we levitated a few slytherins to unhealthy heights and turned a certain group of slytherins into pink haired banjo players and most of all to maraud the areas that no one ever has considered marauding i laughed he always said that it was sort of motto with the marauders but peter never remembered it hey by the way do you have the marauder map he asked no i shook my head i gave it to dumbledore hoping he ll someday give it to harry idiot you gave the headmaster the marauder map i smiled if harry gets it you ll be thanking me buddy boy what about the cloak i have it but i thinking of sending it to harry as a birthday present maybe he can carry on our legacy i smiled yeah he nodded how old would emlyn be now same age as harry i d imagine i said my spine stiffening noticeably he never mentioned emlyn ever a ghost of a sad smile crossed his wasted waxy face they probably would ve been the same class and house more then likely i told him probably made the house team along with him too beater like her old man he barked i smiled at him remus may have been married and have had a few kids by now and the marauders would ve been back on their feet probably we d be getting letters from dumbledore and mcgonagall everyday he said and you know they do need a remus to keep them level sometimes remus only succeeded sometimes i chuckled sometimes he could be worst then us true i nodded very true the kids if what happened didnthappen would drive us up the wall you know that he asked worrying us half to death i nodded our conversation was interrupted with the front door banging open downstairs james i heard piper panicked voice yell from downstairs giving sirius one last glance and concluding that he was panicking as much as i was i dashed downstairs nearly slipping on the carpet pipe what is it i asked oh james she whimpered her shoulders shaking as i flew the last of the stairs what happened i asked immediately knowing that something had happened to lily she was shaking so hard her shoulders hunched over as she stuffed both her fists in her mouth making me wrap my arms around her lily she she wanted to go to the mall right after work so i went to pick her up and we went oh god james she fell down the stairs her trembling increased with mine she in the hospital why the hell didntanyone call me i yelled you wouldntanswer she said my heart dropped into pieces for the millionth time and i was collapsing my world darkening my life was in the hospital and without another word i dissaparated to lily an hey wow lol jimmy potter mind isntone to dissapear eh thank you all so much for the support i am just going through some stuff found out things that you should never find out but i putting them far back in my mind and i hoping it wont come back and bite me on the ass for me to sit here and individually thank each and everyone of you will take way too much time but know this each reviewboosted my jimmy potter mind and i dontthink the people of ff like us authors responding to our reviewers but know this you guys rock keep the encouraging words coming because i need em rock on btw sorry about any mistake you may have found i was in a hurry to get this up love you disclaimer monkies may or may not have flown out of madonna butt but i still haventseen pigs fly ch 14 drain the cup dry i was on the couch three months later on my back with nina sleeping soundlessly on my chest she had assumed her big brothers position and my hands had slipped almost automatically to her back and the other cupping her diapered bottom she was on her stomach her fists holding a handful of my t shirt i was smiling at the white ceiling of our living room enjoying the feeling of the little body on my chest enjoying the peace that was there before she woke up wailing again like all babies do lily was at work still paranoid about the baby weight only she could see to me she was the beautiful angel i loved and will forever and even though i took care of nina whether lils was home or not nina wasntat all neglected in the love field so much had happened and i wanted to explode my brain as i tried to keep up halloween had been the most interesting of them all it concerned a certain incident that included my one and only adventurous son a certain redhead and know it all and a mountain troll good combination right it is if you re not the adventurous son over protective father my son at the tender of age 11 with no prior experience nor knowledge about the wizarding world had survived the attack of a mountain troll then again he survived voldemort the day dumbledore delivered the news about three days after nina birth the incident filled my mind with temporary distraction from spending the entire day at the hospital with the baby in place of that heart clenching concern for nina pride and concern of my firstborn health occupied me and i was thankful for the first time harry had gotten my mischievous streak according to dumbledore a troll had been allowed into the castle but quirrell the professor who spotted the troll had said it was in the dungeons but the fun part is the troll was in the girls bathroom and apparently hermione granger the bushy headed girl i had seen talking to harry and warning him during their flying lesson had gone after the troll naively thinking she could take him on because of all she d read about them she d risked her neck in the line of pure stupidity and my son had gone to her rescue with the weasley boy i was quite amazed at the paternal concern and anger that suddenly overtook the pride i had felt after hearing the news it was weird but i was angry at harry for being so frivolous and so much like me to go rescue a stupid damsel in distress if i was his father i mean like involved father he would ve gotten an howler in less then two seconds with such scolding words of warning that it would freeze him on the spot i was basically thinking how dare you scare me to death like that harry dude being a father of a preteen is harder then i thought i only thought harry would scare me when he was a baby never when he grew up but apparently they scares you most when they re growing and lily has assured me that nina will be a lot like her brother for that i wasntthat thankful how much i had come to love and depend on this little girl is almost baffling she looks a bit like harry lily sharp nose and her bone structure was all she inherited from her mother her eyes were the same color as mine unlike harry they are my midnight blue colored eyes she looked like a black haired angel from my point of view nestled into my chest peacefully having been sleeping on my back for over an hour i squirmed to a new position causing nina to make a cute disgruntled sound sorry babe i whispered watching her for any signs of awakening she went back to her comfortable position and i settled back thinking thanking everyone who knew about nina had shown so much love for her the lost love the missing love of remus kat and sirius lack of presence was almost filled by dumbledore and piper though dumbledore approach towards her was a little more subtle then her jumping godmother who did all but faint when she laid her eyes on the dark headed angel and nina cooed every time she saw sirius in the mirror never minding his wasted good looks never fathoming how much he would ve loved her had he not been so far away she didntmind she seemed to love sirius despite his haggard appearance and after all he is her godfather sirius had been thrilled to hear that i had a daughter and was even more thrilled to hear her middle name though i could see tears in his sunken eyes my butt hurt again and i squirmed under my daughter she didntwaste her precious time protesting sorry sweetheart but my ass hurts i slowly sat up my hand still under her butt and my hand supporting her back her head slumped on my shoulder and i slowly stood up i went up the stairs slowly taking care not to move her too much her bedroom was the room directly connected to lily and mine so we didnthave to travel much to reach her at night when she wailed and using our old friend magic we had busted a door from her bedroom to ours in the wall that connected us i paid little attention to the artwork and decoration her mother and godmother had decorated her room with although they were quite remarkable though it was covered with little teddy bears with a light green background they had used the old charm they had learned when they were decorating harry room like nina s harry nursery had a wolf a dog a stag and a rat who disappeared when the human form wasntin the house for example if i was at work and sirius had slipped out and had gone to lily for food with remus a dog and a wolf would appear on the wall and right now a stag was the only thing that appeared there waiting impatiently for padfoot and moony to follow suite i prayed and hoped that they would join the doggy one day he was way too lonely and lily refused to add a female dog there with a red coat nina only protested slightly as she was put in her bed her tiny hands in fists in form of a surrender her head to one side with her eyes squinted close using the same spell lily had taught me when harry was born i went to the library again the spell was to set off my wand when nina cried very efficient for the parent and the baby i went through my books in the library looking for the one whose singular passage had been pounding my brain for the longest time i found it an old favorite of sirius s a tale of two cities though i didntenjoy the book as much as others there was a passage there dialogue which shook me every time i read it buried how long eighteen years you had abandoned all hope of being dug out long ago you know that you are recalled to life they tell me so i hope you care to live i cantsay and selecting the answer that fit my imagination from the three choices offered shall i show her to you will you come and see her i dontknow her i dontunderstand with a hollow bitter laugh i dropped on the leather couch with the book in my hands finally understanding why i was drawn to it sirius my best friend sirius was the man that was answering the questions i asked him he was buried and soon i would recall him to life hopefully soon and i would ask him those questions and his deadened eyes would stare at me lifelessly as he answered me i so torn with the fact that my life was starting to finally work out happiness was finally coming to me the thing that tore me to ribbons was that for the first time i couldnttruly share it with my best friend and that hurt more then anything else it just sort of felt wrong not to see him play with nina or tease me about having to change diapers he and i have always shared our happy moments together it weird for him not to be here corporeally the library door opening got my attention and lily entering the room provided a wonderful distraction from my thoughts hi she said brightly leaving the door open as she advanced to me i looked at her with a smile hi i said as she sat next to me on the brown leather couch nina asleep she asked pulling out the pin that kept her hair in a bun i watched in rapt attention as it fell to her waist like a red waterfall it looked so soft i couldntresist reaching out a hand to play with a stray strand yeah i answered smiling sensually at her as she gazed down at me sprawled on the couch with a tale of two cities on my chest was she fussy she asked running a finger up my chest making my sigh no pretty quiet actually i frowned still playing with her hair she asleep long she asked watching her fingers as they trailed lightly down my shirt i closed my eyes as the feather light sensation of her finger drove me nuts as always not really maybe fifteen twenty minutes looking at the fire in her eyes i looked at her curiously what do you have in mind sweetheart with a coy smile she tried unsuccessfully to suppress she giggled i ve been thinking about you all day she murmured suddenly turning shy and staring at her fingers instead of my eyes oh i asked curiously softly knowing what it did to her she nodded james she asked after a few minutes of silence i enjoyed staring at her face as she played with my shirt running her fingers down the crevices beneath hmm i asked her gaze turned up to meet mine i love you i smiled at her and couldntresist wrapping my arms around her waist and drawing her to me how much i asked with a smile my lips an inch away from her as she placed her hands on my chest her breathing seemed to become shallow as i pressed her verbally without limit james beyond forever promise i asked she nodded with a smile kissing my chin how bout you she asked lifting her head to look into my eye slyly looking into her exquisite emerald eyes i could see all her love for me shine in them i suddenly remembered the first time i saw her on the platform in front of the hogwarts express looking so nervous despite her efforts i remembered the first time i made her laugh right after we were grudgingly assigned together for a potions project and it blew up in our faces i still remember the purple faced beauty laughing as i made stupid comments i remembered in those reflective eyes the times when she would admittedly laugh at something i did then stop abruptly remembering she hated my guts and i remember that special night as i sat frustrated ready to strangle peter and she asked me to speak with her privately and the bliss i lived in after that night she admitted to loving me with all her heart although grudgingly but oh all these years i ve been with this women and all those foolish times these past few years when i doubted i have never stopped loving her for one second and i would never stop till my last breath what do you think lils i asked pushing back a tendril of her hair her eyes softened remarkably making me drown in the passion they displayed the love i had for her pounded through my every pore i just want to hear you say it james she said softly i looked at her and smiled i love you lily i whispered she gave a genuine smile and reached for my lips asking you think nina ll be up soon shacking my head i let lily wrap in the intricate web of her undying love for me hence me finding myself on my back on our bed upstairs with the very naked lily using my chest as a pillow a sated feeling pounding through both of us with a sheet covering us from the waist down we enjoyed each other immensely as i mentioned earlier lily still has the mother figure and i incalculably happy about that i gonna go check on nina she said silently my hand moving up and down her back alright i said just as quietly and cursed silently when she got off the bed the cool air surrounding me immediately without her i smiled to myself once she left our room with her peach colored robe on turning to sleep on my stomach never having been accustomed to sleeping on my back without lily i nearly laughed out loud in the pillow in the middle of all this misery all this shit i being put through by some unseen force i still managed to smile and feel my heart flutter every time i thought about the fact that i had a daughter now and i loved my wife more then ever and dumbledore keeps telling me that someday soon harry would rejoin us looking at the picture of harry on the nightstand i suddenly began to go over the problem that had invaded my thoughts for a while now what to get harry for the fast approaching christmas it was already december 22nd the air in england and turlock were freezing and everyone on earth was hunkering down for the happiest time of the year for four or five years now i d been giving him birthday and christmas presents from atticus this year i decided i would be giving them to him just not putting any name on the presents for his birthday i hadntbeen able to give him anything this year unless you count the money in the vault lily and i left him but that didntsatisfy to make up for that now i wanted to give him something he would always remember for some reason a thought kept nagging at me to give him something that i valued to pass on to him something from his father would maybe make him feel less lonely that why i ve been thinking of something i value deeply the first thought was my wedding ring but i sorta think that stupid to give your 11 year old son second choice was a photo album but i wanted to give him something more then that something i valued and loved more i was thinking of an item that had significant memories for me something that had been present when something important happened to me something unbelievably significant i knew it had do be something involving the marauders whom had been a large part of my life it had to of course include memories i cherished with lily with that object present and my parents harry grandparents it was like lightning struck i sat up so fast with the idea flashing brightly in my mind i smiled then scolded myself for not having come up with it sooner dolt that i was i couldntremember one of the most important objects in my life this particular item was given to me by my father and had been passed down from one generation of potter to the next mischievous one since before the middle ages starting with bartholomew potter who bought it it had taken a significant part in our marauder days and saved our necks during and after hogwarts i even mean during the first war lily and i often used this object to sneak out and share a privet minute or two by the lake just to talk or to share affection i started to chuckling silently as i stood up wrapping the white sheet around my waist i walked towards the walk in closet turning on the little light in the over sized closet full of our clothes lily dominant in quantity i knelt down beside one of the two trunks that lay on the ground with the initials jp on it unlocking it i began rummaging through various memorabilia i had kept from hogwarts i smiled brightly when i found the beautiful billowing silvery invisibility cloak that had survived countless potter pranks wars and heavy passion this was perfect for harry of course he would use it to get into trouble but ey he the son godson and surrogate nephew of the marauders i picked up the cloak and walked back to the bed with it in my hand sitting at the edge and staring at it released countless memory rushes sirius peter and myself huddled up under it running slowly across the lawn of hogwarts under the full moon to join our friend when he needed us the most i remembered every time lily and i sneaked out of the castle for a few stolen moments when we discovered that we could actually be very intellectual companions to each other i remember one time she and i decided to go and have a picnic by the lake the last week of 7th year it was as romantic as i could make it which was pretty romantic her eyes sparkled like champagne in the moonlight setting my heart to beat with a newly found passion we had talked about our plans for the future she was signed up for training as a healer and i was going to the auror training academy and on to living with sirius black and remus lupin in a shabby apartment in london it was decided as lily came back to me with the news that nina was sound asleep and began massaging my bare shoulders i would give my baby boy the invisibility cloak the next morning i woke up early with the sound of nina cries and the beds weight shifting as lily hastily went to our daughter i lay a little disoriented for a while never having been a morning person and was never able to speak in full sentences until 9 i sat up and almost instinctively went to the writing desk in the corner of the room picking up a piece of parchment and a quill i began writing the following note your father left this in my possesion before he died it time it was returned to you use it well i didntsign a name and left it a mystery to harry and i had no doubt he would somehow link it to dumbledore and lose the trail after telling a protesting and pretty happy lily about giving the cloak to harry i wrapped it up and went to hogwarts to give the present to dumbledore to put it under the tree for my son i ve never been happier what do you think sooo sorry about the late update you guys but i ve been sooo unbelievably busy with school and life and stuff and i writing a short about lily and james wedding for those who know alan alda the actor writer producer dude he my hero and i got to meet him on friday he has wanted to be a writer since he was 8 he 70 now and he just published his first novel never have your dog stuffed i recommend it i went up to him and told him that i a writer and he told me to promise him to keep writing so i gonna do that and try to do my homework and that so i need you all to have patience even though it not a common virtue please please have patience i ve come up with a concept for the story that has me going to back to read books 1 5 since i already wrote six and it still on fresh on my memory patience i love you reviews posted on my bio page shout out to neurotica ch 15 fade in fade out it was about 4 in the morning and nina started to cry indignantly for her mother breast or helping hands to change her poopy diaper which ever it was nina could be rest assured that mommy and daddy werentvery happy about waking up nina go back to sleep i called as lily grabbed her robe and jogged towards the door to nina bedroom i stuffed my face in the pillow again with a humph i always get extra sleepy in winter time i dontknow why but it like my trademark or something just like not being able to put together two and two before 9 it had gotten so bad that naptime wasntjust for nina anymore every time my little girl is too tired and starts falling asleep i waste no time curling up next to her she become a great excuse the chicks on the block go absolutely insane when they see me with her the girls held this little chindig for lily and i had taken nina out for a stroll to the nearby university when we got home all of the neighborhood women swarmed me and nina who was in those little jumper thingys they started cooing about how adorable i looked something about a man looking downright sexy when he puts down his virility for his baby seriously why wouldnti and who the hell came up with the concept that i virile not that i enjoy the term but still ugh let give it up i not modest i virile i manly i sexy that why the women love me i ll shut up now k i know what you re thinking and i thinking the same thing my attitude towards life changed by multitudes since that day at the hospital i thought lily would die i thought i d never see my b beloved again kiss her hold her in my arms i had thought in those almost foolish moments about the thousands of days i grew old and lily stayed forever young in my memories and to have her and nina with me now who in their right mind would be depressed i fell in love with lily again more deeply i was almost asleep when lily came back nina back to sleep again i began to laugh breathless when she straddled my waist and began massaging my back i smiled at her new sense of sensuality which had only improved since christmas three months ago she went back to sleep almost immediately lily murmured in the dark her fingers kneading my shoulder and back muscles making me clamp my eyes shut and suppress a moan good i breathed holy crap lily i breathed as her lips landed at my nape after a few minutes of this torture i flipped so i was on top and we engaged in our usual rhythm rocking to pleasure with an explosive sigh the next day i was sitting on the ground in front of the couch with a book in my lap watching nina a play with her newest toy kicking thing with blues clues singing on the tv we were both bored out our wits it was about 1 and father and daughter were getting stir crazy i looked at nina who had grown remarkably and her hair was turning into the blue black of harry and my hair her eyes were now officially the midnight blue of mine she was the most beautiful creature ever i weird i love my two hehe 2 kids more than my wife lily is my life she what i ve always needed but harry and nina they re a part of me my own flesh and blood and i ve never gotten over that and i dontthink i ever will they re a part of me part of me both physically and mentally they re all my thoughts all my decisions you bored nina i asked her kicking stopped along with the music as her gaze turned towards me questioningly sorry kiddo but it too cold to go outside i put down the book and crawled to her and slept next to her on my side playing with the wheel on the kicking thing and so my little lady you and i are stuck here bored out of our wits she giggled watching her dad play with her silly toy i smiled at the expression on her angelic face and couldntresist kissing her head her baby smell filling my nostrils i suddenly heard the flames come to life i sat up to see dumbledore smiling face in the flames hello james janina why he doesntcall nina nina is a mystery of dumbledore hi i smiled helping nina sit up putting her in my lap as is my duty as headmaster and your secret keeper of sorts it my duty to inform you that harry ronald weasley and hermione granger and draco malfoy have all received detention tonight with hagrid dumbledore said almost cheerfully i blinked holding on to nina as she squirmed detention do i get angry or do i whoop in triumph what did he do mr malfoy found them visiting hagrid after hours dumbledore eyes sparkled merrily i assume they used your cloak i blinked again a smile trying force its way past the unbelievable rage how could he be so stupid doesnthe know all the death eaters are after him doesnthe fathom the danger voldemort presents and why in hell is he so much like me why with hagrid his face turned dark there has been a fair amount of dead unicorns in the forest hagrid has found new blood and the four students will help him find the creature i frowned nina was gurgling who would do that can you think of no one who would need the immortality unicorn blood offers james my heart stopped abruptly voldemort i gulped seriously he nodded grimly seems he is lurking about he gotten a whiff of the sorcerer stone i cursed silently but then all the spells and stuff they ll work right headmaster only the wisest of wizards can pass through that maze james he assured me harry is as safe as can be i promise you sighing i nodded my mind still buzzing with harry i never knew till that point just how worried a human can get i was ready to follow harry around for the remainder of the school year and the rest of his life running a hand through my hair i sighed my worst fears realized for now i have to get back to work james take care he smiled and disappeared looking down at nina who looked back with a half smile start praying your brother has a brain babe that night i mirrored sirius to tell him about harry detention a grimace i now took for a smile appeared on his skeletal face he called harry his father son and i nearly wept at the injustice that my best friend in jail it was march now a few weeks after my conversation with dumbledore spring was coming into bloom and so was nina potter we were all relatively happy sitting in the backyard one day when disaster struck we were all in the backyard drinking lemonade while i knelt beside a flower bed my beautiful wife was playing with nina who laughed her own baby laugh james have you ever seen anything as cute as this little kid turning to face her i smiled harry maybe he was different type of cute lily laughed a spark in her emerald green eyes that hadntbeen there since harry birth right i smiled still on my knee lily james i heard dumbledore voice suddenly boom worriedly from the house i dontknow how fast i dashed towards the house my heart had dropped an odd feeling gripping my gut i slid into the house sliding in front of the fireplace to see a passive dumbledore what wrong was my greeting i got a massage from miss hermione granger that harry is down in the chambers trying to save the stone he stared at me for the fraction of a second seeming to know that i needed to swallow the information i dontthink i can stress the danger he in my heart only beat faster when i heard a gasp behind me the gasp of a horrified mother i turned to look at her not liking the wide eyes the trembling lips the unshed tears i on my way i told him dumbledore disappeared with a nod i wasted no time bounding to lily taking her in my arms and kissing her head it alright i crooned go to him better as atticus she told me her voice slightly muffled by my shoulder i love you i smiled turning into atticus i went to harry rescue as atticus evens his ever trusted friend my mind was swimming with terrifying thoughts about disasters that could occur to my son i went to the third floor ignoring the portraits and memories the halls offered i got to the trap door on the third floor to find dumbledore and mcgonagall standing there the three headed dog that had nearly eaten my head off the first time i saw him was asleep as an enchanted violin played merrily professor i said my eyes on the open trap door both their eyes swept over me to dumbledore i was just james potter and he d known me since infancy i just looked a bit different to my old favorite professor mcgonagall i was a stranger about to be trusted with the most important mission harry potter son of james and lily grandson of zach and linnet the latest generation in a long line of powerful wizards hell i was ever overwhelmed with the gravity of the situation more actually since he my flesh and blood i trust you know all the charms and tricks down there dumbledore asked i nodded praying my son was the son of a marauder and lily potter hoping he was powerful beyond reason smart beyond anything because that would get him through and the old paternal anger and fear returned and petrified me who else is down there i asked one foot at the edge of the trap door ready to drop to my son we think it professor snape sir said a quite voice from behind me i finally noticed hermione granger my boys friend i smiled at her sweetly father and turned to dumbledore snape i hissed professor snape is in the dungeons it is professor quirell that missing atticus he said softly i was off even before dumbledore spoke another word how could that stuttering fool be voldemort accomplice that was all i could think dumbledore knowing i would need to know everything about the stone and all the curses and spells around it had told me everything every detail of it existence he had laid down a map for me and all the precise movements and spells i needed to get through the maze without any trouble and i was thankful because i didnthave time to dally at all i didnthave any patience never had and right now the only thing was going to the center of this maze and getting my boy back to safety then throttle him for being so unbelievably flippant with his life i didntnotice the dangers i came across they looked like nothing because all i could focus on was harry and him out and fast i was suddenly standing at the first step to the chamber where the mirror of erised was set with dumbledore trickery but the room was surrounded by a ring of fire and to my disappointment my son was standing valiantly right in front of the fire i looked him over making sure that there werentany missing limbs thankful that there wasn t i followed his startled gaze to see quirrell against the wall his hands covering his face as his face turned to ashes literally i was actually nauseated by the site of human flesh just deteriorating at a rapid pace but something happened that i never thought i would ever see again a wisp of smoke familiar to me from the night voldemort invaded our house rose from the dust of quirrells remains i breathed in a sharp breath that voldemort the wisp of smoke that was him flew right through harry as it had through me his scream was accompanied by voldmorts and my heart wrenched painfully as soon as voldy disappeared i used some cheap trick i had learned when i was training for auroring to extinguish the flames and stepped across the singed cement to harry unconscious body thankful that he was alive and yet i wanted to choke him fool fool i kept repeating as i went to him kneeling down beside him i ignored my knees cracking and put my hand on his cheek tapped slightly harry i asked softly thousands of emotions crushing my throat concern fear anger dread pride joy and other conflicting emotions harry can you hear me emeralds i risked his nickname but i didntcare anything for him to open those eyes d dad he whispered finally groggily my heart did a little dance then immediately ripped in half when i said no atticus harry i whispered gathering his limp body in my arms i picked him up his head on my shoulder you alright i asked as i walked down the steps towards the mirror of erised he looked at me with confused eyes atticus he asked tiredly yeah just hang on to me ok i asked placing my hand on the mirror surface where dumbledore had made into a portkey that would transport anyone with the proper identity to the hospital wing hold fast to me i told him as i felt the familiar tug at my navel and we were standing the hospital wing madam pomfrey ran to us as soon as she saw us with dumbledore at her heals put him here she told me i gingerly lay harry on the indicated bed covered with her familiar spotless white sheets harry groaned a bit when i lay him down and eased into my hand like a cat when i stroked a lock of his hair back i looked up to see pomfrey looking me with a tenderness in her eyes and genuine surprise i if you will excuse me sir she said and i wondered if she thought she saw james potter the boy who landed so many times in her hospital bed with sirius next to him ah poppy i would prefer if atticus remains with harry until mr potter awakens dumbledore interrupted i walked to the foot of the bed watching pomfrey perform different spells and charms and rubbing salves here there on my boy body as i fought inevitable tears i had failed him almost completely harry had faced voldemort at age one and had defeated him sure but lily and i were there i had tried to save him tried to protect him and we both knew what had happened exactly what had happened because it was tattooed on our brains but this time none of us had been there i hadntbeen there to spit out wise cracks to buy time so i could think of a plan i hadntbeen there this time to at least be able to give him the luxury of thinking i would throw my body on his and shield him die happily of course with the curse that had been aimed at him one year old harry eyes bore into me suddenly criticizing my paternal skills i watched his quiet face an expression of pain on his sleeping face as pomfrey rightly fussed over him his hand was burned he was bruised and had managed to twist his wrist not bad for a marauder in training i thought wryly i wanted to grab harry in my arms tell him i was there that i would protect him that i loved him more then life itself pomfrey left us still a tenderness in her eyes when she looked at me i just stared at harry my mind had stopped i was more numb then i had been in a while james dumbledore said softly grabbing my shoulder firmly i turned to face him have you called lily i asked gently my gun wrenching for her knowing just how worried she would get at least i was with him he nodded she was glad to hear you and harry are alright now please share with me your theory about what transpired down there so told him simple really voldemort had found out harry potter was alive and in hogwarts along with a tool he could use to regain his body so he had possessed or rather shared a body with his servant quirrell and so quirrell helped voldy to the stone and harry being a potter went after the stone to protect it and the wizarding world from voldemort for a while longer i smiled to myself knowing i would ve done the same thing if i had been in his shoes sirius would be where ron weasley lay and remus like hermione would enter the wing quietly looking as disheveled as i felt her eyes landed on me and she studied me i gave her a smile ah miss granger i would like you to meet a dear friend mr atticus evens dumbledore introduced hello she said shyly hi i smiled back offering my hand you do you do well thank you she said quietly taking my hand i refused to eat anything or move an inch for the next six hours i just sat there and watched harry he fidgeted muttered something incoherently then quieted then suddenly atticus i heard him ask hoarsely not noticing all the candy and treats his friends had sent him i bravely smiled at him morning looking out the window well noon what are you doing here he asked almost defensively lily boy all business no fooling around i could ask you the same thing kid you re a wizard arentyou he asked quietly i beamed and nodded at him seeing as how as he was struggling to sit up i helped him and ended up sitting on the edge of the bed by him so you knew all along that i was a wizard a flicker of anger lit his eyes i sighed knowing that he would be even more furious when he found out who i really was his father and that we had lied to him yes i did harry but i still me kid i shrugged i still would ve wanted you to tell me he said tiredly i know but dumbledore thought you d be safer i shrugged again dumbledore he chuckled but that a bit weird he sighed i knew he was confused i reached up and cupped his cheek you have no idea i told him remember that first time we met i made you promise me to never to go out in the park alone smiling he nodded can you promise to never do something as stupid as chasing after voldemort i said quietly delving into his eyes he returned the gaze yes he said i nodded then i remembered my promise to dumbledore to go home right after harry woke up good i hold you to that promise buddy i pretended to look at my watch i have to get going now he nodded too i nearly hooted when i saw disappointment i get a whiff of your risking your neck for nothing i ll kick your ass understand i asked he nodded again alright i gathered him in my arms and he returned the hug enthusiastically i held my son in my arms so glad that i could he laid his head on my shoulder years of trust in the simple hug between father and son came out take care of yourself ok keep in touch your owl will know how to find me i whispered in his ear ok he nodded increasing his grip on me and i returned the gesture i swallowed not knowing whether to tell him what was bubbling up love you kid a pause i love you too atticus he said quietly i smiled pulling back i kissed his forehead take care of yourself you too he answered as i stood up bye for now i said and began walking away from him elated happy sated atticus he called i turned to face him remember that time when i was 6 when you told me about your son in the park i nodded did voldemort have anything to do with his his disappearance did he take him away harry asked quietly his green eyes shinning i nodded he did he ripped him away from me then gave me you i smiled and i went home lily flew into my arms when i got home and i told her everything that had happened without hesitation then i kissed her my medicine and i kissed her thoroughly delving my tongue into her mouth exploring ignoring both our tears harry first year ended a phase of my life seemed to end and with his second year another would end an hey kids sorry about the late update but it was faster then last time right as i said school keeping me very busy so have patience and keep your faith in me love you all read recommend and review ch 18 the beautiful letdown it was a week or two before hogwarts started and as i sat watching my little girl play with her dolls i had the sudden urge to go and tell my wife how much i loved her and so i did she was sitting in the study working on some reports for a meeting she had the next day i couldnthelp but fall in love with her again watching her there her face so intense as her pen zoomed across the paper her glasses magnifying her magnificent eyes a finger twirling a strand of hair as she thought hey i said quietly shutting the door and walked towards her hey she answered back setting down her pen and turning in her chair to face me bad timing i asked perfect actually i needed a break anyway or i d start pulling out my hair she said as i knelt in front of her she spread her legs and i slithered in between her thighs my hands on the armrests of the chair dontdo that i said gently staring fixedly at her lips it too beautiful and i love running my fingers through it she smiled have i ever described my wife to you well even if i have i ll do it again she has almond shaped gorgeous emerald green eyes that i can get lose in she has wavy long red hair my fiery angel plumb lips that looked swollen and irresistible her face was delicate and absolutely beautiful with her straight chin prominently delicate nose and you knew when she looked at you you would melt and when she looks at me tells me she loves me or when i on top of her the way she stares at me only for me i can die happy at that beautiful minute my beautiful lily leaned forward and pressed her lush lips to mine my blood boiling the second the contact was made i growled deep in my throat and pressed closer to her as she arched closer dearer to me daddy i heard nina from behind me groaning in frustration i turned around to see my little daughter standing in the doorway not looking at all surprised to see mommy and daddy kissing what up can you play with me she asked sweetheart i working find sirius i told her irritated at her for interrupting my seduction of her mother he just left she said quietly and i hated myself for having said something scornful to her i furrowed my eyebrows what do you mean he just left nina i knew the answer why did i even ask he said he wanted to see harry she said quietly a little protectively my tone with her was probably the reason for that little withdrawal is he crazy lily asked more than likely i said and stood up kissing the top of her head as i did i going after him use the disillusionment charm sweetheart she said knowing there was no way to argue with me about going after my best friend who was dumb enough to sneak into a place where dementors wreaked havoc yeah i nodded and kissed her quickly heading for the door i stopped in front of nina and swiftly picked her up good luck kiss i smiled she giggled and nodded planting a big smacker on my lips that a good girl i said setting her down i walked out of the house into the backyard with piper whom i had contacted in tow behind me that man she grumbled what the hell was he thinking vengeance i answered before popping to hogsmeade the stupid dementors couldntsense animagis as i have pointed out and piper was going through dumbledore fireplace i turned into prongs under the dc dissillusionment charm of course and cantered off through the open gates i stopped dead half past hagrids hut there was the hippogriff they would execute he had apparently attacked malfoy son i so very fond of that hippogriff seems he knows evil when he sees it it was getting dark outside but instinct told me my son and his friends would want to be with hagrid for that moment hey the retards here i heard piper hiss in my ear i looked towards the castle to see dumbledore and fudge walking down the path from the castle with an executioner in tow i turned back to a human to ask her how she found me dumbledore she answered putting her arm through mine so we wouldntget separated her explanation was simple enough the seemed to know everything and nothing could get passed his crooked nose he never ceased to amaze me really there they are piper hissed as the backdoor to hagrid hut opened the three of them out of their robes and into normal clothes sneaked out and hid behind the pumpkin patch next to the hut sirius should be around here i said c mon let go look around we walked up to the natural steps towards the castle our eyes scanning the area for any sign of sirius there was none yet so i decided maybe a visit to moony wouldnthurt we found him in his office odd trinkets hung here and there one of my best friends sat there wearing dark robes sitting at his desk looking at a piece of paper i immediately recognized as the marauder map my heart froze he would ve been able to see us on the map and i dontthink i really wanted him to see us but thank god he was only looking at the area of the grounds smart man i had a feeling he was keeping an eye out for harry thanks to stupid sirius there wasntone professor save dumbledore in the castle who wasnton their toes for any sign of black and harry being his surrogate nephew moony must have felt a greater responsibility i looked at the map over his shoulder to see little dots with names moving about the labeled grounds it had taken the marauders the better part of three years to put the map together and it had proved unbelievably helpful for us especially during the war since sirius remus and i teamed up to make a map of england that was like the marauder map remus gasp made me look at the map and knew immediately why he d gasped a dot titled sirius black just connected with ron weasely and who else peter pettigrew i knew he was going to take ron into the shrieking shack and i gripped pipers hand and dragged her behind me out of the office and out of the castle to the shrieking shack we froze the tree and went down the familiar tunnel memories flooding me but i pushed them aside harry was under the same roof with sirius and knowing that harry had thought sirius like the rest of the world was a murder our murderer for that matter things between godfather and godson couldntbe pleasant that was for sure and there was nothing piper or i could do to stop them i watched helplessly with piper shaking next to me as harry attacked sirius in blazing fury crying out that he had killed his parents sirius let out a chuckle as he was pinned down by my son with his wand in the middle of sirius forehead asking if he would really kill him harry seemed to have this idea that sirius was there to kill him finish the job and when sirius told them only one would die tonight meaning peter his friends took it the wrong way and said that if harry was to be killed then well they would have to be killed too shit i murmured it took all of piper strength to keep me from going to harry sirius hand was clasping his neck and well you dontmess with james potter son no matter who you are the struggle ended with sirius against the wall harry wand pointed directly at his heart those eyes i knew from those eyes that had looked at me as an infant for help wanted to get revenge i knew from that look on my boy face that killing the man who deprived him of his family would take no effort or guilty conscience those innocent eyes that had stared at me so many times begging me for help were now green flames of hatred you killed my parents harry hissed sirius started for a moment looking his godson directly in the eye and gulped i dontdeny it he said weakly but if you knew the whole story they argued for a few moments harry asking that there was nothing simpler then what had happened to his parents and sirius telling him firmly that if he didntlisten he would regret it for the rest of his life and then i heard something that made me take a step back gasp and rely on piper to keep me standing you never heard her did you harry whispered my mum screaming trying to keep voldemort from killing me did you hear her calling for my dad crying you re the reason for all of it i swear to you dearest reader if a bolt of lightning landed on me electrocuted and snape turned into a human being i wouldnthave noticed and if you had stabbed with a knife no blood would come out he remembered lily screams her pleas with me he remembered all of that god almighty the hell the poor kid has to go through every day if only there was some way to protect him and still be able to come out from hiding hold him and tell him that i love him that his mum and i were still alive that those screams from his mum werenther last words hermione cat was on sirius chest and he was trying to push it away but the cat seemed to be trying to protect sirius from harry wand and then things turned very interesting remus lupin walked through the door the ultimate gothic hero i thought as he pointed his wand at harry s murmuring expelliarmus harry wand shot to remus and harry backed away towards ron who was lying on a bedraggled four poster his leg injured apparently remus seemed to ignore them and stood over sirius with a confused expression where is he sirius i was smiling i could feel it the marauder were standing under one roof though two of them didntknow it well i dontknow if sirius knew we were there or not sirius slowly pointed towards a very confused ron and remus expression cleared while harry deepened his anger feuding but then why hasnthe shown himself before now unless i was about to yell good morning remus unless he was the one unless you switched without tell me sirius nodded his gaze boring into remus gaze a tiny smile appeared on remus lips ignoring my son attempt to clear the fog that had no doubt settled on his mind he held out a hand for sirius and he took it i nearly did my happy dance when the two hugged aw the brothers were back and god how i wish i could ve been part of that hug but that hug sort of sent the kids into a frenzy causing hermione to exclaim about how she had trusted remus and had even known that he was a werewolf he took the information lighter then harry had taken the fact that remus and sirius were friends harry was even more surprised to find out the fact that i had been an animagus and sirius black bestest friend it took my two best friends to explain about peter being an animagus and hermione seemed to find the information fascinating and ron kept telling sirius and remus they were mentel for thinking scabbers was peter and it took remus a few times to yell some sense into sirius before he killed peter telling him to wait because harry had the right to know everything i dontknow how long it took but sirius and remus well remus mostly managed to shut the kids up until stupid severus snape interrupted right when they were telling harry about the time sirius tried to kill snape with a prank that involved moony the werewolf i hadntseen the git for 12 years but it seemed he had become uglier gittier and greasier if such a thing were possible and so snivelly tried to kill sirius well threatened him by saying he would turn him to the dementors who wanted to give him the kiss seriously can i kill him like strangle him with my bare hands you dontknow hatred until you ve gotten inside my head and looked for a file labeled snivelly then you would know what hatred was snape wasted no time in binding my two friends and ordered the kids to go back to the castle hermione and harry both tried to reason with snivelly asking if it would hurt to hear the two of them out only to be told to shut up harry did something that made me very proud of him he took his wand and yelled the old phrase that translated into expel arms snape flew across the room and landed on the wall and he was out cold you shouldnthave done that sirius said quietly but i knew he had loved that attack you should ve left him to me so padfoot and moony proceeded to explaining everything they knew about peter to the kids who devoured every morsel of information accepting it bitterly then they started pointing out facts about the rat scabbers like his toe to ron who wouldntbelieve them for a thousand years harry lost his temper and pointed at sirius when remus told him the truth that sirius was innocent he the reason they re dead he betrayed them harry i as good as killed them sirius croaked i saw tears there i persuaded james and lils to change to peter at the last moment as secret kepper instead of me i to blame i know it the night they they died i d arranged to check on peter i wanted to make sure he was safe but when i arrived he d gone there was no sign of struggle though and i knew james and i had a big mistake i set out for your parents house straight away and i saw their house destroyed their bodies big lie but my dear friend a good liar and he had seen our bodies we were all knocked off pretty good i realized what peter must ve done what i d done piper grip on my arm was painful was sirius turned his back on the kids to stare at us i saw tears in his eyes and in remus voice when he said enough of this ron give me that rat so he surrendered the rat and remus and sirius turned him back to human form it took all of pipers strength to keep me from flying across the room and attacking the little piece of shit but oh how i relished seeing him terrified peeing his pants practically he was so skinny so frail and tired and he deserved every pain and torture it was because of him we were all in this mess the three argued and i seriously wanted to pound peter when he finally admitted sort of admitted at least why he d betrayed lily and i to voldemort and so peter began to beg sirius began to explain how he d managed get out of azkaban it was kind of funny but he was a pretty good damned actor i swam as a dog back to the mainland he explained i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwards grounds as a dog i ve been living in the forest ever since i nearly snorted actually he lived in my fridge except when i came to watch the quiddich match of course you fly as well as your father did harry i smiled but harry and sirius looked into each other eyes a staring contest believe me sirius croaked believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed and with that sirius black charm and sincerity that harry believe him and peter seriously pissed his pants after sirius explained he d suspected remus of being a spy which he had everything fell into place and the kids believed the two and sirius yelled at peter for even talking to harry about me telling him how much he looked like me but when remus and sirius raised their wand to finish off peter harry stopped them we ll take him to the castle he said evenly staring at peter who was on his feet begging harry for mercy then the dementors can have you piper and i waited inside the shrieking shack and walked outside when everyone was out sirius and harry were off to the side having their privet conversation smiling i looked at my son and his godfather suddenly my mind conjured up a scene of sirius playing with baby harry on his first christmas they were the same height know i noticed and smiled but trouble began again the full moon shit i muttered and ran to where remus stood his body rigid as he turned into a werewolf sirius holding him as we had always done to lessen the pain of the transformation remus hadnttaken his potion so he was a fully pledged werewolf and he nearly attacked the kids and snape who had come out of his unconscious state to see the werewolf but padfoot intercepted moony nearly killed padfoot but a howl from the forest drew his attention i dashed to the spot i knew sirius to be laying and bent down next to the massive black dog you alright i asked yeah fine peter got away he croaked sitting up i know but i cantgo after him i said i ll go after remus yes yes go he yelled piper here i said and turned into a stag and ran down to the forest i heard his howl and found the werewolf walking around lake hello buddy i thought and in my stag form jumped in front of him he looked startled then the werewolf recognized me and rammed me playfully i not sure if remus recognized me but the wolf sure as hell did i stayed with him throughout the night and played with him we fell asleep under an oak deep in the forest when i woke up the werewolf was gone and it was daylight remus sat there staring at me i realized i was still a stag but damn him he recognized me i mean c mon how many times do you get to see a massive silver stag eh so i turned back to human form and sat indian style in front of remus like a good little boy hello i said quietly am i hallucinating he whispered i looked up at him he was only 34 and looked 60 goddamn it i dontknow but if we are we re having the same hallucinations he dropped down to his knees in front of me is it really you james no i answered seriously staring him in the eye i your grandmother from kent you retard he stared at me you didntdie that night did you just went into hiding because voldemort threatened to kill harry i grinned at him see this is why you re the only marauder that ever became a professor and sirius knew about all of this you helped him escape he said making me happier then hell because i needntexplain everything to him he could put everything together without me lily alive in america with our daughter i smiled we have a lot of catching up do moony he flinched at his nickname daughter america he asked then added thoughtfully we do have a lot to catch up on i chuckled slapping him on the back why didntyou tell me because the people that know are already in danger i didntwant to put your life at risk remus i said the people that know they have to or our hiding would be useless dumbledore i nodded he narrowed his eyes at me piper find you yet i chuckled yeah she was with me when we came i dontknow where she is though i sighed and looked at remus to find him staring at me blinking unshed tears do you know what you put me through you git he asked had to i answered and squeezed his shoulder you have no idea how much i ve wanted to tell you about all this but you re life is more important my sanity actually he said and hugged me ah the marauders are back baby an pardon any mistakes you might find kids but it 12 a m this chapter it a bit boring and i dontparticulary like it but it something that would have to happen but the most important part is the end it sort of a foreshadowing really but you catch it or you don t and dontworry if you don t lol um the fourth book next so yey and you might like that a lot lol keep reading this and recommending this and vicious cycle to your friends rock on mav 19 fly me to the moon currently if you came to out to our backyard you would find the trees had turned color and were preparing for the winter you would find the colors absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing to look at you would find a long haired burnet and a former long haired redhead sitting on lawn chairs the redhead had a little girl with black hair sitting in her lap all three watching the three men in front of them one of the men had sand colored hair one had unruly thick spiky black hair and the other was thin but had long black hair they were staring at each other intently not blinking but narrowing their eyes finally the one with the spiky hair burst out laughing and being on down on his haunches fell back and began laughing you guys are retards i laughed look whose talking remus yelled indignantly standing up and brushing the grass off his pants sirius began to laugh as well staring contests at the age of 35 well know i ve seen everything well we ve seen everything know haventwe i asked drying my eyes sitting on my butt in the grass remus shook his head i thought this was all lost he chuckled sirius stared up at him well we ve been having staring contests since we were 11 i think we ll get the hang of it he laughed knowing fully well that remus meant the fact that we were together again i think so i agreed accepting remus hand and he heaved me up it felt so unbelievably good to have remus in on the secret my god so much of the weight been lifted off my shoulder it incredible sure dumbledore was a bit pissed at me for revealing myself to remus but who cares i happy he happy we re all happy and sirius and i werentthe only ones that wanted to do the happy dance every single second remus seemed a tad happier then us the gray seemed to have disappeared from his sand colored hair life had returned to his blueish eyes and he was happy and you could tell just be the smiles he shot us every time sirius and i made some lame ass comment about something and not only had a wolf joined the stag and dog on nina wall nina herself was starting to adore moony and like harry he had promised to teach her everything from english to math and allow us to do the corruption she loved him and sirius sirius maybe a bit more but you can be sure that she would quietly sneak onto one of their laps and set up camp their for the remainder of the day and with everyone back i was sure had a feeling in my gut that harry would soon join us and would start calling sirius and remus by what his baby sister called them uncle moony and padfoot i couldntwait for him to join his family again and yes despite everything my boy still occupied every single crevice of my mind everything we did our dinners together stupid little backyard events like this one i just wondered what it would be like to have harry with us what would he say what would he do would he laugh maybe call us idiots with a chuckle and join the idiocy himself i miss that kid so much i miss him not being around not being about to see his reaction to his weird yet unbelievably loving family i cantwait for him to join us but thanks to dumbledore i knew he was going to the quiddich cup with the weasley s and sirius and i were unbelievably envious about that tiny little fact the game between bulgaria and ireland is today in fact he should be watching it by know wish i could be there but i know he in wonderful hands and i know he cantbe safer with anyone then the weasleys i wonder if he rooting for ireland he better be oy james you up for a game of poker or something sirius asked then the most evil grin the same that crossed his face when he had a plan of attack against the slytherin appeared on his face or how bout quiddich he grinned i looked at remus whose grin was as wide as sirius s and almost as devilish good idea we can put a charm so muggles wontsee us i began to laugh having missed quiddich and flying around with my friends almost as much as i missed harry and england and wales in ten minutes we had our brooms and the charm was set but we couldntfly over the 80 foot mark piper decided to play with us so it was two on two since lily needed to stay grounded i can hook nina on to my broom put a spell on it so she wontfall i suggested she shook her head it ok you ll be uneven if i play anyway if you re sure i smiled and bent down to kiss those beautiful lips of hers i pulled back chuckling as remus and sirius started to catcall making a very inappropriate gesture with my hand i mounted my broom dolts piper muttered as we kicked off hovering in a circle about 10 feet above ground we had chosen teams already remus and i were together and the two lovers were on the same team sirius piper and i played on the house team at hogwarts we were called the dream team remus occasionally played with us after we goaded him well kat allure always had him up and flying and playing with us in no time sirius and i were called the best beaters the gryffindors ever had and though i used to play seeker for the last two years i adored the beater position and of course my exquisite lily was the keeper while the other two girls were chasers we were not only the dream team those games we had for fun or just competition are some of the best memories i have i even the time i crashed into the whomping willow hehe long story alright so we have one keeper for each team and a chaser but since we two people keeper can go out i explained being the quiddich expert ok children let have our own little version of the cup piper smiled i narrowed my eyes at her you re goin down cousin i ll try not to make an ass out of you in front of your daughter and wife jaime piper said sweetly you better bring it black remus taunted it already been broughten lupin sirius said with a playful growl hey are you guys gonna play nice or do i have to get out my wand lily asked nina wrapped up tightly in her arms as they looked at us we ll behave we promised at the same time which meant the exact opposite lils you re gonna have to toss the ball piper said and she did we set off we laughed more than we played just being around these guys makes my goofy and want do the stupidest things just so we could laugh you give my daughter one time chunk of any type of sugar and she ll be running up the walls well these guys are my sugar james you suck sirius laughed shaking his head from across our little field oh right sirius am i the one who just got hit directly in the head with a quaffel i asked with a cocked eyebrow the retard had seen the ball directly coming for his head and hadntbudged and soon the two of us were chasing each other around but our fun was short lived of course because i james potter and my son name is harry potter and he and i and the rest of the family never get to have any fun james lily called the alarm in her voice made me stop my pursuit of sirius what is it i asked zooming down so i was hovering right above her head the rest coming to soar and stop by me her eyes were so full of sheer terror i jumped off the broom nothing can get those eyes to look so scared unless something unbelievably horrible happened what wrong i asked standing right in front of her swallowing she looked at me then the rest of the guys the dark mark appeared above the campgrounds of the cup a couple of death eaters were seen marching death eaters dark mark are you serious holy shit those were our responsive who said what i dontrecall my ears were ringing harry was all i said he fine she said quickly knowing i was a second from a full blown heart attack he got separated from the group and someone stole his wand the mark was conjured from his wand but he fine he at the weasley s dumbledore made arthur promise to keep checking in with him i dontbelieve this piper murmured dismounting her broom and picking up nina who looked puzzled but kept her mouth shut what could ve provoked them i looked at sirius who was standing next to me his eyes full of unease as i sure mine were i think our little rat has something to do with it i told him more than likely he agreed rubbing his jaw thoughtfully think dumbledore can help us find him piper asked quietly peter could be anywhere remus answered dropping into the lawn chair next to lily plus he more than likely in one of voldmort hideouts we couldntfind them in the first warm there no chance in hell we re going to find him now without any of the members or the spies but if we do find him sirius grinned god help you peter there are what about twenty people in line to kill the little son of a bitch remus asked watch it piper warned when nina giggled at her surrogate uncle profanity sweetie why dontyou go play in your sandbox for now lily asked she had assumed her little nervous position she was leaning forward with her hands pressed between her lower thighs one of her legs moving about nina obeyed as the adults proved to the world they were the most elite members of the order and the triwizards coming up in hogwarts sirius reminded isntkarkaroff the headmaster of durmstrang remus asked igor karkaroff the guy that gave us all the names sirius asked me yeah remember we helped moody arrest him who knows what kind of black magic he teaching at his school i muttered running a hand through my hair thinking that my son was becoming less safe in hogwarts by the second moody gonna be around he the new dada teacher lily said reading my mind as usual and grabbing my hand with him and dumbledore around and obviously us no one will get him and if god forbid they do well they re gonna have to answer to one helluva an angry pack piper smiled maybe we can set off moody on them on a full moon sirius grinned looking at remus who growled and slapped him upside the head who else is going piper asked france beauxbatons lily answered her hand still in mine it run by madame maxime isntshe a ginatesse i asked hagrid gonna be busy sirius said wiggling his eyebrows she safe lily asked we all decided to ignore sirius i ve never heard of her being in league with voldemort she seems alright i shrugged with mood around everyone gonna be pissin they re pants no one gonna try to touch harry with him around and us sirius reminded pointing at lily dontworry about the kid trust me i ve been at his mercy he more powerful then any 14 year old ever should be yeah lils remus agreed he conjured a potronus after only what three tries it took sirius five years to finally make it corporeal watch it sirius murmured angrily we went in after our little discussion lily only a bit reassured about harry safety the dark mark i cantbelieve it back and they re saying crouch elf conjured it what the hell is that all about and with harry wand something going on something unbelievably bad is about to happen and i ll be damned if i tell the others about what i think we had dinner a full table with laughter and stupid comments from all of us and sirius and i occasionally getting slapped upside the head for saying something more stupid than stupid it was like being back in hogwarts again or even after hogwarts when everything was relatively calm when kat was alive and harry was with us and we were all happy and all the corners of our mind was focused on just that one moment and that feeling of family we all thought we d never experience tragedy nor would ever be separated and be reunited as perpetual strangers we loved each other so much appreciated and cared so deeply that life without one another was out of question existence just didnthappen without one of us we were a chain and if one of the links went missing we d all be useless and christmas was one of the top examples of that theory it was harry first christmas with us and the family had decided to gather at lily and my house for the celebration so harry would be closer to his crib we d put up our tree a week or two before christmas but i was up on a chair trying to fix the crooked star on top of our tree the elite guests hadntarrived yet so it was just my dad lily harry and i my son and father were sitting in a comfortable armchair by the fire where numerous decorations hung on it mantel harry was playing with my dad fingers while lily hands on those hips of hers gave me orders no sweetheart that way too far left tilt a bit to the right and we re done she said my right or your right towards the kitchen she simplified and i obeyed no that too much tilt to the left just a bit wait that perfect hallelujah i muttered getting of the chair after i dontknow how long thank you sweetheart she said and planted a quick kiss on my lips what time are the rest supposed to come by the way my dad asked watching his grandson giggle randomly and clap his little hands for reasons only he seemed to understand i know sirius and piper were stuck at hq mad eye was making them double check something on the two death eaters they caught i told him i dontknow what keeping kat and remus and peter just running late lily assured us and herself because we were all in an unending state of paranoia since the war had started and friends were getting killed my mom had been one of voldmorts first victims after he came out three years before that day a few minutes later kat and remus arrived the beautiful redhead greeted all of us with her usual enthusiasm the enthusiasm i miss so dearly to day and makes me wish to god i tried harder to dissuade her from becoming a death eater for the order benefits she kissed me on the cheek hugged lily and my dad and gave a big smacker to my son who flew to her from my dad arms peter arrived next his black coat hidden under a blanket of snow his thinning hair carrying evidence of the white christmas outside ho ho ho kids was piper greetings when she and sirius arrived not twenty minutes after remus and kat she was carrying a stack of presents and quickly put them down by the already massive pile of presents under the tree happy christmas ladies and mr potter sirius smiled evilly staring pointedly at my dad which meant the rest of us were all girls after hugs were exchanged quick embraces promising bear hugs after 12 o clock and even more hugs when we opened our presents dinner was exquisite courtesy of the girl hard work we had everything you could imagine and all of us were asking for seconds on everything on the menu lily had even made the vegetables taste delectable so for the first time in our lives padfoot and i finished our veggies my dad was so proud we went to mass at about 10 and enjoyed the service very much wizard priests have a better way with words and no we dontworship the devil i hate voldmort come on now hehe but yeah contrary to popular belief like all societies and countries the community of wizards and witches have a wealth of religions we happen to be catholics one of the deacons at the catholic cathedral decided it would be cool if he used cymbals with the christmas hymns this of course made sirius and i snigger and the sleepiness that had been threatening us all night disappeared with the distraction of making fun of the guy i bet you this guy was a slytherin sirius said from under his hand as the deacon pounded another out of tune and out of beat note from the misshapen cymbals i let out a snort quickly turning it into a cough before it became a laugh how do you know he likes torturing people number one sign in slytherins he pointed out actually my dad zach interrupted we went to school together and he was huffelpuff that made even remus snort and we got glares from not only our girls but the four old ladies sitting in front of us i falling asleep here man remus grumbled after an hour i gestured to sirius at least you have self control i whispered sirius had his chin on his chest and his eyes closed breathing deeply and sleeping deeply as well he got a swift thrust to his side from piper when we got home sirius and i sat down on our asses with harry in front of christmas tree more eager then four year olds to open our presents what d you buy me what d you buy me sirius kept asking as i restrained harry from attack an ornament on a tree i picked up a neatly wrapped package harry picked out i nodded as he ripped apart the wrapping paper what the fuck watch your language my dad said promptly what is it piper asked curiously sitting on her knees behind her fianc i grinned chew toy i smiled holding up the cat shaped thing most of the gifts toys and cute little outfits for the newest addition of our family we had gotten each other the most sincerest of gifts and the funniest gifts like sirius chew toy and a nuzzle for remus making him growl and proving our point all is fair and love and christmas presents we laughed so much bursting seemed like an option we laughed for no reason sometimes just remembered something from the past few hours and cracked up even my dad we laughed and talked so much till we had tears in our eyes and our voices hoarse harry fell asleep in kat arms and she refused to set him down christmas was always my favorite holiday because all of us got together and just goofed off i cantwait for christmas now and hopefully some day soon harry will be able to share a christmas similar to his first one with us i going to canada in a week or so so dontexpect any updates on this i gonna start working on the vicious cycle and these ll be last updates for this year merry christmas and happy new year to all thank you for reading and you guys all rock and i love and appreciate each and every one of you please dontbe pissed at me if the updates are late no time rock on ch 20 they know you re enemies i was sitting at breakfast alone a few days later nina was at pre school and piper and sirius were spending some quality time together yeah we dontwanna know i was sipping my coffee and reading about the newest gang bust in turlock when lily walked in she was wearing a black suite with a knee height skirt showing off her legs her beautiful hair up in a bun she looked like a business woman first class morning sweetheart she smiled brightly i didntsee the smile too caught up in staring at her legs counting the times they ve been twined around my waist morning i said distractedly oh dear is it going to be just my husband eyeing me like that or all the guys at work too she asked hands at her waist tapping a foot irritably i should change my head snapped up and a sheepish smile if anyone stares at you like i do just slap them then tell me so i can curse them very subtle james she smiled and bent down to kiss me i turned around on the stool spread my thighs and she immediately pressed closer to me mouth to mouth breath for breath heart for heart i ignored the flutter of wings and cursed when something hit my head it was the delivery owl for the prophet second time this week that bloody birds thrown the damn thing at my head i said rubbing my head with one hand while the other was still around her back she was laughing of course that bloody bird has got something against me right darling a delivery owl trying to kill you lily laughed her arms around my neck still maybe it working for voldemort i said narrowing my eyes for good measure as i watched it fly out of the kitchen window lily laughed and you were calling mad eye paranoid she teased opening the paper with a snap in front of my chest knowing there was no chance in hell i would let her go hey remember bertha jorkins from the ministry she was in hogwarts with us a few years older and she always tried to get sirius yeah what about her i asked both arms sliding around her waist now she gone missing in albania lily told me albania i repeated frowning she was apparently on a vacation she answered something didntfit how can you just disappear off the face of the earth a frown made it way onto lily face hey wasntthere a rumor a few years ago that voldemort was hiding in albania you think she ran into him i asked skeptical lily shrugged knowing her yeah i sighed bertha had been one of those girls at school who had to know who was going out with who who was sleeping with who and who was breaking up with who she was also absolutely daft not a good combination hey the goblet due to pick out the three champions today she exclaimed i have a personal invitation from dumbledore to attend the ceremony i smiled gently taking the newspaper from her hand and setting it aside say hello to my son for me she said good humouredly always i smiled before kissing her do you really think that owl was from voldemort she asked with a smile more than likely i laughed kissing her chin and moving down fast idiot she said lovingly c mon now get off me i need to go to work why dontyou stay home i asked nuzzling behind her ear inhaling her perfume and the scent only my lily has we have enough gold to last us two lifetimes i know but the american government may get suspicious as to how we re getting our money she whispered her head falling back as my tongue pretended her neck was an ice cream cone except a little more delicious she tried to pull away but i pulled her back and i have massive arms so moving was purely impossible in my arms dontgo i whispered james you re acting like a baby again she told me oh well i smiled and was about to attack her lips but she forcefully pulled back i ll see you tonight she grinned i blew out a frustrated breath but smiled i ll be the one with the red rose in my mouth laughing she tenderly kissed my cheek and left for work leaving me alone in the house i looked around the kitchen and decided that there was nothing to do except go get lost in a photo album or a book for the next few hours lily had been home for only a little while when i had to leave for hogwarts so i could watch the ceremony and i secretly just wanted go to make sure nothing went awry since i still paranoid i apologized to nina for not being able to play with her and explained that harry might need me she seemed oddly content with that and my wife didntneed an explanation or anything and just told me to get home fast so i could tell her what happened and what harry looked like and every expression that crossed his face i flood into dumbledore office and had a few hundred heart attacks when i saw half the hogwarts staff including mad eye and the two headmaster from the foreign schools standing in dumbledore office including barty crouch bastard and ludo bagman moron apparently i was a tiny bit too early hello i said stepping out of the fireplace and dusting off some of the soot left on my jeans and t shirt i d been smart enough to put on black wizarding robes and though they didnthave any insignia on them they looked exactly like the ones the auror wore ah mr parker dumbledore exclaimed coming forward with a greeting on his face how wonderful that you accepted my invitation i shook his hand and pasted on the same sort of smile of course dumbledore wouldntmiss this for the world everyone i would like you to met a dear friend of mine dumbledore said to the company this is cian parker he announced cian wasntthat a celtic warrior or something he is one of my very trusted friends and one of the best wizards i ve ever seen are you an auror mad eye barked no i said quite startled thinking he could tell who i really was with that eye we were in school together dumbledore said enthusiastically he the head of the dmle in america and that where i noticed it i didnthave blue black hair and i didnthave the physique of a 34 year old man instead i had white hair that was half as long as dumbledores and had a white beard that was trimmed and i was wearing glasses when the hell had i turned into this and how and why was i an old man looking at dumbledore i knew being atticus would draw harry attention and being just me would get the rest of the worlds attention and would make them start asking questions so i would need to hide so he d come up with this ploy his dear old friend cian from school are you scottish mcgonagall asked curiously aye i nodded why now that wasnta lie i have some scottish highlander in my blood your name cian she said extending her hand i minerva mcgonagall she smiled smiting eew is she flirting with me nice to meet you i smiled my dear cian this is madam maxime of beauxbatons in france and this gentleman is igor karkaroff of durmstrang in belgium dumbledore said i nodded to karkaroff trying not to sneer but since i was supposedly the head of the department of magical law enforcement in america i should know a death eater right mr karkaroff i seem to have heard your names a few years ago caught in some controversy or am i thinking of another karkaroff i asked very dumbledore like in my charm and politeness unfortunately mr parker he said with a thick russian accent it was i but those were in my younger years i held back a snort the guy was born a few years before moses and ten years ago was young for him i was stupid and got mixed up in the wrong things i have devoted my life to my students and my school now how very noble i nearly sneered but managed to smile congenially enough to turn to madam maxime the gentle giantess and kissed her large hand regally come now everyone dumbledore said spreading his arm minerva please lead everyone to the great hall i sure the students have started filling up already i would if you dontmind cian a privet word with you sure i nodded wondering if that was too young a response for dumbledore close friend they didntsuspect so i think it was a good enough response they all turned obediently to follow mcgonagall to the great hall for the special feast then the drawing of the three contestants when the door shut behind severus snap i narrowed my eyes as dumbledore began chuckling you will make a very handsome old gentleman one day james he smiled i ran a hand through my snow white hair let just hope it doesnthappen as quickly as this how did you change me anyway i asked curiously i put the spell on the fireplace so that whenever you flood you would be immediately turned into an erm well you d be my age he finished i laughed not ready to admit your old yet eh i smiled mockingly everyone old james he said mysteriously right i said slowly so what the plan there is no plan he shrugged i merely wanted you to have a fine view of the drawing tonight in case anything goes awry i cocked an eyebrow you couldntjust leave me as a young strapping auror who the ministry assigned to keep an eye on things mad eye would ve known and certainly minerva since they wouldntrecognize you because half the people your age in the british isles has been to hogwarts and been taught by minerva and mad eye being the former head auror would certainly know his own aurors that makes sense i shrugged and what was that little comment about things going awry i didntsay they would just a mere precaution i am a cautious man james he said with that damned twinkle in those impossibly blue eyes hidden behind those half moons seriously this guy could pass for a santa claus with that jolly spirit all he lacks is the stomach the jolly old fellow is supposed to have but he said dear god here it comes i sighed leaning back against his desk and folding my arms across my chest do you remember what the draghar and tuathe de dannan are james he asked i dontremember what the tuathe de are but i remember the draghar arentthey like the evil part of the celtic druids i asked they turned evil because they felt abused by the gods or something the gods are the legendary fae the tuathe de dumbledore told me i nodded i knew the stories about the fae and all those myths and legends surrounding the celts and the beginning of ireland my grandfather was born in the highlands of scotland so i would sit on his lap as a kid and he told me about the fae and draghar sect apparently the first people to set foot on the soil of ireland were the tuathe de dannan a civilization more advanced then any and their queen was aoibheal with a court full of the most powerful fae they became friends with the humans on the land the mere mortals who were apparently druids then one day a rebellion rose led by 13 druids who wished to poses the powers of the fae and the rebellion became a bloody battle when the 13 turned evil the 13 12 men and 1 woman are the most dangerous creatures on earth with horrendous power almost equal to voldemort powers they are known as the draghar and no one knows where they are what about them i asked or is this just a history lesson i have a friend in scotland a friend whom i ve actually grown up with and he a druid his family dates back to the times of the tuathe de and he has sent word to me that there have been rumors circling scotia that somehow the draghar have been released from the prison the queen sent them to and have joined powers with voldemort dumbledore informed fourteen evil sorcerers what the hell is it a party or something and can you imagine the destruction and horror the world will be in if god forbid they get together how can we find out for sure and how does one release the draghar by traveling through time and realms one can release the 13 souls dumbledore told me his eye studying me curiously peter i asked quietly of course peter who else but peter the reward for him if he restores voldemort is endless of course peter who else that my suspicion he nodded i blew out a breath what do we do he began to pace in front of me if let say the draghar are released and agree to help voldemort wreak havoc on the world there is no way to stop the draghar you see the souls themselves cannot be released they will never take human form again but they will possess another body and use it as a vessel like what voldy did to quirrell i asked horror dawning hell was so close and i was trying to find any way i could to somehow stop it stop the hell from effecting my family in any way yes almost exactly that but the souls take over the entire body and brain no sign of who the person was before will be left dumbledore informed is there a way to to vanquish them only aoibheal has the power dumbledore answered he looked at his watch i just wanted to inform you of this as a precaution as i pointed it out you never know in this world james a rumor may just turn out to be the unadulterated truth i snorted that life for you ya he chuckled and nodded let us join everyone else in the great hall i sure you want to see how much your son resembles you smiling i let him lead me to the great hall through a few entrances i knew but i shouldntknow because i was only a student at hogwarts the place was packed with kids even more so than usual given the students from the other two schools karkaroff boys looked exactly like what i expected massive and mean looking lads and maxime girls were delicate and perfect french girls they had all eaten and i was looking around scanning the familiar griffyndor table to find my son and his friends and i did and yet again i began marveling at how much he looked like me and how much those eyes looked like his mothers he was busily chatting with ron and hermoine familiar to me now as his version of remus and sirius while staring dreamily towards the ravenclaw table i wonder who the girl is dumbledore speech was a series of buzzes in my mind because i was too busy scanning the hall gaze lingering on the suspicious ones and of course i stared a great deal at snape and karkaroff but my eyes also lingered on mad eye he was shorter than i remembered older too i guess and less hair i wondered if he was still on that constant vigilance thing if he was then harry couldntbe in safer hands i ve known mad eye for almost all my life he was in school with my dad and they were pretty good friends he used to pop by now and then they were also partners back in the day and he trained me i proudly wore a t shirt sometimes displaying the motto mad eye aurors sirius and i always took full pride of that as did everyone else hence the shirts we made he taught me that paranoia wasntsuch a bad thing after all and caution always led to safety and capture of a few death eaters he was such a great teacher he was blunt never sugar coated things and always told you if you would die or not during a duel with a death eater and he had fallen from grace now my hero and mentor of so many years how proud he would ve been of me and sirius if he knew what we were up to now and escape from voldemort and one from azkaban the flames of the goblet suddenly turned red and the hall fell silent and i had only eyes for harry who looked startled by the fire abrupt change the first champion was victor krum from durmstrang the second fleur delacor a scrumptious perfect blonde for beauxbatons and cedric diggory for the hogwarts champion they all looked at the goblet again and to my great surprise and alarm the flames had gone red again and a piece of paper flew out i will never forget the expression on dumbledore face he was enraged surprised alarmed and worried all at the same time as he stared at the piece of parchment his head suddenly snapped up and he stared at me harry potter he yelled viciously the great hall could ve been mistaken for catacombs it became so silent but i could hear my heart beating in my ears feel the fist in my stomach as the second replayed over and over again dumbledore had called out harry name my son name from the goblet of fire the irreversible fate of the champion depended on the goblet spitting out their name my son fate in this case i felt myself growing red wanting to walk towards harry grab his collar and demand how the hell he managed to go through the age line dumbledore had set but one look at him and a rational moment later i realized harry would rather be doing anything else except the championship harry dumbledore yelled when harry sat there like a deer in headlights more than likely doubting the fact that his name had been called out come up here if you please cian he yelled first time in my life which is almost as long as i ve known dumbledore he looked unbelievably mad both harry and i marched towards dumbledore and i couldnttake my eyes off his startled face the way his eyes were out to jump out of their sockets i didntput my name in the goblet professor he said the minute he reached dumbledore the headmaster didntreply but inclined his head towards the door the other three champions had gone through the hell is going on here i asked as the two of us followed harry to the door behind the teachers tables in the great hall i dontknow dumbledore answered brusquely than stopped and turned to look at me do you think he put his name in the goblet i balked but answered anyway if i know my son and i do i think he was a bit thankful that there was an age limit to entering the contest the way he acts he hates the attention he gets he didntput his name in then who did dumbledore asked rubbing his chin whoever it is he isnta friend there are enemies inside the walls i said and was about to kill everyone in the castle save harry and dumbledore at last lol i just got back from my trip a few days ago so you mustntblame me for anything like updating late i hope you liked the chapter and had awonderful new years and christmas god knowsi did lol and you can make it brighter by recommending this to your friends and reviewing more often thank you love you mav ch 21 you re still you am i still me sirius blew up piper bit her nails remus thoughtfully frowned and rubbed his chin lily eyes began to mist and nina wanted to know if her brother was ok and i wanted to blow someone brains out preferably mine it was the day after i found out and then the family found out about harry i was lying on my back on our massive bed one arm behind my head the other around lily waist as she cried silently into my chest she been so upset and worried about harry that i dontknow what to say or do to make her stop crying i cantassure her that he ll be ok that he ll hold his own because he in 4th year and there no parent or anything that can teach him how to fight if i d been there if i was still considered alive i wonder what would ve happened what his name have still popped out of the goblet he ll be ok wonthe james lily whispered she had finally stopped i could tell from the hoarseness in her voice and i was taken back to the night we were separated from him for the first time and she begged asked me to tell her that everything would be ok that we d all survive and the end of hell was near well that didntexactly happen now did it separation i guess is only the beginning i cantpromise you anything that no for me to promise sweets and you know that i whispered to her staring at the ceiling of our room bathed in the white blue moonlight she moaned and buried her face deeper into my chest increasing my grip on her was my only response since nothing else could comfort her i knew what she was feeling i felt the same things perhaps ten times worse or maybe not i dontknow but the horror at the idea of our precious son already in danger being in more jeopardy because of the stupid tournament harry grew up in a muggle world if he like me had seen his parents perform magic watched as his father demonstrated spells aurors used we might not have been so worried i could ve sent letters to him with spells and their instructions i couldntdo it as atticus because well it illegal only a parent can send in a letter that contains such information and though dumbledore would allow my letter to go through harry and his friends surely had to know the rules and sirius was on the run so i blew out a frustrated breath my chest expanding her head rising with my sigh maybe dumbledore could let him go karkaroff was willing he d nearly ripped harry head off in the backroom after his name was called and maxime wasnttoo thrilled at the prospect of two hogwarts champions but the two ministry members wouldntallow it they insisted harry had to compete poor kid stupid crouch i never liked him he not only put sirius in azkaban but gave us the aurors hell during the first war james lily whispered rising on her elbow to look down on me mm i asked my hand stroking her cheek tracing her lower low lip wanting it to stop quivering do you think one of voldemort people put his name in she asked quietly her eyes scanning my face lingering on my eyes and on my lips considering every strange thing that happened so far i cantsay i haventthought about the possibility i told her kissing her cheek smiling when she kissed my thumb as it skimmed over her lips what if he comes back voldemort she asked a terrified expression crossing her face her breaths becoming increasingly shallow her trademark for when she frightened and i was powerless a might less and sword less knight unable to rescue his princess helpless defenseless blind then we fight side by side and die if need be for our son and daughter or in my case you as well i rose to put my lips on hers for good measure we ll stick together like the first war stronger perhaps because have more to protect you really think he back lily asked as i stayed up on my elbows it inevitable i said softly against her lower lip dontworry what the hell dontworry i about to pull out my hair with worry and i tell her not to well maybe i doing enough worrying for both of us maybe i can save her the head splitting headache but the prophecy she whispered putting her head back on my chest so i lay back down during the 2nd war it supposed to be fulfilled right i dontknow i answered painfully helpless to protect her harry and nina and since nina is our daughter she in as much danger as harry is how the fk is a man supposed to feel when his arms and legs are cut off and his families in danger god if only i had some power some way to shield them from the inevitable hell i d be willing to do anything anything to keep them safe keep those tears out of my wife soulful eyes sleep on it lily it ll be a lighter day tomorrow she nestled closer to me her hands on my chest and she intertwined her legs with mine lily fell asleep and i watched her and it takes a lot to make a man stare at his perfect wife and cry harry contacted sirius through mail and told him about what had happened sirius wrote him telling him to write anything suspicious that happened at the school harry was worried and we could tell so now a week before the first task which were dragons courtesy of dumbledore sirius was getting ready to floo him everyone upstairs and turn off all the lights i told piper nina and lily sirius was already on his knees in front of the fireplace on the cushions we d set out for him i would stand beside the fireplace just in case and listen to the conversation sirius would tell him he d broken into a wizard house and he needed to hurry for good measure but of course he wouldnthurry unless someone from harry side intervened the conversation started as we d planned harry spilled his guts out to his godfather telling him about the tournament the articles the bitch rita skeeter was writing about him great works of fiction and ron not believing that he hadntput his name in the goblet he ended the confession with hagrid just showed me the first task and it dragons sirius i a goner he said sounding as helpless as i felt sirius warned him about karkaroff and told him the history of the former death eater he put special emphasis on the fact that he couldntbe trusted and someone was out to get him and harry seemed to understand that perfectly well just as they were getting ready to hint him on what to do for the first task harry hissed at sirius to go someone coming go was the last thing harry said before sirius pulled out be careful harry there are enemies within the walls was sirius last massage to the boy he backed out and sat on his ass this doesntfeel right i sighed flopping down on the couch behind him in the study the same odd feeling when the first war started sirius sighed foreboding i confirmed rubbing my temples maybe we re just paranoid sirius shrugged i blew a raspberry he chuckled mirthlessly peter probably run and gotten him out of wherever the hell voldemort was probably taking care of him right now as we speak more than likely i nodded what are we gonna do we cantjust sit on our ass and wait he said i shrugged nothing else we can do and i want to scream at having to admit that that i have no power at all we ll be pulling out our hair in the near future ha sirius asked running a hand through his hair he was worried too the haunted look in his eyes that piper had chased away returned i ve already started i nodded clenching my jaw wanting to punch something but we ll manage somehow this is one of those situations where we close our eyes and run into battle blind eh he asked standing up and walking towards me he flopped down on the couch beside me yep with nothing but determination for a weapon and shield i closed my eyes vivid images from the first war rushing to me hitting me full force god help us all i remember our first full blown battle with the death eaters it had been a couple of weeks after lily and i had gotten back from our honeymoon i d been called up by moody at 1 in the morning strange what time emergencies decide to happen i had stumbled to the auror hq where moody briefly briefed us and nearly beat up sirius and i because we were nodding off when we arrived at cardiff order members were already there trying to duke it out alone against the stupid death eaters we d lost several people that night and sirius had admitted to tearing his shorts he d gotten so frightened when piper had gotten grazed on the shoulder with a curse a death eater had sent lily had been there as well to my distaste seeing as how she was an order member she was frightened after that spent a few hours in my lap later that night trembling with fear and whatever else she was entitled to feel in my arms and i remember pretending that it was she who needed to be held that i was strong and didntneed her to hold me to make me feel human again after what i d just witnessed the people albeit death eaters i d killed the death eaters had butchered about 20 muggles making remus theory about the parallels between the nazi and death eaters true except voldemort was a thousand time worse then ol hitler we lost 10 order members that awful night and 16 aurors and a handful of death eaters had been captured anyone else that came out alive out of that battle was in shock and was bloodied and bruised and spent a few hours at st mungos but since lily was in the order the marauders came to our house to be healed sirius piper and i had gone to the house later then the others having to go to the ministry to report to moody when we got home remus was sitting on the stool in the kitchen with lily standing in front of him lightly dabbing at a deep cut above his right eye with a cotton ball she preferred to do things the muggle healer way when the cut was too close to somewhere vital you could tell by remus expression that there was alcohol on the cotton ball peter was sitting at the other end of the counter holding an ice pack to his head and kat was holding a cloth to her arm blood had made a big red dot on there and i was about to scream my head off hating to see my friends in such a condition especially my wife who had a very deep cut on her shoulder that caused her trouble for quite a long time james you ok she had asked putting remus hand on the cotton ball and brusquely coming towards me and holding my face in her hands as she examined me i fine i d assured her trying to blink away the fear from eyes we d fought side by side of course well back to back i d cussed out a few death eaters who d dare send the killing curse at her you sure she asked feeling my face with her fingertips to make sure i was there in one piece i grabbed her wrists and stared directly into her green eyes i fine love i said just got a bruised knee and might ve twisted my ankle but i fine i promise she had nodded and gone to examine piper and sirius sending me glances now and then as i sat by kat my head on her shoulder as we discussed what had happened was snape fighting on our side or theirs theirs lily answered who do you think cut my shoulder your shitting me i said my head to heavy to lift from kat shoulder lily shook her head and made sirius yelp by applying something to his cut i recognized him by his voice he said a spell i never heard of sectusempra right kat asked quietly something like that yeah she nodded that son of a bitch i muttered seeing blood and a bigo bulls eye right in the middle of snape forehead what does the curse do lily asked looking at the three auror with curiosity in those eyes remember 5th year after the exams when you yelled and james and i for picking on snivellus sirius asked she nodded not a pleasant memory or moment in our relationship she had yelled at me and called me arrogant and made me realize the error of my ways a year later we were the hottest couple in hogwarts and remember when there was a huge gash on james cheek when snape got to his wand piper asked lily lily nodded same spell lils i smiled sadly tracing the scar on my cheek is that what that from she asked surprised i nodded that little son of a bitch she muttered making me chuckle that means he knew dark magic since he was a kid i think snape first words was a dark curse piper muttered darkly the mystery of snape keeps getting more mysterious lily said sitting down on the stool having finished healing every one and i seriously dontwant to solve it kat said pointing at lily with her bear bottle a few minutes of silence passed and were broken by sirius peter man you still alive huh yeah why peter asked jumping a bit nothing you just haventsaid anything for a few hours got a bit worried mate sirius said slapping him on the back as he passed him by on his way to the fridge oy mate get your head off my girls shoulder remus said making kat laugh as he dragged a stool and sat next to her putting his head on her shoulder i miss that redheaded blue eyed beauty she and i had the same birthday and our parents had known each other from the hospital when we were born she was older than me by a few minutes and she always thanked me for introducing her to remus kat was the greatest most gentle friend you talked to her and you felt like the most special person on earth and you left your conversation with her with a smile on your lips and loved yourself i ve expressed my regrets for not trying hard enough to stop her from joining voldemort ranks but she pressed and had made up her mind and died at the hands of her friend for the sake of us all a martyr you could say fine jealous jackass i said and put my head on lily shoulder just know that i ve known that girl since before you could even pronounce the word kat come on now kids let not fight i love you both very much she assured us patting our heads like we were puppies just on different levels that it kat i want a divorce i said slamming my fist on the counter oy forgetting about lily lily asked smacking my head i turned my head on her shoulder and looked at her kissing her soft cheek i murmured course not i love you best i love you more than i love sirius and that saying something piper laughed oh psh fine just leave sirius out like yesterday trash he said pouting oh come on padfoot you know i love more than i love remus i said and it continued we moved from remus to piper and from piper to peter then to mcgonagall damn i miss those simple days lily sirius and i were snuck into the castle by dumbledore himself for the first task piper and nina were sitting in the stands no one would really notice them unless they looked closely at nina but i think the vicious dragons out there would divert everyone attention and we had made sure nina understood that things would get a bit scary she said she understood and wanted to go anyway so we let her provided that whenever she got too scared piper would send a massage through lily wand the two would return home with nina sirius would remain in his dog form next to the couple atticus evans and his newest girlfriend delilah jones we would sit in the stands as a couple with their dog and watch the match and hope that harry had figured out that sirius had been trying to tell him to use his flying to pass the dragon the first few champions went harry was apparently last amos diggory son an ass i knew from my days in the ministry cedric transfigured a rock into a dog to distract him smart idea but kind of dumb too and it offended sirius a bit the beauxbatons champion put the damn thing into a trance worked for a while then major disastero and the durmstrang champion who turned out to be a world famous seeker blinded the dragon except the creature went psycho and nearly crushed the dude then harry potter was announced and lily painfully gripped my knee in anticipation and nina who was sitting behind me started clapping and calling out her brother name i caught dumbledore sneaking a glance at her and smiling out of all the champions and i say this as an objective spectator harry technique had to be the best and most dangerous he flew i dontknow how much lily and i cursed and how many heart attacks we had as our son tried to get the damned egg but he did and did it in one piece and lily was so happy she started crying i decided to pay the champion a personal tribute and sent the little group home and went to the champions tent atticus he exclaimed and ran to me from his group of friends hey harry i smiled were you watching the task he asked excitedly yeah wonderful job best out of all the other idiots i smiled clapping him on the shoulder not failing to notice his arm was in a sling from where he d gotten cut is that a compliment he asked with a smile i laughed and nodded damn good flyer i nodded mentally adding that he flew like his father me thanks he said a bit shyly i thought i told you to stay out of trouble or i d be forced to kick your ass i said narrowing my eyes well this isntexactly my idea harry said and explained to me everything i already knew about the goblet choosing him be careful harry i told him be as paranoid as you can it ll keep you alive he nodded staring at his shoes and promise to write me when you need anything deal deal he smiled you haventnoticed have you he smiled slyly noticed what i asked frowning i wearing your sweatshirt he smiled i laughed and recognized the sweatshirt i d given him long ago it was still a bit too big for the scrawny teenager but it fit him a bit better thanks atticus he said and hugged me knocking out all my breath from shock when i recovered i put my arms around him and planted a kiss in his unruly hair you re very welcome for whatever he chuckled as i pulled back i have to get going you do too wontdo for you stay out here i squeezed his shoulder be careful mentally i added son an i busted my ass trying to get this typed just ask my editor amber how fast i d typped this chapter to get it up lol i hope you guys liked it review or i die lol seriously it a curse on me if someone reads this story and doesntreview ten years are taken off my life lol love you all rock on mav ch 23 now bring me that horizon harry may as well have fainted the moment he recognized me because he didntsay one word as i practically dragged him to the castle thanking and cursing dumbledore for having called my name and cursing myself more because i d responded but when you ve been called by one name for nearly 36 years you have a tendency of being responsive to that name this cantbe real he finally whispered as i walked him up the steps to dumbledore office where he d instructed me to take him voldemort must ve done something to my head nope this is very real harry i really am dragging you up the stairs i smiled his arm was around my waist because he couldntwalk upright without help too weak to do so he d been a little afraid of me down at the maze refusing to touch me or say anything to me cantblame him really but you re dead my dad dead he said quietly still staring at me it looked like he was trying to memorize my face he was one step away from running his fingers over my face like a blind man to make sure it was me i d prayed for this moment of recognition where we could be father and son and it wasntjust a secret i only knew but now that this beautiful moment was here i didntknow what to say and worried about his reaction at finding out we d kept such a huge secret from him and for some reason i regretted the moment he found out he had a little sister would he blow up at lily and i and anyone who d known we were alive or would he just listen to the facts except them make his peace with it and let it all go knowing him and knowing his father me the outcome was unpredictable long story harry trust me i murmured as i thrust open the door to dumbledore massive curiosity inspiring office how do i know you re not a death eater the one that been at hogwarts all along i mean how the hell can you be atticus one minute and my dead father the next he asked as i set him on the winged visitors chair how do i know you haventbeen spying on me since i was 5 to sell me out to voldemort how do i know you didntkill the real atticus evens and took his place and disguised yourself as my father i smiled at his response cautious curious and very logical just like his parents and where he got his energy after all he d been through only god know the source of energy possibly from my dad side my dad himself always hit the ground running how do you know i not james potter evil twin jason i smiled kneeling in front of him for a closer look at his bumps and bruises nothing looked fatal but one look at the way he carefully sat down told me he d been under the craciatus i looked him square in the eyes his mother s it a long story and only guessing about what you ve been through tonight i canttell you everything right now just the fact that it really is me james potter your dad i gave him a small smile and cupped his cheek in my hand you have to believe me harry he studied for a few minutes sirius know who do you think busted him out of azkaban i winked were you at the lake the night wormtail escaped he asked i nodded in answer his cheek still in my hand yeah tears pooled his eyes you ve been alive all along yeah was all i managed to say and kickin myself for not being with you for not being able raise watch you in the open growing into a young man this cantbe true he murmured and i could see he resigned and accepted the fact that it really was me i must be hallucinating have you eaten anything sirius has given you in the last few days i asked soberly confused he shook his head no then no you re not hallucinating i smiled he chuckled through tears and emotions i was feeling as well this is too good to be true he murmured but how i told you if i explain it now alone it ll give you headache and your mother will have my ass in a sling if i explain everything without her i said casually as though we werentstrangers mom he whispered oh god i know i nodded and as he wrapped himself in my arms dad i cantbelieve this he said into my shoulder as i stroked his unruly hair cautious of the bump on his head wow i heard a breathy voice say behind me recognizing it too well to be sirius s for some reason harry arms wrapped tighter around me and i let him squeezing back in turn and kissing whatever part of his face i could get my boy my boy knew it was me he knew it was james potter and not some stranger who d befriended him he called me dad he hugged me like a son would hug his father after an ordeal no one should have to go through it so good to have you back harry i whispered to him tears streaming down my face this should ve happened a long time ago his first year maybe before we should ve never been separated i should ve fought to the death to keep him with me to have my shoulder available whenever life became too much for my one and only son i should ve fought harder tried harder that night maybe even attempted a killing curse anything would ve been better then succumbing to lily pleas to accept the bargain with voldemort this cantbe right dad he said i must have fainted or something you re dead you ve been dead for 13 years i pulled back putting my forehead on his and smiled at him squeezing the back of his neck yeah but you just called me dad and your bruises still hurt dontthey this is happening isntit he laughed a little i have a family again you ve always had us we just haventcrossed paths i smiled and kissed his forehead again about to start jumping up and down in glee i felt sirius walk towards us saw harry look up at him and smile you should ve told me he said softly sirius laughed he would ve kicked my arse from america to antarctica he answered you ve been in america all this time harry asked me yeah i promise we ll explain everything later but first you have to tell us what happened so we can start on damage control i said i was still knelt next to his chair sirius on his other side with a hand on his godsons shoulder as harry quietly recalled everything that had happened how the cup had been a portkey how he and cedric had tied and gone for the cup together how they d been transported to a cemetery how cedric had been killed i nearly snapped his arm in half when he told me that wormtail and cut his arm to get blood for the perverse ritual of bringing back the devil harry told us how voldemort had touched him without being burned like he had previously he told us that he and voldemort had dueled and suddenly he stopped the wands wouldntfight i cantdescribe it he said quietly staring at his shoes seemingly unaware of the father he d just gotten back from the dead he tried the killing curse but this i dontknow beam of light like connected the wands and people came out i frowned at dumbledore who was studying harry intensely cedric came out an old man showed up he looked like a muggle then a woman bertha jorkins i guess i dontknow he shrugged then lily showed up then i did i breathed sitting on my ass with the impact of the facts harry looked down at me yeah you told me to let go when you told me and make a break for the cup tears and regret fogged his eyes and cedric asked me to bring out his body were these images corporeal harry dumbledore asked quietly he shook his head it was like a hologram i i cantdescribe it at that moment the door burst open and mad eye moody came in james potter alive and well i see i looked at dumbledore instead of reacting sirius had changed into a dog the second the door opened you took the charm off there is no use for it voldemort is back he shrugged ah i said and stood up to face the auror yep i back mad eye he growled can i see you outside that didntsound right something in my gut just didntlike that idea and that same thing had me reach into my pocket something was off about him i cantexplain it really i ll be right back i murmured as i walked out of the study i had barely shut the door when mad eye rammed into me his arm against my throat knocking my head against the door hard shit i grumbled welcoming the fight since i hadntreally had any action for 13 years i felt blood trickle down my nose immediately but ignored it and fought back using all my strength i pushed away from the door and rammed against the wall you think you can escape the dark lord wrath he hissed chuckling as i pressed my arm against his throat this wasntmad eye and slowly i could see the spots of long hair slowly being pulled back into the skull the normal eye turning color from icy blue to a darker color and the other eye popped out barty crouch jr was standing right in front of me dad i heard harry exclaim behind me you think you can defeat him fools he said right before i stunned him what the hell sirius murmured standing next to me as i let his body sag to the floor polly juice i said wiping my nose with the back of my hand he probably the one who put harry name in the goblet and turned the cup into a portkey i turned to look at dumbledore staring at barty crouch where the really mad eye i think i know he said you two better escort harry to the hospital wing i have sent remus to get lily i smiled at the stunned expression on harry face fine then i put my arm around his shoulder and escorted him to the hospital wing he was quiet as pomfrey worked on him and everyone stared at sirius and me like we were martians from another galaxy molly weasley and her children surrounded the bed staring at me with disbelief and so was hermione granger i made no move to explain anything to them accepting the cloth pomfrey offered my nose i could taste blood in the back of my neck remus walked in through the doors as harry wounds were all taken care of with me watching the entire process like a watch hound the gash on his arm had been cleaned for any germs or anything nasty like that where lily i asked spitting blood into the cup of water i had received i felt everyone stiffen at the name the idea that another dead person was about to come back to life in front of their eyes she coming up mcgonagall busy hugging the stuffing out of her piper and nina with her sirius asked he was sitting beside me on the bed ignoring the stares he received from molly even after ron explained to her everything that had happened with him remus shook his head lils didntwant nina coming in just yet he said cautiously you knew about this too harry asked with a hint of betrayal in his voice i found out the night wormtail escaped remus explained prongs kept me company throughout the full moon i heard the door open and saw lily standing in the doorway her eyes already flooded in tears her lip quivering despite her clean jeans nice shirt and overcoat she looked disheveled like she hadntslept in a year or two i got up from the bed to meet her there knowing she would faint sooner rather then later she waited for today longer then i take a deep breath i murmured to her she blinked up at me what happened to you she asked frowning choosing to ignore the onslaught of emotions for the moment long story i answered you ready to face him no i thought i was but no she shook her head looking at harry over my shoulder he calm enough about it hasntpunched me or had a fit yet so we re safe i smiled idiot she said pushing me aside i stood at the door and watched her slowly walk towards his bed saw her hand move to cover her mouth her shoulders shake from tears and laughter i heard her murmur his name before she took her baby boy in her arms kissing every inch of his face stroking his hair his back touching him to make sure he was calling her mom making sure he knew who she was that she was the woman who had carried him for nine months who had changed all those diapers and loved him more than anything on earth my son hadntknown the love of a mother he d had inkling about the love of a father but never a mother and seeing him cry against her shoulder probably seeing cedric death in his minds eye while also regretting like us all the lost times i slowly walked towards them the blood had stopped and i needed to be a part of that moment that joy at having your family back after a lifetime of pain and betrayal and loneliness welcome to your new life harry remus said should be interesting he said as lily moved to sit behind him he lay back and put his head on his mothers shoulder no questions asked no suspicions no holding back the need for the love of his mother he leaned on her learned to love her and need her immediately like some part of her that part of that had shared her anatomy at some point pulled him and told him she was the one the one that cared for him brought him to this world told you he wontthrow a punch at you sirius grinned then who did lily asked me with a raised eyebrow absently kissing the side of her son head like if she didnttouch him for a second he would disappear again looong story i answered but the assailant has been given to the proper authorities what happened to the really moody harry asked me i nodded towards the bed where the real moody was lying down he ll be fine just got clunked over the head way too many times will someone care to explain why there is a wanted murderer and two people we presumed dead sitting here molly asked frustration ebbed in her voice time to tell all lils i smiled sitting beside them on the bed with minimal if not no interruption at all lily sirius and i explained everything had happened harry stared at one point at the end of his bed the entire time tears brimming his eyes again as i told him how i d turned into atticus how the cat had been lily how we d kept an eye on him subtle ways oh my god they all murmured once the story was finished i have a sister harry blinked his throat dry making his voice raspy yeah lily said quietly she should be along soon she was very excited when i told her she would meet you you should ve told me someone should ve told me harry murmured i should ve known it was for the best harry i told him if you knew you still would ve had to live separate from us and who knows if we werentunder cover i highly doubt we d be in one piece right now this is too good to be true he rubbed his face roughly with his hands the suddenly grinned do i get to live with you now it would make sense i smiled tapping his leg we can protect you better now he smiled at the prospect of being home at last i admit his reaction took me by surprise i ve seen him throw fits he has a temper that would rival mine and yet he accepted the facts and was content with them maybe the shock of the day had something to do with it dull everything making the need for family more important then answers to everything maybe he didntcare about anything so long as he had a family of his own now whatever made him lean his head against his mother shoulder whatever made him call me dad i was grateful for it dumbledore came in after a few minutes to check up adding a few more details to the story at molly insistence i surprised the woman didntfaint her eyes had become huge james bill said very casually i looked at the redhead and smiled yes good to have you back man he said with a nod good to be back i nodded dumbledore what the hell is going on here fudge barked walking through the door headmaster he gave those things permission to kiss crouch mcgonagall yelled i haventseen her this mad since sirius and i charmed all the statues to say something dirty to whoever passed by them oh crap i muttered as sirius quietly turned into a dog and jumped on harry bed and lay at his feet what would you have me do fudge asked let him go free we needed to question him cornelius dumbledore said calmly as i stood behind him ignoring the sneers snape sent my way regarding what we already know what he did to moody and he was an escapee from azkaban fudge yelled indignantly one eye on me he could ve given us answers told us how voldemort came back to power dumbledore said calmly what everyone murmured including lily whose gaze shot right to me with questions in her eyes that right and harry witnessed his rebirth dumbledore said lily could be seen tighten around her son that ridiculous albus fudge said with a scoff something telling me dumbledore had told him the story about lily and i being alive after a few minutes of arguing and fudge saying that harry was a lying little twerp and this was all ridiculous that voldemort was dead and could never come back he left what happens now sirius asked turning back into a human mcgonagall yelped in surprise but didntask questions just stared at padfoot we fight i answered right dumbledore nodded molly can i count on you and arthur of course you can she said still staring at lily and i like we were ghosts then i need a massage to be sent to arthur and everyone who believes the voldemort is back in power dumbledore said the order of the phoenix was back just like that bill volunteered to go tell his father while sirius went to got to dung and arbella to alert them of the situation he and remus were sent to alert the old crowd you can meet us at the house lily said dumbledore nodded and i gave the address to everyone who would meet us back at the house in america severus snape and sirius left the room at the same time snarling at each other alright sweetheart get some sleep lily murmured to harry are you leaving i ll be right here she smiled and gave him the dream less potion night he muttered drinking the stuff and fell asleep almost immediately i dontbelieve this ron said staring at me i ruffled his hair as i passed him by believe it kid i went out to the balcony of the hospital wing and stood there just watching the commotion on the grounds and wondered how odd it was one man had lost his son while i d gotten mine back how the world was turning dark with the return of voldemort and my life was lit up yet again he was with me again he knew i was alive the burden was lifted from my shoulders and the kid that had run rampant in these woods so long ago was back again we re a family again you as happy as i am sweetheart i heard lily ask from behind me she had snuck up on me and made me wonder how long i d been standing there probably i smiled turning around and wrapping her in my arms her hand on my heart keeping track of each beat that proclaimed she was my life one of the three reasons i was still alive and kicking he took that well she breathed putting her head against my shoulder better then i expected i agreed breathing in the familiar fragrance of my lily hair kissing it thankful she was happy and that speck of helplessness had disappeared from her beautiful eyes she pulled back and looked at me straight in the eyes as though she d known what i had been thinking and smiled a smile i had missed as much as being harry father i love you she said quietly i love you too i assured her before putting my lips on her breathing in life breathing in the promise of a brighter future in these dark times that were coming breathing in love and reassurance and her promise of love forever pulling back from the kiss i smiled at her this should be interesting indeed an review please love you alll mavvy ch 24 fickle pick of faith i was sitting with harry the next day my broken nose mended and my lip still bruised but other then that i was perfectly happy i felt complete for the first time in a long time all the old bitterness gone replaced by quiet contentment that at last we were together at last i could look at him and call him son you know harry i really proud with the way you ve handled all this i said after a period of silence i had sent lily down to talk to the reporters since they always pissed me off and i ended up saying something i shouldnthave she had a way of tap dancing around the truth with grace giving you no information and making it look like she was revealing every secret what do you mean he frowned you didntthrow a fit you listened to logic i smiled at him letting all the love i had for him shine in my eyes very impressive he beamed at me shadows of what had happened that night still haunted his emerald eyes he shrugged it was easy the story made sense because i kept having like these flashes or dreams or something i cantexplain but i kinda remember being in your lap with a house burning in the background i chuckled shaking my head in disbelief that he still remembered that night amazed at how much his brain could store and recall yeah that was the night voldemort attacked and we made the deal my arm was broken but you hung on to me and wouldntlet go hung on to me like a leach he smiled delighted at having been accurate and having his father relate stories and you used to call me emeralds right i laughed and nodded at that moment the hospital door opened and i was immediately on alert and got my wand only to put it back when i saw piper poke her head in she grinned as i waved her in and i saw nina hiding behind piper leg walking carefully and hiding at the same time i looked at harry to see him sitting like he d just been struck by a thunder bolt staring at the figure walking behind piper hello piper smiled stopping by the bed and looked at harry my you ve grown since i last saw you then again the last time i saw you was when you were barely two she frowned act normal for once piper dontscare the kid i smiled my eyes never leaving nina behind piper leg speaking of kids i laughed i looked at harry and mouthed call her silently he nodded and clearing his throat from whatever emotion that might intervene said very clearly nina she pressed closer to pipers leg nearly knocking the woman over nina let me see you harry said quietly c mon show him what a pretty smile you got baby i said and peered around and found her looking at me with a blush creeping up her cheeks she looked so shy it broke my heart and made it flutter at the same time she shook her head i cocked an eyebrow at her we were nose to nose now behind piper leg nervous she nodded but he your big brother i pointed out dontyou want to talk to him to kiss his booboos and tell him to feel better so he can teach you how to play quiddich she nodded i stood up having been on my haunches in front of her i held out my hand out for her c mon i said as she grabbed my hand i slowly walked her the head of the bed where harry sat very erect it looked like he was holding his breath harry nina nina harry i introduced feeling a bit stupid i picked her up and set her on the bed beside him hi nina he said quietly as if speaking louder might blow away the apparition of family of a baby sister he would love more than anything in no time hi she said is your arm better she asked looking pointedly at his forearm he nodded with a smile didnthurt at all his smile became more relaxed dad told me you like quiddich i smiled at him she nodded he had confided in sirius and i that he was nervous about meeting his sister that he didntknow what to say so we just told him to get her to talk to him about quiddich but mama wontlet me fly too high yet i heard her grin her reserve and shyness slipping away slowly but dad and padfoot say they re going to teach to fly and play what position do you like he asked sitting straighter but more relaxed keeper like mama she said brightly and you re a seeker right like dad used to be he nodded and looked up at with surprise in his eyes mom was a keeper yeah i laughed we all played quiddich at some point except for remus there so much i dontknow he sighed james remus called from the door i turned and saw him give piper and nina a smile hey piper hey nina he turned his attention to me dumbledore wants you in his office asap hope i not in trouble i said shrugging have fun and dontdrive pomfrey too crazy i kissed both my children on their head patted piper head like i would a mutt and walked towards remus how nina handling it he asked as we made our way through the halls running into a few students who looked like they d seen a ghost like she handled you and sirius with grace i smiled they re getting along so far i have a feeling he ll be very over protective of her remus grinned certainly shows the sign of an over protector i shrugged why does dumbledore want to see me brain storms first meeting of the order of the phoenix remus said you re enjoying this arentyou i smiled at him he looked at me sideways and a grin split his face you have no idea i laughed put my hand on his shoulder squeezing it fondly as we reached dumbledore office i still had my hand on his shoulder as he proceeded me into the office filled with the order members who had showed up they all froze like deer in headlights when they saw me all conversation stopped and all eyes turned to me walking behind remus like his 6 foot frame could hide the three inches i had on him hello i said slowly smiling i picked out a couple of faces immediately arthur dung emmeline and ex girlfriend the always heart stopping hestia jones oh my god hestia breathed and dropped into the chair behind as though she couldntstand on her legs any longer you re alive it true then i looked at her and smiled you know it i looked at the people around the table and couldnthelp chuckling c mon people you look like you re looking at a ghost trust me i corporeal arthur was the first to respond coming towards me from behind the big conference table smile in tact hand extended welcome back james he said enthusiastically as we shook hands very good to be back arthur i assured him clapping him on the shoulder in a quiet thanks for everything he d done for harry they welcomed me back one by one hestia throw herself in my arms and wept for a few minutes until emmeline managed to talk her out of the choke hold she had on me i smiled at her and wiped a tear from her face remembering how much i had loved this woman when i was younger that was just a memory now a wonderful memory of first kisses and first nights spent in a woman arms no more tears shed on our account hestia i smiled we re alright alive and kicking good she smiled at me her lip quivering you have no idea how good it is to know you werentmurdered ditto i smiled before the door of the office opened and lily came in and my heart fluttered in response to the smile she sent my way the order members spent a moment gawking over her as they had done with me until dumbledore finally asked if he could please start the meeting promising social hour after the important matters were out of the way sirius remus and i sat next to each other near the end of the table like we had done during the first war order meetings the three of us usually passed along comments and opinions quietly then spoke them aloud to the order after we had confirmed amongst ourselves we wouldntsound too psycho for suggesting whatever we were suggesting dumbledore as always stood very calmly at the head of the table looking serene and powerful and sweeter then hell all at the same time eyes sparkling looking at each member face in order lily had once confided in me that sometimes it felt that the order was a family dumbledore was the father macgonagall the mother the marauders were the mischievous brothers with dung being our cousin who we had brainwashed lily piper and kat had been the obedient daughters and so on and so forth and right now watching dumbledore scan the faces of the order he looked like a father breathing in all the fact that his family was reunited after years of horrible and unwanted separation because one of the boys had gone awry i think welcomes are in order he smiled sirius lily and james of course welcome back to life the three of us murmured a thanks in response i saw lily shrink into her chair across from me a slight blush on her cheeks cute and very yeah thought inspiring let just say i guess the statistics are right men do think about sex every 3 minutes in my case probably seconds of course you all have heard about the story behind everything that happened that horrible night so long ago he said calmly subtly ignoring hestia little gasp as silent tears fell streamed down from her striking blue eyes i caught lily giving me a narrow eyed look and i grinned at her she shook her head a smile quirking up the corners of her mouth and you all have been informed of the occurrences at the night of the third task of the triwizard tournament lord voldemort is back in power a collective shudder ran across the room missing the marauders and lily and piper who had left nina and harry together to catch up she had reported that they were so absorbed in each other that they hadntnoticed she as there at all prime minister fudge has refused time and again to believe that voldemort has come back to power dumbledore went on calmly a great speech maker he looked at all of us in turn jackass sirius muttered darkly dumbledore smiled at him and went on so it is left to us the order of the phoenix to protect the wizarding community until people begin to realize that voldemort is back and that we are at the brink of another war i sat back in my chair all sound blocked as i remembered the prophecy that horrid prophecy that proclaimed my son would either kill or be killed by voldemort that same prophecy that had started all this crap all this heartbreak i remember when we found out about it i nearly punched dumbledore for having heard it and delivering the news how would you feel if someone came to you and told you pointblank that your son was in eminent danger of being killed or becoming a killer after a few years or months of hunting enraged right that how i felt because dumbledore told me the only thing i could do was train my kid to kick some ass but thanks to that same little bastard named voldemort who just had to exist and be the devil spawn i couldnteven do that there only one thing that puzzles me about what happened during voldemort rebirth ceremony dumbledore coaxing me back to reality from the onset of bitter memories harry recalls dueling with voldemort and says that something happened with the wands i have found out that the phoenix my fawks in fact only gave two feathers and they were used for voldemort and harry wand wait my son and voldemort wand are brothers lily asked sitting up straighter dumbledore nodded that why the wands wouldntwork against each other the only thing that puzzles me is what happened when the wands connected and people voldemort had killed came back as apparitions the only people out of that group who hadntdied were lily and james everyone was quiet for a moment until lily spoke up well he killed those people using an unforgivable right she asked naturally dumbledore nodded encouragingly like we were in class he used the cruciatus on us that night i said knowing where lily was going maybe the wands to priori encantatum and all the unforgivable came out i theorized lily nodded it been known to happen sir dumbledore looked thoughtful as he rubbed his long beard in consideration if that is the case how can you explain the fact that the apparitions spoke to harry you james gave him directions on how to get back i remember reading somewhere that when someone has been submitted to something horrendous under magic gives a part of his or herself to the wand that committed the atrocity i said surprising everyone by proving that the years had made me grow up and i had taken responsibility at last and if you ve been as unfortunate to have experienced the cruciatus i betting something some part of lils and i was taken when he put us under the cruciatus that night and that small part recognized harry and helped him much like i would ve if i d been there myself that makes sense mcgonagall proclaimed the look on her face telling me she was surprised to be saying that about me dumbledore nodded again thoughtfully and proclaimed it made perfect sense can harry tell us who was there his death eaters elphias doge asked looking from dumbledore then to the end of the table at us we have mcnair grabbe goyle malfoy lily said and sirius and i both snarled at the last name we d been after malfoy since the first mention of death eaters and had captured him but he was freed because he can lie and he pretty the bastard but the auror wontdo anything about it and we donthave anyone in there except tonks and no offense sweetheart but you donthold that great a post tonks who had the brightest color of pink i d ever seen on her hair nodded with a smile what about shackelbot anybody talk to him yet sirius asked casually yes but he wasntable to get out of the ministry for the meeting dumbledore confided there had been a possible sighting of you in belgium and he been put in charge of tracking you down lovely he muttered as i laughed when will we get sirius cleared lily asked as soon as possible dumbledore said with the twinkle in his eyes making piper beam and glow now there a question of where we will use as headquarters we d offer the house or one of the mansions but they re too high risk i betting my ass er all the money that i have all the death eaters know them by now i smiled getting a few chuckles from around the table what about the noble and ancient house of black sirius asked suddenly i the last black so i inherited when my mother died i hate the place guts but my dad put thousand of wards and protection from muggles on it it impenetrable already and with a little work here and there ideal place thank you sirius i would like to visit the house soon if you please check the conditions and so forth dumbledore smiled yey sirius cheered sarcastically i remember the house sirius and his brother grew up in one word for it creepy i d been in the house only once and that was when i was an auror doing a search for a known death eater regulus black and sirius mother had just stared at me like a hawk the entire time making snide remarks about my best friend and dragging my parent name into the business so i naturally told her in the politest way to shut up or i d book her under the charge of disturbing an auror while he tries to concentrate she shut up immediately i knew what painful memories lay there for sirius not quite dormant old demons lingered there with unpleasant memories of a childhood that had been non existent and one i would only wish on the most evil of evils it would be tough for him to face those demons but my best friend is strong he can take it the meeting was dismissed and we went back to the hospital wing to harry and nina after exchanging greetings and catching up with our friends i found out that tonks is the daughter of sirius favorite cousin and a chick i used have a crush on when i was ten andromeda andy black now tonks and tonks first name is actually nympahdora odd family with odder names harry was sitting up in his bed with nina beside him and hermione ron and his brothers and his youngest sister a cute girl name ginny having fun lily smiled as we walked towards them they were talking about something all there questions on harry baby sister guess normality has settled in on him by now i know he must have great anger towards lily and i for abandoning him with the dursley for all those years but he too busy being happy that he has a mom a dad and a baby sister now he seems content with everything for now anyways god knows when that volcano will erupt and only he knows how i ll be singed omg 218 reviews i feel so warm andfuzzy inside and if you guys keep em comin like u have been since 22 you ll get a update faster so keep em comin love you mav ch 26 we meet again sirius and i were going crazy the day baby harry was going to be brought home from the hospital piper kat and lily were going to be his escort since i had been at work most of the day trying to find out who killed a muggle family sirius and i d barely made it home in time to see my baby boy come home for the first time and i hoped forever kids we re home piper called using her favorite nickname for the marauders despite the fact that we already had nicknames odd odd piper i was upstairs in the bathroom cleaning up and nearly fell down the stairs as i hurried down to watch my beautiful exhausted looking young wife come through the front door with harry in her arms kat carrying his car seat and piper with lily bags hi baby i said to lily putting my hands on the sleeping bundle i gave her a warm kiss home then bent down to my son hi baby to you too baby i smiled and kissed her forehead we d had a little party that night in harry honor though the honoree was asleep for most of the party and since 14 year old harry return was as important as his first entrance into our house we had a party in his honor too and this time he stayed up with us when i say everyone was in our backyard for the party i mean everyone all the weasley s the tonks family the grangers who were looking pretty comfortable for muggles and most of the order sirius and i had been put in charge of the barbecue that would be the main course for the night and we were dance around the grill cooking piper remus and lily were standing behind us shaking their heads disappointed that they d thought we d finally grown up and really hadn t our idiocy had only lain dormant waiting for a general consensus with god to come back and that was the minute we are reunited the idiocy and kookiness would become operational again seriously you guys remus laughed as harry joined us in our three man congo line around the grill dontruin the kid his choice i called going back to saying chachachacha chah chah yeah dontworry remus harry called between bouts of laughter at least leave nina piper begged and as if on cue nina ran forward and took her place in the crazy congo line in front of me just dontburn the burgers please some of us are hungry dumbledore said mildly pointedly looking at the burger that would ve become charcoal had i not reached it in time cursing as i did so sirius nina and harry were having a good ol laugh at my expense where did you learn to barbecue james i wasntaware wizards knew how to let alone an englishmen wizard gavin granger commented a few minutes later when we d settled down a bit everyone had a burger or hot dog in their hand with something to drink laughing and talking and all was right in the world i was hiding as a muggle for 13 years you get to learn some tricks when your use of magic is so limited i told him with a grin i liked the man he seemed pretty genuine and didntstand out like a soar thumb among the wizards and hermione reminded me a lot of lily when she was her age it was pretty damn weird i looked around and saw the weasley twins whispering to each other and i knew they were up to something i excused myself from gavin presence and walked towards the two boys what going on i asked with a cocked eyebrow i could tell from their eyes they were planning a prank sirius and my eyes became that bright when we were planning as well just keep watching sirius one of them said with a grin i watched sirius take a bite out of his sandwich and go on talking to piper and lily about something i turned the twins and cocked my eyebrow as they started fighting what the hell didntyou put the spell in it i was supposed to get the sandwich you re the one who was supposed to put the curse on it the other one yelled in frustration they both took a bite out of their hotdogs and immediately they turned purple with sudden chicken clucks escaping their mouths the look on their face was enough of a reward chuckling i slapped them on the back saying never mess with the marauder boys and walked over to sirius for an over due high five we d caught the boys jinxing the sandwiches and well touche i guess like i said never mess with the marauders everyone helped us clean up the mess in the backyard then headed home to rest because we were attacking the black mansion again the next day ron and harry had had the time of their lives and molly just barely managed to pry ron away from harry now my son was lying exhausted in his bedroom and nina had been having such an adrenaline rush i d spent an hour trying to get her to sleep and at last the house was quiet and it was just lily and i awake downstairs she dropped beside me on the couch with a sigh god i exhausted but that was the most fun we ve had in a while i told her kissing the top of her head as she wrapped her arms around my chest and rested her head on my shoulder tucking her long legs underneath her you have no idea lily murmured rubbing her face in my chest like a cat seeking comfort harry and nina had a lot of fun too i told her throwing my head back against the cushions of the couch i think nina realized what she was tonight where she came from i think that good for her lily said recalling the way everyone had adored nina the way her eyes were lit up the entire night talking with everyone playing with her brother and uncles i sure she had the time of her life and when mcgonagall showed her how she could turn into a cat nina had been ecstatic so i agreed yes it had been good for nina to meet everyone in the wizarding community to be shown exactly where she d come from i think so too i agreed mcgonagall seemed to just fall in love with her lily chuckled sleepily whoever doesntimmediately love our baby girl there something wrong with their brain true i nodded through a yawn that had my mouth opening wide and lasted for a while sleepy lily laughed watching me no i said with a grin taking my hand she led me up the stairs and to our bedroom i was so sleepy i didnteven try to dissuade her from putting on pajamas i just stripped to my boxers and slipped under the covers as lily ran through her usual bedtime preparations i fell asleep when she went to check up on the kids when i was finally thinking i was going to get a good nights sleep around 4 a m for some reason i just woke up and couldntfall asleep so i just lay there with lily curled up by my side listening to the groans and creaks of the house and the air conditioner as it tried to cool us from the 70 degree turlock weather as hard as i tried to hypnotize myself thinking about stories that usually made me fall asleep i couldn t i just couldntfall asleep it was the strangest thing like someone had put a curse on me that made me not want to get up then i reexamined the situation and figured out that i had woken up for a reason trepidation when i realized that i d thought i heard something in the house my ears pricked up considerably and cold chills ran down my spine i sat up on my elbows and looked through the darkness the tiny fine hairs at the back of my neck standing at attention james i heard lily whisper lazily though her voice as alert as usual what wrong nothin i muttered well was about to when to simultaneous screams raised the roof of the house one of them a chilling daddy and the other one was the sound of a boy whose voice was changing i dontknow how fast lily and i jumped out of bed and grabbed our wands my years as an auror making me faster then lily i skid to the halt in front of the kids rooms that were attached to each other well well well mr potter we meet again a chilling voice said coming from nina bedroom an i know it took a while but i going through some crises right now but 27 is on its way god have mercy 28 love you guys and i sooo sorry btw rock on englad been watching the world cup lol beckham baby yeah disclaimer not mine well i wrote it but nevermind you know what i mean credit to jkr and kmm ch 28 the deep end it didnttake long for me to recover thanks to magic and my own good health i a fast healer i would rather die then have my family go back to that house so i ordered sirius to take them to the black manor we would be staying there and i was going to add more wards to the house sirius was going to be my escort from the ministry since we were both back being aurors so i dragged him back to the house in california so we could pick up items that were necessary my family was losing another home i finally thought we d found a house that we could build memories in but just like that we had to get out of the house that was our home we had made our lives had made cherished memories in both houses i could go back to the rubble that was our house at godric hollow and still be able to pinpoint exactly where harry had taken his first step or the first time he threw up on me leaving that house lily and dumbledore forcing me away from it convincing me not to fix it up had been a stab in my heart but i d refused to sell it it still my property too much memories too many firsts in that house it was just as terrible to have to move out of the house in turlock it was where nina had taken her first steps said her first words had grown up in if this move was hard on lily and i imagine what nina feeling it the only home she known and there a certain benefit of growing up in one house i ve known that benefit that sense of security and a sort of peace to be able to sit in front of the mantel place at age 22 and have your father tell you took your first step right there there something special about that and the fact that my kids couldnthave that as far as i could tell anyway was a devastating thing but i just grateful they re gonna be surrounded by family and friends who love them almost as much i love them and protect them as much as i want to cradling boxes and a few bags sirius dissaparated to our new home the black manor i stood standing in the living room just standing there like someone possessed not wanting to go to admit defeat yet again i wondered aimlessly throughout the house going to our bedroom my hand passing over the bed memories flashing of lily laughing sleeping in the throws of ecstasy i went to nina bedroom good memories of my baby girl overriding the bad ones that were so recent i picked up her favorite stuffed toy the blue alien from that disney movie she was addicted to lilo and stitch she d grown up from baby to little girl in this room an ever present touch stone for her father and i dontthink she even realized it we had basically packed the library literally packed it and we were going to reopen it and make it a part of the black manor too many books that would help us were in the library and the library itself had precious magic inside so we decided to pack it dumbledore had agreed with us that we would need the room itself not just the books i was back in the living room staring at the couch where lily and i had so many conversations so many moments of intimacies of countless kinds i didntwant to leave and i realized that there were unshed tears in my eyes i didntlet them fall didntwant to show another sign of weakness so i just whipped them away by pressing my fingers against my eyes this wasntsurrender it was just going to add fuel to my fire more reason to kill voldemort to help destroy him to a pile of dog shit that no one not even his faithful servants would dare touch this was my declaration of war this was where voldemort had crossed the fine line i didntjust hate him and want him dead i loathed him with every fiber of my body and didntwanted him to suddenly drop dead and die i wanted him to suffer to scream from pain and agony to have his body separated from itself just like i had been separated from my body my flesh and blood for 13 years maybe voldemort hadntcrossed the line but i had crossed the line from concerned and over protective father to vengeful psycho but if it would kill no destroy voldemort then being a vengeful psycho didntmatter i declared war on voldemort destroying him to bits and pieces was my new mission in life and i would see it through even if it killed me i had gone off the deep end standing there alone jaw clenched and fists balled voldemort was soo screwed chaotic nor hectic could describe the situation at the black manor during dinner that night molly and lily had cooked a feast fit for a king with the help of the rest of the girls most of the members of the order had arrived for dinner and walking in to the grim house you wouldnthave noticed the grimness anyway and you wouldnthave guessed that there was a war going on and we were the soldiers laughter kept exploding here and there over the conversations over dinner molly yelled at the twins now and then lily threw a brisket at me or harry it was just great dung remus sirius and i were sitting at the far end of the table with the twins and talking about god knows what i think we were recalling something we d done back in school if i not mistaken from the other end dumbledore eyes looked like they could pass off as the moon the sparkled so much he looked like what i told you before a father who had all his children back and it seemed that his children were as happy as he was about being back together mcgonagall and nina had seemed to hit off the old woman really loved nina and had actually enjoyed playing and talking to my baby girl the professor had been a little disappointed when i told her i d been cian the old professor but then she d laughed and forgiven me after i begged her to just for show she had changed alright had become more softer and let the mother instincts reign her sometimes and nina and harry were having the times of their lives harry didntseem to mind having his baby sister tag along with him and his friends all over the house he actually seemed to want her tailing him i remember piper and her brother paisley arguing and fighting with each other because piper had wanted to tag along with her older brother too but i didntsee that kind of sibling squabbling among these two lily put nina to bed after dinner and my little girl did a cursory tour of the kitchen giving everyone necessary a hug and kiss that was sitting around the table before she went off to bed love you baby i said into her ear as she hugged me love you too daddy she said and kissed my cheek giving me more sugar since i was her dad good night cookie monster i smiled she replied with a grin ran to her mother and took her hand and was led upstairs to bed nina going to bed cast a spell around the table tension crackled in the air as everyone realized we were going to be discussing war strategies before long it was molly who shooed the kids away alright now she said standing up everyone go upstairs she said can we stay the twins asked in unison absolutely not was the pert reply harry green eyes turned to me in hope i shook my head at his silent plea no chance emeralds but c mon voldemort after me i should know these things he said a little anger edging his voice if there anything you need to know i ll tell you i promise now go upstairs please i said fine he sighed and stood up leading his friends upstairs to their rooms now then dumbledore said standing up as the table cleared itself i stood up raising my hand and went towards the closed kitchen door and cast a silencing charm around us and sure enough i heard groans as i did so turning back to the crowd i grinned continue professor i said to dumbledore and smugly sat down lily and piper both threw their pens at me and i laughed dumbledore basically told us that fudge still refused to acknowledge the fact that voldemort had come back to power and had the entire wizarding world convinced that it had been a figment of harry traumatized mind i had a suspicion it was fudge who was traumatized and didntwant to acknowledge it james do you remember i told you about the legend of the draghar dumbledore asked me yeah i nodded of course i did my grandda used to tell me the story of the 13 evil druids when i was kid they d been banished by the tuathe de dannan the fae gods of scotland and were in basic nothingness ever since but if anyone released the 13 ancient ones we were screwed because they d join voldemort in a heartbeat what about em i asked it has been brought to my attention that voldemort does indeed know where the draghar are he told me oh shit i muttered it seemed that except for lily mcgonagall and i no one else knew what the hell we were talking about but he hasntunleashed them has he not yet he said quietly not yet crap that not good not yet leaves too much open ground for speculation not yet means there still time to unleash the evil of the 13 i couldntimagine the destruction they would rain on the world it was be hell on earth and the way i understood it my son was the only thing that could protect us from that there anyway to kill the draghar hestia asked after dumbledore explained to them who the draghar were only the queen of the tuathe de can aoibheal he answered her with a grave face have you talked to her about it emmeline asked can you talk to her sirius asked with a cocked eyebrow as he reclined back in his seat with a mug in his hand yes i have made the proper arrangements with the keltar family dumbledore answered like we all knew who the hell the keltar were and they are i asked with a cocked eyebrow they keep the fae and the real world apart invisible they are the barrier of two different worlds and are the only druids who are entrusted with the power dumbledore told us so they re supposed to help you talk to aiobheal lily asked a little fear creeping up into her voice dumbledore nodded at her i will plea with her to destroy the draghar as soon as possible and this fairy queen will she listen to you i asked a little skeptical i have spoken with aoibheal before she listens to reason and only reason i trust she will see the good in destroying the 13 he said confidently with a nod lets run worse case scenario here sir remus said intelligently while i noticed the way hestia gawked at him hehe hestia has a crush on remmy what if she wants to be stubborn and not destroy the draghar what then then we re screwed right i asked cocking my eyebrow at dumbledore there are ways of fighting them but he shook his head but no one who has used those ways has succeeded so we are screwed piper exclaimed putting it mildly yes we are dumbledore told her gently his eyes the eyes of a father who was telling his daughter that her dog had just been killed what the worse damage they can do professor lily asked leaning towards me wordlessly telling me she wanted comfort so i very quietly put my arm around her shoulders and kissed her forehead it ll be ok i whispered in her ear her answer was to squeeze my thigh the draghar when they were released mistakenly a few years ago possessed a human body and forced him to do their bidding dumbledore answered rubbing his long beard the man whose body they possessed was forced by the draghar to kill himself to fully posses the body yep sirius nodded vigorously sitting up we re screwed so they re going to posses someone and force that person to commit suicide and fully take over the body so 13 evil druids can wreak havoc all over the world arthur summed it up frankly it can be anyone and any idea who sir anyone with a mind weak enough yes dumbledore told her i suspect that voldemort will hand deliver them a body and i think the order can relax in this because voldemort knows our minds are not weak so he will offer a death eater instead because their minds are how shall i put this they re stupid sirius suggested checking his nails for dirt buffing and polishing them on his shirt some may not even have brains i heard remus mutter flaccid minds maybe i asked flaccid remus asked turning to me i shrugged every death eater has a droopy mind therefore are susceptible to 13 evil druids penetrating their minds convincing them to commit suicide i grinned i think that a flaccid mind i agree sirius said personally i hope they take bellatrix or malfoy then under his breath he muttered 13 evil druids is better then those assholes i was the only one near enough to him to hear what he said and i smacked him upside the head everyone was at least chuckling when sirius yelped even mcgonagall was trying to hide a smile i reclined back on my chair so that it was on its two hind legs its nice have the kids back isntsir i asked no one in particular indeed dumbledore agreed and of all the suggestions boys i take flaccid it is insulting and intelligent sounding at the same time thank you i said smugly can we get back to the issue at hand please molly asked of course dumbledore nodded sir lily said suddenly becoming very still sitting up like she had a hot poker for a spine can can the draghar get into harry i mean if voldemort wanted to kill harry 13 evil druids it seemed that no one had thought about that i certainly hadn t well i hadntled my mind wonder there in fear of what i would think i couldntimagine my son having 13 sons of bitches living in his mind and what they d drive him towards i just didntwant to think about it at all i think harry has a strong mind and under our protection no draghar will be able to lay a finger on his mind mcgonagall said quit fiercely lily looked at her as surprised by the professor promise as i was the two woman looked at each other for a time then lils nodded as something passed between the two an over protective mcgonagall i could get used to her so what the next step i asked i will speak with aiobheal then we will see dumbledore answered right now our intelligence will gather us the information we need and we will go from there everyone murmured sounds good and simultaneously decided it was time to go home the weasley had decided to stay at the house with us and we were glad because the kids could have some distractions being 15 years old and caught in the middle of one of the biggest wars in the wizarding world is pretty hard the marauders were well into their 20 when the war began and i dontthink we ve fully recovered from the effects of the war nina and ginny were sharing a room next to the boys so lily and i were alone she curled herself around my body fitting every nook and cranny of hers to fit mine like she was afraid to be away from me and i felt her tears come in a rush sobs that made her shoulders quake and i couldntdo anything but hold her against my chest and promise her that i d rather die then let anything happen to our kids she kept sobbing i kept seething and crooning an hey apparantly there been some confusion on the part about the dates well i going by my dating since i dontpossess the mathmatical brain needed for the calculation of the dates and stuff so this is our time k spoiler god c mon if i was rich and owned these characters dontyou thik the entire book would ve been sirius black and the order of pheonix instead of harry ch 3 i waited for hope my conversation with sirius somehow managed to put me in a better mood a better place our hippie friends would undoubtedly say sirius already haunted gaunt eyes followed me everywhere i went in the mansion still alone with guilt and more guilt to keep me company but the speck of hope in his eyes just rejuvenated me into thinking that someday we would end up together again in one room with remus and harry with us here i was sitting going out towards the beautiful forest that ran for the backyard of the house and i was miserable in beautiful monte carlo and so hopeless seemingly having inherited my mother in law pessimism and a man was sitting in a tiny dark dingy cell in the worlds most feared and loathed place could still have hope how stupid can you feel his hope gave me hope and hopefully my hope would rub off on lily i couldntgo back to sleep so i decided to go out for a walk or a jog by the lake in the middle of the woods having been mad eye moody favorite student left you with one impressionable impact of constant vigelance so i took my wand with me and my sometimes paranoid and impetuous auror senses were on the edge picking up a snake slithering in the grass putting my hands in my connecting pockets in front of my navy blue sweatshirt i walked with the hood on thinking how funny it would be if lily were to come back and curse me because she mistook me for being a death eater i smiled we both would have a good laugh well unless she went overboard and i ended up in a really sticky situation then we couldntlaugh about it but we both needed something to laugh about something no matter how stupid it or how desperate if i could get her to laugh i would be happy her laughter along with harry was music to my ears joy in my very heart i let my mind become buried in hopeful ideas that someday i would see harry and he would see me and call me dad like his birthright how fun it would be to be reacquainted with my boy and he with me i couldntwait now and i knew it wouldntbe soon but it would come one day some day but not soon enough but still it would come hey sweetheart i heard lily sweet voice behind me i turned around and saw her her cheeks flushed with a smile ever present on her lips as she looked up at me hey i smiled as i took her into my arms kissing her cheek did you talk to sirius she asked me yeah he contacted me a few minutes ago i told her stroking her hair as i enjoyed her fingers in the hair at my nape he looked terrible she whispered her chin on my shoulder i didntexpect better i told her he in azkaban we still thinking of breaking him out she asked pulling back and looking at me of course i smiled it wouldntbe marauder fashion if we didntbust the poor guy out now would it i asked no she said dryly the two of you will grow to be i think eighty and never hesitate from calling yourselves the marauders will you hey we re proud we set the hogwarts record for the most detentions wouldntyou be proud of that i asked catching a strand of her hair and pushing it behind her ear she shook her head narrowing her eyes not particularly i kissed her that why we re the marauders right she nodded i went to see remus i cocked an eyebrow in my animagus form you dick she hissed i nodded as she laughed seriously my mind is loosing it grip how is he drunk she said bluntly i clenched my teeth guess he not exactly taking it all that well eh i dontblame him poor guy she sighed they were holding a memorial service for us when i got there dumbledore recognized me i frowned you went to our funeral she nodded weird i know there is no odder feeling then asking the following question who gave our eulogy remus obviously she answered he broke down saying that our bodies had been burnt to a cinder thanks to the fire so they couldntbury us poor remus i said closing my eyes hoping it would make it go away some how still hoping this was a nightmare and i was about to wake up to the alarm clock and pound the snooze button with my fist because i didntwant to go to work yeah she sighed i guess you were right when you said he got the worst end of the deal i haventseen him so distraught since his parent death he was in tatters all i wanted to do was go up to him and hug who else was there the order of pheonix half of the gryffindor during our time and the professors and surprisingly my sister she said her eyes hinting something i caught her drift my breath jammed in my chest did she bring harry yeah she nodded tears pooling in her eyes yeah she did my mouth gaped as i struggled for breath why it was so hard i have no clue but it hurt it stung to no end how did he look i chocked out his scar was still burning brightly but he looked good she nodded glowing no burning as in like a scar a few days after oh i nodded but he good yes she assured me and let silence pass i want him back she confessed yeah me too i nodded as she put her arms my neck me too i breathed loosing all the naive hope sirius had helped develop as she sobbed on my shoulder shouldntwe have already accepted this she whimpered i think we re give the right to never get used to it my heart i told her kissing her cheek i miss him i miss remus i miss our home our friends she pulled back with eyes matching her hair i miss our life seeing you smile i kissed her exquisite brow we ll make it it ll hurt but we ll soldier on k i asked her for i think the millionth time she nodded suddenly looking calm as she stared into my eyes searching for eternity it seemed james hmm i asked my hands on her waist make love to me she said catching me totally off guard like that first time i had heard those words her request whispered with such passion cut my legs off my throat was too dry to answer so i just kissed her i heard a moan as i parted her lips with my tongue demanding a hungry entrance my tongue found her enticed it to follow my lusty lead as we danced the familiar love dance soon i noticed she was ripping off my shirt and i hers in our room our jeans flew across the room followed by any intruding under garments as i lay on top of her beautiful body my body growing to infernal temperatures as it assumed its husbandly duties oh i love you she whispered as i worked on her chest nestled between her thighs she kept moaning as my fingers played inside her and she exploded as i entered her she clutched my shoulder painfully i smiled my mind going back to another time our first time it was the night before the last of our finals in our sixth year at hogwarts the marauders and two of the girls were sitting in the common room in front of the warmth less fire kat and remus were curled up studying each other in the privacy of a massive book piper and sirius were sitting on the ground quizzing each other while i tried not to punch out peter because i was trying to help him with transfiguration peter i moaned c mon man you re an animagus this shouldntbe that hard yeah make the marauder proud piper smiled ok what the wand movement for transfiguring a goddamn goblet into a freakin book i asked before i had a chance to jump on peter throat i heard light and quick footsteps coming down hey lils smiled piper her head perking up my body shivered lily evens always had that effect on me hey piper i heard her velvety voice say quietly nice pj evens sirius smirked i could tell from his eyes he was begging me too look over at her but i had long ago given up trying to get her i could practically see her glare at him i still hadntlooked at her too intimated and frankly embarrassed for the way i acted around her for five years hey uh potter can can i talk to you i had never been so shocked in my life i turned to look at her wearing a spaghetti top and blue bottoms my breath jammed in my throat at the site of her beautiful green eyes distraught i frowned me yeah she nodded i shot a glance towards sirius who widened his eyes with a shrug ah sure i smiled and stood up slapping peter upside the head as he started to complain um where do you wanna go somewhere privet she said eyeing the group even kat and remus had stopped studying to listen i grabbed her elbow expecting her to thrust it in my ribs but didntas i led her to the boys empty dorms uh yeah no one here i mumbled closing the dorm door behind me embarrassed since the marauders never felt the need to clean up fitting she swallowed um lily are you alright yeah i guess she looked nervous i have a request james um ok i was nervous beyond any realm of human understanding to hear my first name finally come out of her beautiful succulent lips make love to me she whispered presently as i lay on her exhausted i remember the shock of those straight forward words i think i wouldnthave noticed if a bolt of lightning struck me too much shock of those words that request that sincerity but you hate me i reminded her that what you think she smiled inching closer to me i could count her long eyelashes lily maybe we should take it easy i whispered not being able to resist the temptation to twist a strand of hair around my finger she let out a struggled breath i dontwant to do you know how bad i ve wanted to be with you to kiss you hold you call you mine then why have you been turning me down i asked her hands on my waist now i could smell her lavender scented hair i dontknow she whispered lily i i just can t bang you before we even go out on one date i said pleading for logic to keep me in its grip it would be wrong let do things backwards then we spend a night together then start dating she whispered tracing my bottom lip soon i found myself in her arms just like i am now six years later lily slept on my chest as i deftly traced patterns on her arm staring at the ceiling of our massive room in the ch teau i had forgotten just how exquisite life could be how ripe how so extremely aw inspiring to be able to look at your wife lost inside you how much i love lily words will never tell all the beautiful poetry all the fancy words all the praises i could use to describe my lily i would still surely come up short for there was nothing like her ever the numerous shades of red in her hair the way her eyes sparkled when she looked at me or harry her lips twitching into a smile as she tried to hide a surprise from me and the way her eyes just pierced into my soul their intensity doubled as she tells me she loves me and again no musky words could describe my beautiful flower believe you me i ve tried sleep she murmured burying her head in my neck i smiled and kissed the top of her head as her arm secured my torso closer to hers i will i assured her now sweetheart she said her voice muffled by my throat i jumped slightly as her breath tickled me dontworry bout me lils i said hoping she would go back to her slumber yea right my lily actually give up on something c mon you have slept in nearly two days well at least we thought i didn t i shrugged off the incident of losing track of time alright i said and closed my eyes twining both my arms around her body and turned to face her on my side my eyes were open and i saw her look at me with her jewels her grin broadened as i slid lower to her and she wrapped her arms around my waist her face buried in my throat again as we settled down our legs in a labyrinth i felt her kiss my throat i love you james she whispered if possible i squeezed her closer i love you too lils always and forever and so 5 years passed by lily and i had moved into a small town in central california by the name of turlock the city didnthave a wizarding family for miles in face dumbledore had chosen california because there was only one other wizard family in the entire state we had gotten a house in a suburban neighborhood near an elementary school and adopted the identity of james and lily pierce a young couple who were childless and very lovable the two of us were now 26 years old and craved our life back but we knew it wouldnthappen so we just made the best of this one i posed as a strapping young husband still haventlost my bighead who just graduated from college which is like the last year of hogwarts in our world and had gotten a job as physical education teacher dumbledore had used a charm on me that gave me all the information and training i needed to teach 12 and 13 year olds how to play particular games muggle games i should add are the most boring vulgar and humiliating games ever i hate them but words gotten back to me that all my students love me so i happy about that lily models as the perfect housewife that she is who would rather stay home and take care of the house and her husband but lils spend the time at home pouring over books to find a way to bust sirius out every man in the neighborhood envied me for my wife and every women craved to be her not only because she was so gracefully nice and good at everything but also because as a joke i had gotten into the habit of mowing the lawn shirtless on saturday mornings because apparently american muggles have grass growing in their front and backyard my pretty wife while laughing said that marauder blood would never stop running through my veins nor my self confidence but we craved starved prayed for the day when we could go back to england to see our friends again be able to be us and not just some phantom picture perfect ordinary couple i dontknow how many nights i ve stayed up my brain engulfing me in precious memories of my friends and my son our simple days in hogwarts and the short quiet period when sirius and i trained to become aurors while courting two beautiful women we d no doubt die for and while we helped remus out in whatever way we could to help him plant his feet into the world and peter we never saw much of him god i missed them all even peter at times i missed everything that had to do with england and wizardry the excitement and yes even the danger of having so much power at your fingertips called me back being muggle was too safe i wanted the danger the spontaneity being a wizard offered i wanted to live with the constant fear that something was going to jump me embark on a new adventure everyday i expressed these thoughts to lily once she asked if i wanted back the danger that had put us here i admit i said yes i bored out of my wits and sad beyond my realm of understanding one of the things that weighed so heavily on my heart is sirius day and day i watch my best friend fade away behind a mirror we had used as kids in separate detentions i swear if i kept a daily track of how he looked you could see his eyes become more haunted by the minute no second i wanted him out of azkaban i wanted him free and taking care of my son if i wasntthere to do it but no idiot that fudge was never gave my best friend one of the greatest auror ever to set foot in the godforsaken ministry a chance to prove himself innocent if i had half a mind i would march up to fudge door and shake him to his senses and so it goes presently it was a saturday morning in turlock famous for its 100 degree weather in june july and august and god help me it was the end of june i was asleep on my stomach awake since 8 o clock but was hoping to go back to sleep if i just managed to close my eyes long enough in that comfortable position on my stomach i felt the beds weight shift and a hand in my now long hair thankyouverymuch and it aintstanding in every direction almost like sirius when he was free wake up baby i heard her whisper in my ear i miss our english accents too we re full force apple pie americans now no i grumbled stuffing my face deeper in the pillow yes she smiled kissing my shoulder it nearly 10 so i asked she chuckled c mon breakfast then you need to move the lawn dare i say that ol mrs dubose is sitting outside in her garage waiting for the show to begin we both laughed i into my pillow and lily into my shoulder should be interesting then i smiled alright i up k see you downstairs then my love she smiled kissed me on the cheek and went downstairs i got up stretched decided to take a shower after sweating like a pig in the sun and went downstairs wearing only my bottoms morning lils i said finding her standing next to the stove in the kitchen i caught her from the back and kissed her cheek morning you sluggabed she smiled putting a hand on my cheek how d you sleep miserably i answered mmm i could tell she turned around in my arms leaving the bacon to fry for another few minutes what were you dreaming about i cocked an eyebrow how d you know i had a bad dream you were writhing around in the bed she said with concerned eyes i smiled kissing her forehead i said just reliving an old terror nothing new i had been dreaming about that famous night constantly since we left monte carlo and the dreams er reality of the dream never ceased to keep me up nights afraid to close my eyes and see harry eyes pleading with me to save him i shook the thoughts out of my head it wasnta good time to relive his beseeching looks it was no time to fall apart you alright now she asked yes love i answered with a smile i dontthink i could feel you promise yes i said she stood on tiptoes and kissed my lips with a smile go sit down breakfast is almost ready right i said and picked up the daily prophet and read nothing exciting or important seemed to happen except a possible sighting of voldermort in russia which sounded a bit peculiar considering that an old bat had claimed to have seen him ere you go said lily putting a mug filled with coffee in front of me and one for herself with a plate of eggs bacon and flapjacks in front of us both we began to eat i had an idea she said quietly not your first my love i smiled sipping my coffee burning my lips and tongue idiot that i am um why not go visit harry i chocked on my coffee eh i asked you heard me she said quietly sweetheart um i struggled searching her eyes how i dunno i can be stray cat and you can i dunno pretend to be the meter man or someone taking a survey or something she pleaded i looked at her lily but my speech about her going crazy was cut short when i saw tears in her eyes come here i said and she slowly walked towards me sitting in my lap with her head on my shoulder her arms painfully squeezing me talk to me i miss him she said i do too i told her i wanna see him then we ll have our heads cut off i smiled oh well she whispered i gave up and let her cry silently against my shoulder knowing no salve could be applied to neither of our wounds dontthink me selfish or something but i think i have more lesions to see my son ripped from me my brother chucked up in azkaban and my wife in tears everyday well more pain for me i guess and so i used the silence to think of some way that we could go to surrey and see our creation i must say never have i been this glad to have marauder blood in me i had an idea lily could disguise herself as a cat one of her main animagus forms thanks to her remarkable powers and i could do a little touch up on my face and go around privet drive and hopefully catch a glimpse of harry while knocking on every door to try and find my lost cat i told her the plan the smile i got was worth every pain i love you have i told you that lately she asked kissing my cheek um last night in bed you were screaming it i said and she giggled as a little red took over her cheeks guess what i love you too i said and kissed her forehead she sighed when do we leave well it summer here and so hogwarts is out i think we should spend some time with dumbledore and let him fill us in on anything we missed then head to little whinning and our son i said i say wednesday so we can set our affairs here in order she nodded how long will we stay i smiled i think i can manage to perusal the streets in different guises for a week while you play the lovable stray kitty lily laughed i like that idea she smiled a week it is k now get off me love i have lawns to mow i smiled she laughed but got off at least get some jeans on you dick she smiled right o i said and ran up the stairs finding an old pair of tight fitting jeans and putting on a cap displaying the words ppmlh backwards with my hair pulled back in a pony tail i was set by the way in case you re wondering ppmlh stands for padfoot prongs moon lily and harry dontgo thinking i joined a gang or something i hate sharing your torso with all these women james lily whimpered playfully i lifted an eyebrow as i put my arm around her shoulders and we went out to the garage together you re not jealous now are you i asked as the door lifted up noisily depends my love have you loved any of these women like you loved me last night she asked with a smirk never in my life have i been so exuberant in bed lils i laughed good then i not jealous she said and kissed my cheek across the street sat an old lady next to a younger neighbor of ours hello mrs dubose miss maudie lily waved with a kind smile hello the both greeted and as i tried to stifle a laugh the looked at me thoroughly mowing the lawn again james miss maudie the younger one asked yeah i smiled it getting as tall as i am they both giggled reminding me of the girls in hogwarts gotta say i sorry about the noise that thing makes i recommend you go inside if it bugs you always the gentleman lily whispered from next to me her arm around my waist no no it fine dear mrs dubose said as i noticed more women emerging sirius would be proud of my odd prank you sure i asked yes they both said simultaneously alright i nodded and turned to me wife i ll make you some lemonade love she said and kissed my shoulder and headed towards the house again and donttake that the wrong way right you are i said and walked with measured and calculated long strides towards the massive crass cutting machine i pulled it out and drove it towards one section of the grass then finally got what she meant and laughed pulling the string to start it a few times i began torturing the ladies of crowell road my mind filled with wednesday i finished mowing the lawn and my body was slick with sweat god you look good james lily whispered she d been standing on the sidewalk and conversing with one of the neighbors before she walked towards me i growled the bedroom is very close to us my heart better yet the couch i smiled drinking from the cool water bottle she had given me she smiled get that machine inside and i ll see you inside i laughed and i dontknow how fast i put the cutter back in the corner of the garage and ran inside to find her sitting on the couch with an innocent smile playing at her lips she was sitting on her knees i could see the white tank top had some wet areas especially on the chest right above her assets you dirty dirty girl i smiled and found myself lunging towards her and yet again trapped helplessly in her intricate web of the love she for some reason possessed for me an hey guys thanks for reviewing though still the amount isntsatisfactory you dontknow how much i appreciate your kind words of encourgment i love you and i so proud of

you really like me it reviews like these that makes you my favorite lol and you ve bee reviewing since the return right smurfinator hehe i know the chapter was sad but gahd i cantfind any happiness for these people lol what do you think of this one tira host sad story is my middle name darlin thank you all for the reviews mav pierce ch 31 blues from down here to me death had never been something to think about as an escape or a way to end a misery or an outlet of some sort my parents were avid advocates for the preservation of life and the enjoyment of it and to live every second without wasting it and with lily my kids sirius and everyone else surrounding me who would want to leave or ever think about leaving you d have to be out of your mind but with 13 evil druids living inside me sharing my skin without any kind of permission i wanted to run myself into the wall to escape them they keep me awake all night invaded raped my thoughts brutally during the day i have no peace now none of the solemnity and restitute i had worked so hard to get it i looked at lily the female would pounce in my brain and tell me of how deceitful my wife is of how many times she d told me how many times she had hurt me on purpose i looked at nina they spoke of thoughts of murder when i looked or even thought about harry my mind was flat out assaulted it pretty terrible not being alone in your thoughts to have 13 other people occupy you i cantescape them their constant buzzing in my brain god help me i hate this the past three months have been torture surely a circle of hell dante hadntthought of but god is merciful in giving me a few outs making love to lily helped when i not afraid of hurting her somehow i guess the amount of love i feel for her draws me out more and drowns the 13 and jesus does holding nina help burying my face in her sweet smelling hair as she attempted to read to me my baby girl has become a strong lifeline then i ever expected everyone including lily has developed a certain fear of me that i donthold against them my new violent and volatile temper scares everyone including me more than once i ve run out of the house because if i didn t the 13 wouldntshut up and they would drive me fill me with thoughts that werentmy own thoughts james potter could never have imagined on his own and while i sat under the tree in the massive field and while i stopped on top of the crest in what served as our backyard the most precious thing in the world would approach strong in her innocence my baby girl would approach me crawling in my lap wonderfully and lay her cheek against my heart as they told me to kill her but the feel of her cheek against my heart my very car and they would shut up immediately her tiny arms would around my face and peace daddy why are you so sad she d asked more than once i wonder if she realizes that her point blank question her no fear attitude towards me now shows more bravery than all the order combined she ll be such a unique woman brave sweet and gentle with a ferocity a rose with thorns i often what she ll become when she grows up i just know she ll be wonderful death is imminent i not going to see lily age harry graduate hogwarts and nina starting school it a fact i trying to get used to pretty soon i ll die pretty soon i ll cease breathing and pretty soon i will only be a painful memory in the minds of people who love me and i really dontknow where i ll go and i cantsay if i want to remember them i selfish i want to go first because i canttake the idea of losing any of them it would destroy me i not resilient i not brave enough to face it my parents death had hurt like hell like someone had slowly stripped off my skin it had hurt so much and losing harry sirius remus and everyone else when we went into hiding had destroyed me but i had known i would be with them again that why i survived but knowing that i ll never be able to see them again would surely kill me this constant contemplation of life and death has now been deeply imbedded in my day and the constant thought of will today be the day has cauterized my soul james now i heard someone ask i looked up from my study of the grass outside to see remus standing over me he looked pale and old a look we d all hideously perfected i probably look worse then moony which is saying something i kid you not i have white hair at my temple you alright he asked cautiously sitting next to me my best friend since age 11 and he scared of me sure i smiled bravely sin of a bitch he a freak he shouldntbe alive he dangerous he ll betray you just like peter you remember peter how close he and remus were how do you know remus doesntwant to kill you maybe he in league with the werewolves working for voldemort kill him james or he ll kill lily and nina and harry and make you watch i groaned grabbing my hair knowing that ripping it all out by the roots would not help me nor would i ever escape and one day i would listen to their whispers in my mind i could run away isolate myself somewhere until they figured out how to kill the 13 without killing me but i can tleave them i cantleave my family my friends i have to protect them the sly female voice whispered even from yourself james goddamn it i yelled springing up like it would stop the voices hoping i could escape god i want this to stop i looked at the horrified remus as reached out to me no i backed away from him my eyes no doubt wild and desperate please donttouch me remus please but the idiot persisted reverently reaching out to me again james come on remus just stop i said desperately tears clogging my throat donttouch me dontlook at me dontspeak to me stop loving me hate me for all my thoughts dontlet me hurt you promise to kill me if i raise my hand against please dontlet me hurt you please i found the will to return home 5 hours after running away but i couldntstay away couldntkeep away from my precious family the house was silent even mrs black was asleep the silence wasnteerie but comfortable because a family lived here and now they all slept in peace maybe not peace heading to the kitchen for some food before going to bed i was surprised to see the light on from upstairs looking down into the kitchen 2 voices floated up i worried sirius that was lily i know he replied i worried too you dontthink he ll hurt himself do you she whispered would you really be surprised if you went downstairs right now to find him fucking her they ve always been attracted to each other i denied it vehemently sirius and lily loved me they wouldntdo that to me both had too much loyalty to even think about doing such a vile thing oh yeah how bout all those nights you came home from work and he d be there i doubled over as i tried to block out the sounds god my brain hurt it throbbed like it would blow up soon they d never do that to me they d die first because they love me i know they do a whisper haventyou ever noticed how attached harry is to sirius like sirius is his father that stupid harry looks like my twin this coming from the man whose wife changed his appearance to make him look like a god you re a sorcerer james you there are spells that can permanently alter appearances no they would never hurt me like that never but sirius was at our house quite a lot even when i wasn t and i ve always felt like lily was attracted to sirius and vice versa the attraction was there the odd hours and looks i crashed into the wall the throbbing in my shoulder going unnoticed these arentmy thoughts they re not valid not mine someone stop this stop this pain god help me james james i heard lily exclaim running up the stairs to me she knelt beside me her hands cool against my cheeks her tears a knife in my heart sweetheart are you ok what happened sirius asked with alarm in his voice as he zipped up his pants no finish this sirius i begged him tears spilling down my cheeks as i reached out for him he took my hand squeezed as hard as i was squeezing his please end this finish this i i cantstand it anymore no james fuck no actually he said we ll no we wont i ll never escape this kill me before i hurt anybody james calm down please lily sobbed stroking my hair kissing my cheeks knowing she was calming me we ll get through this i looked at her beautiful face drowned in her beautiful eyes died that i would hurt her that i mistrusted this angel my angel and i had to tell her the truth they re gaining power sweet i dontthink there a peaceful solution she kissed me slowly reverently licking the inside of my mouth when all i was allowed to think was that she d been with sirius that she d hurt me that she had sex with my best friend on our bed i pulled back and screamed screamed until i drowned the voices until my throat was raw until the universe heard my pain finish me i canttake this anymore i saw tears in padfoot eyes as he raise his wand bright light flashed from the tip of his wand then peaceful darkness muhahahahhah ch 31 blues from up here someone was kissing my throat my shoulders now moving steadily enticingly slowly to my chest now my abdomen if this wasntheaven it sure as hell felt like it damn that mouth was incredible and so achingly familiar wait i cracked my eyes open and looked down at my stomach to see red hair spilling across my torso lily i whispered as her hand wrapped itself around me she raised her green eyes up to me hi she grinned crawling up my chest to put her lips glad you re back babe she nibbled my ear knowing just exactly how to drive me up the wall oh the things she was doing to me but hadntsirius killed me hadnthe ended all this crap god i so wish he had just ended it i gently grabbed her nape to pull her back from the sensual assault she had unleashed on my poor body lily i whispered breathless and so enchanted with this woman on top of me she read the question in my eyes years of experience making her sufficient and quick at reading me he just stunned you james the surprise i felt had flickered in my eyes because she frowned pulling back how could you think i d let him or how could your own brother kill you i frowned she right how could i ever have though she was capable of killing me or sirius and that when i noticed i alone my skin is mine i alone in here all because of lily i whispered reverently pulling her down to put my lips on hers to make our bodies and souls one yet again god peace lily she didntstop kissing me afterwards just lay down next to me kissing me whenever my reasons for this werentall carnal and out of love she told me but they were 99 9 of the reason the order needs you voldemort inside the ministry we were getting ready to use a port key when i heard whispers so clear i though someone was behind me but of course no one was in fact it seemed everyone volume was on max the 13 were awake but i wasntreassure when i looked at harry the escape was welcome but what the hell and i realized they didntknow i could hear them they didntknow i was back to normal and i wanted to keep it that way he doesntrealize he can kill voldemort oh was my own thought james arthur asked cautiously and i warned him to stay quite by putting my finger over my lips it not that hard to kill him if you have enough power and the combined power of father and son is monstrous do you realize if they ever figured out how powerful they were 10 times more powerful then riddle we d be destroyed they ve got more power then aioheal be grateful they dontknow feminine laughter echoed in my brain let keep it that way shall we holy shit holy shit and then i heard an angel voice daddy i looked around the bustling living room but nina wasntthere when i asked lily she told me nina was upstairs asleep since it was 4 a m deciding i could relay the information to dumbledore later i went upstairs opening the door to her room i saw she was sitting up tears running down her cheeks my heart shattered in my chest baby what wrong i asked leaving the door open the wedge of light showing me an upset and bereaved angel among rumpled sheets she rubbed her eyes and sniffled nestling her face in my throat as i wrapped her in my arms when nina didntspeak i prodded a little bad dream sweetheart she buried her face deeper in my throat and nodded want to tell me about it i whispered into her hair no she whispered whatever it was it cantbe hurt you nina i told her setting her down on her bed go back to sleep honey mrs weasley here if you need anything her luminous eyes bugged where are you going her voice was filled with a fear that made my gut clench to fight the bad guys i told her kissing the tip of her nose to keep you and harry safe daddy she whispered her voice quivering hmm dontgo please she asked i sighed putting my face on her shoulder that fear that pain in her voice scared and worried me so much my god i hate this war i hate all this shit going on i hate everything that keeps my family in fear that makes nina voice quiver in fear and worry god just stop this everything ll be fine baby i told her wishing i could go to sleep with her lying on my chest trusting me to keep the monsters in the closet and i wasntlying to her everything would be ok no matter the outcome but know this janina and never forget it i love you very much i love you too daddy she sniffled i kissed her cheek breathing in her sweet scent memorizing it i walked to the door and looked back at her to see her staring at me from under the covers i sighed and waved good bye it time for the big battle i told dumbledore and sirius what i had heard but when i told them my plan dumbledore was silent and sirius started yelling no james actually make that a fuck no he said vehemently you even think about risking your life i ll strangle you one possible death is better then millions of sure ones i told him calmly looking into his blue eyes knowing he would be so hurt if i died and really we dontknow for sure if i would die the 13 knowledge has become mine and i know everything they know now i learned how to tap into it but i know that if harry were to help me but if i said the incantation and there was danger of a bounce it would kill me but really no one needs to know that there another way to end this sirius insisted it ll take longer but there is another way i cantwait that long padfoot and looking at him letting all the pain flood into my eyes letting him see my nightmares my pain oh god he sighed tears flooding his eyes he suddenly found his shoes very interesting it hurt him so much that i wanted to double over with pain i walked to him and squeezed his nape putting my forehead against his if this works padfoot just think voldemort would be gone after i dontknow how many years our world will be at peace our kids will know peace i need to stop all this pain sirius mine included it just got to stop sirius lifted his eyes to me we were crying and not bother to hid it he grabbed my forearm and nodded silently we should take harry james but someone will need to guard him at all times dumbledore advised quietly sirius and i looked at him with cocked eyebrows what do you think we d be doing scratching our butts dumbledore smiled the shadow of his original grin i sorry i asked can someone stay back with nina i asked when they looked at me i just said humor me harry nearly jumped through the roof when i told him he was going with us he been waiting to sink his teeth into the battle for a long time i never wanted him to have to use the dueling skill we d taught but if we can kill voldemort now if my son and i can end all this crap and like i promised him when he was a minute old i would protect him i would die for him i pulled him aside and just hugged my son instead of protesting like most boys his age he seemed to be content with being held in my arms he put his arms around my waist his cheek over my heart when i kissed his forehead he sighed with content i pretended that nothing could touch him in the shelter of my arms that my arms were armor for my baby boy i knew i would keep the promise i made to him the day he was born i would protect him from harm today and i prayed to whoever was listening that they allow me to do just that but i didnttell him my plan didnttell him about how i d help him defeat voldemort once and for all and though he was thirsty for a chance to fight i know my son and he wouldnthave come along so willingly if he knew what i was doing so i decided to tell him during the battle where his mind would be too occupied to comprehend what i was asking of my baby boy god please protect him help me protect him lily came up to me as we were getting ready to leave be careful lily told me kissing me seconds before we touched the port key her lips vanished my demons and god her lips were heaven on earth the love i tasted on her kiss made me determined to stop all her tears she pulled back and whispered i love you against my lips she and remus would stay behind protect our daughter from everything i love you too i told and god i love her so so much god lily i sighed hugging her tightly against me i love you so much get a room sirius laughed pulling me back and towards the port key it not like you re never gonna see her again but look at the near desperation in her eyes i could tell she didntbelieve sirius either i forced myself to turn away to not run into her arms and beg her to save us to help me not let our love die with me but i didn t i ve heard that as a man around the age of 33 have feelings of impending doom they have no idea i put one arm around harry shoulder and kissed his messy hair wand in hand love at my side i was a warrior with every i ll ever need dumbledore bill and arthur weasley sirius emmelyn harry and i were the first wave the second would follow lead by kingsley and surprisingly dung i ve always loathed absolutely hated travel via port key i always get nauseous and light headed it the worst way of going into a battle in my opinion and judging by harry curses my son shares the same views years of experience helped me stay upright when we stopped but i had to grab harry before he hit the ground but he doubled over in my arms a second after he straightened up harry i asked brushing his hair back from his forehead the gesture was totally paternal but it revealed to me his raw looking scar he close by harry whispered briefly hugging me before he pulled back his hand going to rub the scar if you kill him now life will be so much easier you wonthave to watch him suffer in voldemort hands dontput yourself through watching your son suffer james the fuck off was my own thought apparently imminent death gives you an endless wall of strength and bravery because they did shut up but shit i d ve taken their bull shit any day over what we heard next ah mr potter long time no see instinctively i put harry behind me as the black figure of voldemort gained ground on us i drew out my wand as did the rest of the order and harry for once let me protect him not long enough i said watching him waiting for the wrong move that would be his final downfall a disgusting laugh resounded around the empty atrium of the ministry i tried not to think about the 4 bodies of the auror guards lying dead behind us voldemort turned his attention to dumbledore now how nice to see you again professor i apologize for not sharing the same sentiment tom dumbledore said calmly as though he were talking to snape or something and not the most vile thing on the face of the planet the sob turned his attention to harry cowering behind your father harry again i thought you might be a bit too old for that nonsense harry was defiant coming to stand next to me it his job to protect me the same laugh echoed inside the atrium after all those years he abandoned you you re still his man arentyou harry through and through my son said his voice strong his resolve a solid rock his faith in me even stronger and i prayed that i wouldntdisappoint him again dontyou recognize your own words to me james voldemort asked ha watta ya know they are my own words spoken long ago to the same piece of shit about dumbledore but i didntlet on that mr potter to you voldy how dare you he hissed raising his wand i thought quickly and built a shield around me and harry sending whatever spell he d sent our way flying across the atrium as everyone around his leapt into action spells were flying around the hall the second wave of the order doubling our power against the death eaters bodies lay everywhere death roaming among us with a frightening calm calculating choosing its next victim and for once harry stuck by me he sirius and i were in tight formation protecting each other harry you listening to me i yelled over the roar in the room yeah he said after knocking down a death eater jesus james sirius started in protest but i cut him off dontstart padfoot i warned harry listen closely when i tell you put your hands on my wand ok what he stopped to look at me nearly getting hit by a craciatus if i hadntpushed him out of the way i going to use the killing curse against him i need your help i told him drawing him away from the prying eyes and wands behind a column tears filled his eyes as realization hit the possible implications i hoped he wouldntunderstand dawning in those eyes we have to do this baby i told him gently trying to get him to understand that he wouldnthurt too much we have to end this today and now he understood and nodded but didnthave time to reply because the perfect opportunity presented itself to us only three death eaters were left fighting quickly being taken down by our people and sirius and peter were going head to head guess who was losing i really dontwant to die but the buck has to stop somewhere the suffering has to end perfect opportunity perfect timing the power surge that harry provided when i told him to grab my wand coursed through my body making the hairs at the back of my neck stand at attention at the realization that my son was incredibly powerful my body hummed as my son and i held the wand the tip exploding out a thunderbolt of the brightest most menacing green i ve see flying at my son once before i had the satisfaction of seeing voldemorts eyes before i heard harry cry out my name it felt like someone punched me in my torso or more like an 18 wheeler collided with me i felt my soul ease my mind let out a sigh a last breath as every went dark the final sounds painful to my ears as harry and sirius tried not to scream and failed sirius nina harry lily and then i was no more i opened my eyes to a glaring white light that wouldntlet me sleep in peace it took me a moment or two to realize the hum that came with the 13 had left my body another few moments i realized i was dead so there is an after life i sat up smiling when nothing was hurting or stiff i felt good dead at 33 with a wife and two kids behind maybe all the psychologists were right after all and men did develop a jesus complex at 33 but how would they get along without me how painful would it be for my family to get used to not having me around lily loved me too much for it to be an easy obstacle nina too you to fully understand why i had died and harry harry would by angry with marrow deep grief and my brothers would try to be pillars that eventually crumbled then were rebuilt by their own hands let it go james i heard someone tell me gently believe in their strength and will oh jesus oh shit this is way too weird you have your own obstacles to overcome now oh my god i wanted to yelp at least get a holy shit in but i had no breath just as well though because my throat was dry and clogged because oh shit it was my dad tall handsome and as strong as he d been when i was 10 he looked the same age as me which made the situation even more whacked out he was wearing slacks and a blue blouse he was my dad the same guy i adored tat i wanted to be like more then anything else tears filled my eyes as he strolled towards me with that knowing smile i loved so much missed so terribly oh god i couldntspeak could only sigh as tears came down my cheeks when he cupped my cheek pressing a kiss to my forehead i wept snaking my arms around his waist as he pulled me to him i never wanted to see you hear so early he murmured to me you re too young james but i didnthear him because for the first time since his death i felt safe for once i was being protected allowed to rely on somebody else let someone else carry me for once since he d died i d been a building without support columns ready to crumble any second but now i had my dad again but at what price they will move on just as you will my dad told me so strong and vital now life will go on for them and you ve eliminated the danger to the world he pulled back to stare into my eyes his brimming with tears and bursting with pride you ve done humanity more good then they ll ever know the world is safe again because of my my sweet sweet son do not regret rejoice for you will meet again yeah being dead isntas bad as you expect they let you roam around the earth whenever you feel like a stroll or you miss your family they even gave me wings to travel around faster i guess i sound a bit arrogant but ending up in heaven didntreally surprise me i deserve it for all the crap i ve been put through and heaven is heaven i tell you there never been a more breathtaking place before this and then peace inside you it heaven i met gavrael potter the 1st potter ever he was a charming scottish highlander with a thick accent and a powerful body wrapped in a kilt i was reunited with my mom and in laws who cooed endlessly of harry and nina i had several chats with dumbledore father who was exactly like his son his intelligence 5 times stronger though i was very surprised at some of the people i met friends i d lost magnificent figures that i d read about i history books and myths who were willing to talk to you for christ sake i met the spartan king leonidas walking around with his queen full of splendor and an admirable and deserved arrogance i even attended my funeral and loved sirius even more when he turned my eulogy into a comedy show he told jokes about me through watery eyes laughed at some stupid thing we d done remarking how much my parents had regretted having me when i d turned the living room sofa into an art project at age 3 padfoot moony and my lily turned my funeral from grieving for my death to celebrating my life and the idiocy that went with it padfoot talked about the first day we met how i had been when harry was born the few times we baby sat moony reminded everyone that i was probably the nicest guy ever and would never admit it he talked about how i had coaxed him out of his shell and been an inspiration and trouble maker and my wife talked about how great of a husband i was a father and friend she shared touching stories about my interaction with the kids the bond i had developed with both of them the sacrifices i had made for the world and my family i tried to comfort lily as much as i could during the terrible 1st year kissing her now and then over the years but she always thought it was a dream or a memory or even the wind brushing against her lips she was strong for her family a rock and so proud of me even as a white haired grandma she was beautiful never losing her charm adored by our grandkids worshipped by our two children i remained my robust and healthy self while she fell ill at age 83 frail but never complaining as old age wracked her body she never let on that she was suffering as i watched over her brushing her snow white hair kissing her forehead and lips half of me suffering with her while the other half rejoiced that i would be with her again soon i watched with weary amusement as harry first railed against me after my death angry at me hating me with his whole body and soul for leaving him again then i thanked god for ron and hermione when a soul wracking grief took over his emotions he graduated as head boy and captain of the quiddich team he aced like his father all his auror tests and training he married ginny weasley to my surprise and pleasure and they had twin boys and a girl i was deeply touched when he named his sons james and atticus his daughter geneva he eventually moved higher on the auror food chain apprehending potential voldemorts and still active death eaters he ended his life celebrated and loved his legacy a head of the aurors and as the boy who lived remaining in his biographical novels and through stories for generations his strength an example for the world i delighted in watching my nina grow up to be a magnificent young lady beautiful and sharp smart and talented quick on her feet as i d predicted life was good to her because she grabbed life by the balls and didntlisten to anyone but her own heart she never forgot me always seemed to force new paths drawing a strength from my memories that i never new existed she first became the head of the incantation research department a picture of me holding her had an honorary spot on her desk she then became the youngest prime minister of magic at age 45 her two daughters as proud of her as i was her husband brimming with pride i think sirius was the only one who never completely got over my death but he smiled when his own son came into the world laughed and relished every moment always ending the day wishing i d been with him still and i was though he didntknow it but a person never really leaves just goes and lives in another realm a more beautiful and peaceful one so for now good bye and never forget a person without his family is nothing a person without faith doesntlive go in peace thank you for reading and baring with me as always recommend comment and ask me questions thank you you guys rock and to quote james go in peace an when cows can fly over the moon without magic then i ll own harry potter and bring back sirius fallen with every step i fell into this odd state of sleep that night well morning i kept falling into a few minutes maybe seconds of deep sleep only to wake up not much later shift positions think about harry then fall asleep then repeat the vicious cycle then i woke up at sunrise i had forgotten to close the curtains so the sun was right in my face i cursed as it is appropriate and i had forgotten where i was so i turned to my side to see lily kiss her lips to wake her up but to my great disappointment she wasntthere then it flooded back to me the previous night and just exactly where i was i sat up in my bed i had only bothered taking off my jeans so i was in boxers and t shirt pulling the quilt to cover me from the waist down just in case and i smiled remembering the feel of harry a 5 year old harry in my arms depending on me what made the smile even broader was the fact that i had managed to keep my promise to him this time though he didntknow i know he was too young to remember me whispering reassurances to him every night before putting him to sleep but the image of his eyes chiding me that night was forever imprinted in my memory and last night when that irish bastard tried to harm him he had looked at me with the same eyes and i had been able to save him and in return i received the trust i had lost it was when lily voice floated through my head via earring i found i had tears in my throat yet again james you awake she asked softly though the excitement in her voice couldntbe missed yeah love i answered rubbing my eyes good morning truly is c mon get out of bed then i in arbellas living room she squealed excitedly i frowned though she couldntsee it why petunia and her family are going somewhere and wontbe back until night time the pigs dontthink harry worth bringing along we both cursed so he spending the day with arbella ha i laughed i dontthink he enjoys being locked up what are you saying my love she asked i could hear her beautiful smile i got out of bed and began to change my clothes yes ladies even my boxers as i talked to her i wanna take harry out to the park or something dumbledore may kill us sweetheart she said cautiously though it didnthave the convincing lily tone she always used when it came to me breaking the rules and she following them i think sometimes when she tells me not to do something she just does it out duty she a marauder at heart eh best way to go really i said buttoning my jeans true she smiled c mon hurry down stairs i miss you yeah ey you still have to tell me about your time with harry you were there with mine i smiled it was then that i noticed i had my accent back i laughed to myself not telling lily of this new discovery as i brushed my hair since i used to either long hair or really messy untamable hair having sleek shiny velvety short hair is kinda new then i looked in the mirror for a second and then ruffled my hair again like mine when i was younger and harry s better i muttered come on she yelled i winced you shout again lily and i swear on the pain of death i ll strangle you go to hell right i said and headed downstairs i heard some voices in the hall once belonged to petunia the other to my host good morning i smiled trotting down the stairs looking at harry and the cat hiding behind petunia the women both turned to face me arbella smiled pleasantly wearing a hideous bathrobe with her hair in curls under a net and petunia with a grimace wearing a tanned overcoat weather report must ve reported cold temperatures because harry to my delight was wearing my sweatshirt a fact i immediately notified lily of he slept in it too she giggled oh god james it like i have you both back again nice morning isntit i asked leaning against the banister a few steps from the ground her words had hit me full force both back i never went anywhere babe i told lily can we talk about this later she pleaded i swear when we get home you and i will spend days talking about this i said turning to the ladies it is quite lovely though the weather is very unlikely for june arbella said arentyou the man who brought harry home yesterday petunia asked eyeing me suspiciously looking me up and down with a curious eye ew james my sister has the hotts for you lily sniggered i ignored her comment but tilted my head from the stairs to get a better look of harry behind his hideous aunt morning harry morning he smiled shyly a subject both sirius and i had discussed for an hour planning on somehow de shy ifying him when we got him back sleep well i asked with a smile he nodded glad to hear it i said winking at him throwing petunia into a tantrum of looking like a fish i didntknow you were a friend of mrs figgs she said at last not finding a way to nag at me for being nice to harry oh he is a dear friend well his mother was arbella said noticing that she looked much too old to be my friend how nice petunia said still looking at me in disbelief i flashed her a winning smile it is i love coming to england on vacation visiting arbella i smiled always nice and cozy she looked at me of course sir this is the safest neighborhood in the whole of surrey i shook my head wanting to pounce on her knock her to the ground and tell her that my son my flesh and blood had been in danger last night in her safe neighborhood so i pointed a long finger at harry he nearly got killed in this safe neighborhood of yours mrs dursley so i d forget about that arbella eyes widened he nearly what i shook my head long story arbella but to give you the essence he was sent out of the house alone at 10 at night because his uncle did you say uncle harry i asked him he nodded looking nervous had gotten mad at him i finished i knew the dursley had tried establishing themselves as a respectable family but my saying that and to be called irresponsible in front of a respectable neighbor was uncalled for to them to me and lils it was their do come now mr evens was it surely you cantbelieve that that lie from this child do you keep your temper lily said dontmake me take off the goddamn earring i hissed then why pry tell mrs dursley did a 5 year old boy who seems intelligent in his own right was walking down the streets of the neighborhood in dead of night she looked at me in a horrified expression and i knew anger had taken over my face i felt my face heat up my fists curling in balls at my side as i watched that whore look like a fish when she spoke she sounded hoarse he had snuck out please mrs dursley dontlet me lose a complete grip on my temper i said neither of us would enjoy that my husband is waiting for me outside i should get going she breathed not looking at me thank you again arbella no problem she smiled nervously having heard the sparks go off from my wand upstairs petunia glanced at me then rushed out of the door and would ve collided with harry if my son hadntgotten out of the way harry eyes were wide i think he was surprised that i had gotten mad for him and i felt proud that i had protected him kept my promise come on in harry we ll get some breakfast arbella smiled extending her hand towards him with a kind smile i was walking down the stairs when it happened i missed the next step and feel on my butt in front of harry shit i muttered causing both my wife and arbella to shout at me between screams of laughter accompanied by harry are you ok he asked between giggles i rubbed my aching butt i should be watch out next time atticus arbella smiled i ran a hand through my hair and smiled gleefully when i saw harry offer me a hand i took it with a smile looking into his green eyes thanks i smiled and grunting heaved myself off the ground you are such a dolt lily said i glared at the cat harry and i went into the kitchen harry and arbella still laughing as we sat down harry next to me to my chaotic delight there you go smiled arbella putting two bowls of gray slop in front of us i shot a glance at my flesh and blood who looked back at me with a smile and a shrug uh arbella do you have something like peanut butter and jelly dontyou like porridge she asked as lily the cut jumped on harry lap he smiled down at her stroking her ginger hair not particularly no i answered what about you harry she asked um i dontlike it either he said quietly i extended a hand and scratched the cat behind her ears lily purred for me oh james she moaned we re a family again in some odd ways i laughed then turned my attention to making harry a sandwich he smiled as i gave it to him thank you he smiled as arbella put a cup of milk in front of me i recommend you de catify his milk i told lily i donthave my wand get his attention away from it she said so harry i said you want to got the park later um sure he nodded with a joyful smile out of the corner of my eye i saw the milk in his glass magically refill as if some invisible carton of milk was being dumped into his glass in the hand of a caring mother good maybe we get some ice cream later his smile broadened ok he nodded good i smiled very good he didnttalk much but quietly munched away at his sandwich and sipped his milk when i asked him something he replied with a short answer when i tried to make him smile he giggled softly and didntlook at me to my great disappointment i asked whether his sweatshirt was comfortable he finally looked at me and smiled i need to go to the store for a moment will you boys be alright arbella asked after we had helped her clean the table we re gonna have a little fun of our own i smiled arbella beamed at me bye then she smiled and headed outside k harry you wanna go now or later i asked look at him he shrugged shyly take him now i ll be with you in a few minutes lily said why i asked frowning at the cat when he looked away i cantstay cat any longer she said and the cat trotted outside alright i said slightly confused and then turned to harry you wanna go he nodded with a beautiful smile jumping off the stool and all i could think was that i had him back in some form my own flesh and blood and my creation and he had me back in some twisted way as well you have to lead the way harry i dontknow where the park is i said alright he smiled where prongs i jumped at my nickname 5 years ago he had pronounced it so weakly as pongs much to sirius amusement since padfoot was pronounced right by his godson a thought struck probably with the other cats i need to get my coat from upstairs wait for me he nodded right i said and carefully running up the stairs i went to my room siri i said looking into the mirror but he wasntthere padfoot i hissed yeah he asked groggily running his hand through his hair i got an idea i beamed another first he smiled shut up all you need to do is keep silent for you an impossible task in it self sirius beamed at me i ll be quiet in 10 minutes i was running down the stairs wearing a navy blue jacket with a pair of dark stylish sunglasses on my eyes sorry i kept you waiting harry couldntfind my jacket he squirmed uncomfortably c mon let go i said with him leading the way harry and i went to the park i kept trying to make him laugh but he only smiled and looked uncomfortable so i shut up praying for lily to return from wherever she had disappeared i was making him nervous for some reason he looked uncomfortable it was only when we got to the sandboxes and settled down when i spoke what wrong harry he looked at me a bit puzzled you look erm out of it i felt like i was intruding in on him true i was his father but still he didntknow whom i really was and had only known atticus for less then a day at first he denied it but his eyes adapted the same look of surrender that lily got when she thought i was hopeless it just i i i don know what a dad feels like but i uh feel close to you i smiled you wanna know what a dad like harry smiled shyly casting his eyes down come here i said he slowly walked towards me his feet sinking in the soft playing sand i turned him around and he sat down in my lap i wrapped my arms around him his back against me you re supposed to feel safe protected hyper with your dad you feel like like you can laugh with him cry with him and can confide in him he settled back against me and tears welled up in my eyes as his head lolled on my shoulder i stopped caring about everything voldermort dumbledore a wizards promise as i transformed my face back into james potter and planted a kiss in his hair so identical to mine you feel like that he said softly you feel like a son to me too harry i said trying to contain my voice from breaking as tears dribbled down my face how do you know how a son feels he asked and if felt like a dad answering his curios son questions i swallowed i had a boy what happened to him harry asked um mean men ripped him away from me i said sighing so that his head rose slightly i sorry he said as though he knew who i was what happened on halloween i squeezed him closer if possible you had nothing to do with it atticus i heard someone call i froze and quickly changed back when harry turned to face me as i hastily brushed off my tears long time no see boy tall blonde well equipped women smiled standing outside the sandbox eh i asked it me lily squeaked in my ear i lost my color as i caught her eyes do i know you i asked with a smile harriet jameson she smiled having acted so impenetrable to pain for so long it was easy for lily and i to pretend we were old friends when lily hugged me she whispered why are you crying we just had a talk no he doesntknow me i told her she kissed my cheek as she pulled back from my arms um harriet this is harry i said finally understanding where she had gotten her name from she knelt in front of our son the boy she spend 18 hours giving birth too and yelling at me in st mungos hi she smiled as i watched harry smile shyly at her that afternoon the three of us were a family lily and i were young parents playing with their baby boy and no one else knew that he laughed he played he looked happy and it ripped me to pieces the cruelty the injustice of the fact that harry couldntsee his beautiful mother who was running around with me after harry like parents of a 5 year old it ripped my heart to pieces that he didntknow when i took the two for ice cream i ran off to the bathroom after we ordered massive extravagant bowls of ice cream that promise to be delicious in the bathroom i magically sealed the door with the wand i was carrying in my jacket i took off my shades and looked into them as i ran a hand over them so it transformed into my old mirror sirius smiling face appeared i love ya mate he smiled looking 20 years younger to my immense and wondrous joy i laughed what do you think of him exact replica of you and i see what you mean about that shy business he said thoughtfully when you get out and we get him back god willing you and i will spend our days de shyifying him you called it i smiled he nodded with a bark like laughter thanks for letting me see him prongsie wasntanything i assured him i think i need to take him back to arbella s the dursleys might be home soon padfoot nodded right he smiled you really are his father you know that i mean he doesntknow it but watching you with him james you look like father and son even with your visage i smiled at him beamed actually thanks sirius i said and he disappeared placing the wand back in my pocket i was getting ready to walk out of the bathroom where i dissaparated i cantreally say it was accident because i dontknow what to call it one minute i was standing in a muggle bathroom of ice cream shop the next i was in the three broomsticks in hogsmade facing dumbledore dontyou hear the dun dun dun in the background kids what in hell i questioned sorry if i startled you ol boy he smiled kindly his eyes sparkling but i needed to speak with you what wrong i asked him realizing i was in the privet chambers of the broomsticks i must ask you and lily to cut your visit short you may be putting him in danger dumbledore explained my head exploded so did the tip of my wand what i sorry he nodded i frowned at him god you just couldntlet us have one week with him could you two days seems sensible and enough time to reconnect with your son he said calmly i wanted to choke the old bastard yeah he doesnteven know it me he thinks i a friend of arbella figg who happened to feel like a father he hung his head i sorry yeah yeah i sighed but james i ve been watching in my own ways and i must say having someone constant someone who he trusts and knows and cares about in his life might make it easier for him he said eh keep atticus in his life pay him a visit each year or two and spend some time with him he smiled i beamed but still i had to leave my baby boy for the second time and with a heavy heart i apparated back to the bathroom and walked towards my wife and son who were busy laughing at something j atticus lily smiled there jatticus again where were you i er needed to make a call i smiled sliding in the booth opposite harry and lily she frowned everything all right she asked i shifted my focus on my son i have to go home tonight his eyes enlarged they need me at work i finished weakly i slid over to harry leaning closer to him across the table but i promise you this harry i ll visit arbella more often and when i do i will be sure to pick you up and we ll go have fun together alright he nodded with a long face i lifted his chin to with my thumb and finger c mon gimme that beautiful smile of yours harry i said fighting tears as lily hand moved behind his back to rub it soothingly there is no need for a long face so long as i am me i alive and healthy you will see me often the sides of his mouth twitched promise he asked of course i smiled and be sure sweetheart atticus never breaks a promise

enjoy hbp and this chapter and read my short the trouble of sick animagi ch 6 these colors that you shine when we got back from our trip for some odd reason lily and i ran to different rooms in the house and avoided each other for the rest of the day i went into the extra room in the house a room only the two of us saw and knew of that we used as a library the amount of books challenged that of hogwarts as did it size it the equal to the american library of congress however i closed the door behind me upon making sure that the lights were on in the room i turned around and faced the library that had sort of become a living room for us on the couch before the fireplace was an empty bottle of wine my wife and i had shared and somehow i lost it i dontknow what happened but in a flash the bottle was in my hand and i hurled it like a pro baseball player at the wall why me i bellowed six years worth of anger and fright channeling themselves through me in the form of unbelievable fiendish anger i never knew i possessed i threw up my hands and let out a yell the world would ve heard if there wasnta charm around the room six years worth of so much pain so much anger and confessions mounted up summed up the minute i had to say goodbye to him for the second time in a lifetime first i found out about the prophecy then i had to leave my family for large amounts of time to carry out missions for the order only to go into hiding upon my return then have my son my two best friends who passed for brothers and peace and sanity be ripped away from me with such force my head spun i had my life burned down to a cinder in one minute i lost everything including myself i lost i confused i hurting so bad i cantfeel anymore i dontknow what to do how to deal what to say and what not to say to lily who hurt as much as i did i nearly ripped out my hair when i remembered him asking what a dad felt like put a bullet through my head please because i cantthink i dontwant to think because i ll lose it completely and because it hurt so bad i had held him first in st mungos two minutes after he arrived in my life i had held him close and carefully as his godparents danced around him i remember kissing his forehead as he nestled closer to me and i vowed i would love him till the day i died i would be there for him always and protect him against all evil all hell i kept only one promise if even that i love my son he will be the first thing on my mind every morning and the last every night i know my son name will be the last on my lips before i die but he didntknow that i haventkept the other two promises i haventbeen there for him and i haventprotected him against all evil and i saw his eyes on the wall asking me to protect him keep him safe from all the evil things in the world it was when i had taken to pounding my fist into the wall when lily ran in she yelped my name and ran towards me grabbing my fist and turning me so i was in her arms why are you doing this she whispered my fist still in her hand i burned my head in her red hair i wanna die i whispered as her hands rubbed circles on my back no you don t she said firmly but i do i donthave anything left now do i they ve taken my son from me my best friends my life my peace my sanity and day and day you slip away from me i always here james she said i ll always be here you ll be here for a great shag a kiss and a hug but you re slipping away from me we re falling apart i said as a hammer pur ed the remaining pieces of my heart how can you say that to me james to me when our bond has never been stronger and my love for you never greater she whispered i dontknow lily i cried i just losing my sanity i i cantdeal anymore i felt her hand in my hair stroking it gently sweetheart i know it hurts i know the pain i howled my knees buckling so i was on my knees i cantdeal anymore i whimpered as she took me in her arms rocking me back in forth you can you re strong james donttear yourself apart for things you cantcontrol she said kissing the side of my head i looked into her eyes but i could have prevented this james no listen if i hadntallowed sirius to switch with peter then everyone would ve been fine i cried my heart gone as i grew numb i could ve stopped this from happening to us g every time i look into your eyes i i see my mistakes i see my cowardice i could ve protected you it was my duty but i trusted peter i misjudged i responsible her furrowed brow and clouded eyes surprised me as i saw anger you are too confused to see the obvious james up to this very moment you never failed me or harry or sirius up to this second i pulled back and sat on my knees angry at her now why because i hurting because i too fed up to keep a cool exterior because for once you have to help me i smelled the air and it was the calm before one hell of a storm as hurricane lily and james crashed in their biggest fight yet because you admitted defeat because you re so caught up in yourself pity you re taking the blame that how you failed your son james you re feeling sorry for yourself i stood up i feel sorry for myself then why in hell donti give a crap about how much i miss my son then how much you do if i so damn selfish then why do i want to blow my head off every morning when i remember you wonthug harry forget about me i have had it i yelled not really noticing lily tears and the show of emotions in her eyes i dontwant to see you in pain because of something i couldntprotect you from i the father damn it i the husband and i supposed makes sure you two are fine is that what bothering you i looked at her like i would at sirius after he pointed out the obvious no shit she frowned the james i know would ve seen the truth which is you are protecting us you have protected us if i remember correctly you told me to run upstairs with harry and go to hogwarts while you held over voldemort that night sweetheart that was suicide but you risked your life to save ours the james potter i adore would know that there are more then one way to protect your family i walked away from her i dontknow him anymore lost contact about five years ago oh what happened to him he grew up found out just how na ve he was i sighed found out nothing is fair that life sucks and you cantmake the best of the lot you cast without stumbling miserably here and there there was a small period of thundering silence then she whispered where is he now he swallowed up by by everything all that he put behind him is coming back and biting him on the ass i said just as quietly he regretting i turned to her he regretting that he yelled at his wife that he doubted her she made her way towards me i understand perfectly love you have never ever shown me any weakness when it came to this save the first day i was wondering when the volcano would erupt i cry all the time james yes but your heart is the one in the slaughter house you lost more then i did lily she stopped me you lost a best friend two whom i got to really know when you were celebrating 10 years of friendship with them they meant mean way more to you and harry was to you then me dontsay that i threatened she smiled but it true and i dontreally mind in our sons many confession to me as mr whiskers he told me that although he was only one when his parents died he still has dreams about a tall man messy black hair midnight blue eyes who always smiled she cupped my cheek wiping away a tear i didntknow i had he said he remembers the man always watching out for him he remembers me i chocked out my world reeling lily beamed yea her eyes grew soft you want to again tell me how you failed your son i felt foolish i guess i must have had impact on harry to be remembered by him but i was still helpless his eyes followed me again but i swallowed through it i needed to regain control i sorry lils i shouldnthave flipped out like that she kissed me no problem after all the best part of fighting is making up i kissed her forehead later i have some thinking to do she twined her arms around my shoulders looking me straight in the eyes tonight 11 o clock our room the massive bed i ll be the one with the g string only i hooted it a date k she smiled and walked out of the room leaving me standing rooted to the spot amazed at how well this women handled me and just how stupid i really was what gave me the right to yell at her what made me think it was my fault after 5 years of convincing myself it was only peter and voldemorts not mine not sirius s not harry but peter and voldies i think it was ten minutes after she left that i breathed i walked towards of the bookcases i knew to contain the photo albums that we had recovered from the hollow and sirius place i pulled out the one with that was from harry birth to his baptism and everything his parents and godparents thought was cute or remotely important i went towards the couch and plopped down on it sort of bewildered by how calm i felt i randomly opened a page in the thick album and came across pictures kat remus fianc and remus had taken in st mungo on harry birth i started laughing when i remembered that blessed day lily had woken up a few hours before sunrise claiming her stomach was hurting of course i panicked when i timed her and my lily was about to have our baby we went via port key and i mirrored sirius who cussed me out for waking him up then thanked when he heard why i had interrupted his beauty sleep she was admitted in st mungos in a single room james i heard sirius voice yell from down the corridor lily piper had yelled after him as i heard running footsteps lily looked at me are you sure our son will be safe with the godparents we chose i mean they re kinda crazy she asked having just calmed down after a contraction i laughed he will be more then safe babe i said kissing her forehead just look at it this way he will have more love is he or she here yet sirius asked panting from the doorway does it look like it you dolt lily growled pardon sirius lils he still asleep piper smiled walking towards her best friend and taking her hand a healer wearing a blue coat with fishes swimming across it came to the room glaring were you two making all that noise she asked her beady eyes looking at piper and sirius er no it was a uh she looked at us for help a crazed werewolf with multiple personalities i finished for her lily and james i smiled as sirius started coughing his trademark for when he wanted to hide his laughter the healer looked unconvinced aha she said and with a sigh walked out of the room nice cover james piper smiled thank you i bowed by the way did you remember to tell our crazed multiple personalitied werewolves that i here lily asked shaking her head as sirius high fived me for the cover sirius looked dumb struck oh no piper grumbled you forgot moony and kat oh shit he moaned you are an ass i said discretely he started to laugh just yankin your antlers prongs i flooed him why what why did i ever become friends with you i asked him he shrugged flipping his long hair he said because i beautiful piper and lily snorted oh god lily whimpered her hand suddenly clamping painfully tight on mine i ll be outside sirius nodded and slipped out as lily writhed in pain piper and i crooning words of encouragement in her ear until she breathed normally two hours later i was in the hall with sirius and now remus i was dozing off having been assured we would be there for a few hours and piper was with her my head was against sirius shoulder as we sat on the chairs and our crazed werewolf sat against the opposite wall on the ground where did you say kat was again asked sirius waking me up meeting he trailed off and we knew what meeting kat or katherine was sent to voldemort as one of the werewolves that joined the dark side she bore the mark but worked as a spy for our side i remember a conversation with remus where he told me just how worried he was for his lady love she ok moony i assured him when i noticed the worried look on his face she can take care of herself yeah sirius agreed my head still on his shoulder he gave us a weak smile c mon moony where that crazed multiple personalitied werewolf smile we love sirius asked ha he asked so you werentlying yelped the healer coming out of lily room oh shit we both said jumping up as she took out her wand we screamed slightly when she used a spell all aurors know forcing someone to walk somewhere like two big guys were dragging them sirius and i ran towards the healer you dontunderstand padfoot began yeah remus is is normal we were just joking i cried remus too stunned to speak it took us two hours to get remus off the hook then he chased us around the hospital until he got his revenge then we were again sitting in the hall except remus was where sirius was so my head was on his shoulder hey guys am i late we heard kat call remus stood up without warning so my head fell hard against the chair no i said sitting up rubbing my head healer said we re here for quite a stretch how is everything sirius asked pointedly she looked at him from remus grip and nodded saw regulus he gave a weak smile five hours later we were pacing up and down the corridor now joined by peter sirius and i were jumping up and down trying to stay awake that was now a picture in the album god almighty is it supposed to take this long remus asked i shrugged still bouncing what do you expect it the son of the all time lazy person jimmy potter sirius smiled your godson too i said as we jumped he beamed two hours later i was with lily during a particularly painful contraction where i actually feared my fingers falling off you and i are over buddy from now on you ll sleep on the couch you did this to me she roared sweetheart i said remembering my dad warning about women in labor sex is over she declared and suddenly looked calm and let go of my hand dropping back against the pillow mortified i walked back into the hall scratching my head and found my friends doubled over laughing 7 hours later i was in the room with lily and three healers as she finally gave birth to our son i was terrified amazed and proud as she screamed in pain and at last one more push and harry was born of course we didntknow we would name him that as they took harry to clean him or whatever and after giving her a kiss i ran outside to the eager friends it a boy i yelled and literally jumped on sirius as everyone said congratulations when i went back into the room the red faced baby was wrapped in a blue blanked and the healer gave him to me hey kiddo i had smiled as he snuggled closer to me i your dad i informed him promising him everything i walked over to my wife the beautiful mother who was truly glowing and this beautiful women is your mom i told him giving him to her my baby she cried as he settled against her breast he was perfect black hair his eyes were slightly open to reveal brilliant green eyes and he was beautiful i caught a fat tear coming down from her cheek my love through all this you did not cry do not now of all times she looked at me with a glowing face same goes for you she smiled i chuckled tracing harry soft hand he perfect i told her like his father she smiled no no like his mom i told her mr potter mrs potter the same healer who had delivered harry and had taken remus as a temporary prisoner what is his name gonna be i looked at harry whose eyes were slowly beginning to fully open you still wanna name him daniel she shook her head william she shook her head paul she shook her head again i scratched my head rupert same answer gregory same answer albus she laughed harry i asked almost jokingly she beamed at me her eyes glowing my eyebrows disappeared in my hair harry really she nodded i kissed her cheek then harry hand harry paul potter i welcome you to the world i smiled james ha no i mean harry james potter not paul she said i thought you wanted to name him after your dad i said frowning lily shook her head he never gonna know his grandfather so what the use his father is more important to both of us i beamed ok then harry james potter my one and only son i welcome you to the world i said and he made a movement as though he smiled hey he likes it i laughed and kissed his head c mon stop stuffing the poor fellow give him some room sirius said as the door opened let his surrogate family have a look at him dolt i said and stepped away from lily here james lily said and indicated that i take harry and i did gladly oh my god they cooed as they surrounded my son and i kids meet my kid harry i smiled harry these are the people that will be in every single second moment of your life dontterrify the poor kid kat smiled standing at his head her arm through remus s oh sirius this is our godson piper smiled clinging on to sirius i looked up into my best friend eyes and i saw an expression i had never seen in his eyes before he was sincere he was calm he was serious and a glint in his eyes appeared and i noticed the same glint in my eyes and i knew if something every happened to me with lily there or not sirius would make me proud and raise my son as though he was his own and i loved him for that in response to his girlfriends statement he grunted he so small peter the stupid rat had said i know it amazing there actually someone smaller then you pete remus smiled tapping him on the back i wasntpaying attention to them i was still staring at sirius then turned my attention to my baby boy harry i want you to meet a very important man to both of us your godfather and i gave him to sirius who looked startled as a fat tear dropped from his eyes looking down at harry my baby boy all grown up sirius smiled looking at me as i noticed harry looked particularly comfortable in his arms i laughed knowing he meant me a soft knock at the door drew our attention safe to come in i saw my dad head ask i laughed as i saw him having missed the man after 3 months of no face to face contact he d been in danger from the dark side and was in hiding since my mom was killed two years before with lily dad yeah dad i smiled at him he came in followed by lily mother my dad hugged me slapping me on the back played with harry for a minute teasing sirius by asking when he would have a kid then went to his precious daughter in law as piper remus and kat danced manically around harry my mother in law hugged me next then went to her daughter that day was so important to all of us and we had no idea that half of the things we said promised harry and each other would never be kept because we were going to be separated by war and murder before i realized it it was 11 o clock and i was in the library aged 50 years lost energy hope and happiness and i went to my bedroom to lily as promised an i love you amber sorry had to say that everybody cheers for the editor um yeah i have this idea for the next chapter that i have to go

the enthusiasm really got my mind working i needed the boost thank you high low i know it sad my speciality hahaha milathequeen who said sirius would ever die in this story eh jk i have everything planned so yeah hehe disclaimer would i be rushing out to buy hbp if i owned these dudes no ch 7 the soul you adore three months after that horrible face off with my wife i honestly saw what she had meant when she said our bond hadntbeen stronger ever i felt closer to her closer then ever and felt she understood me more and vice versa a calm had settled into me after that horrid night in the library and i could deal with everything now especially since we started to make discoveries about dementors for sirius break out but still we didntknow how to get him out of there but we didntgive up not like i had that night but still i kept going back to precious memories such as harry birth and i disappeared in my realm of thought even when i restarted teaching at the local jr high school had restarted again and i was with my last class of the day at the school in the scorching hot sun of autumn in turlock we were on the blacktop or basketball courts by the road as i taught my young students how to shoot a bow and arrow apparently knowing how to use a deadly weapon is a muggle requirement in pe ok guys you know the rules everyone behind the white markers no one makes a move until i say clear i said walking behind a group of girls so i was out of the line of fire the girls looked at me and giggled making me recall kat lily and piper every time they saw sirius remus and i walking by alright and i blew my whistle i was walking up and down the line as each student took his or her turn shooting the arrow my eyes caught a tall women with red streaks in her jet black hair with the leash of her dog in her hand she wore thick 70 style sun glasses with a cap that sat backwards on her head she looked vaguely familiar and the person i was associating her with was long dead to my great disappointment she looked in my direction then quickly turned her head back as i tried to place her make sense of her familiarity the women crossed the street which was dangerous with oncoming traffic from both sides as her dog rather black and large like sirius animagus form though smaller trotted in front of her i frowned i dismissed my class and headed back behind them with the equipment as usual resisting the temptation to levitate the equipment back instead of carrying it hey mr pierce one of my robust arrogant male students called waving towards me i nodded towards him hey tyler what up i asked with a smile is it true you ll be the coach for the football team this season he asked exuberantly i welsh football doesntsit as well with me as soccer what we call football since we use the foot and rugby but i had to pretend i loved it since i was american and manly man american love that vulgar game of football so i was forced to love it yeah i nodded having agreed to be the coach at gunpoint from the principle cool he yelled making me wince that night i sat at the large dinner table while lily shuffled around in the kitchen having proved to be a better cook with no magic i was slumped over books about dark creatures trying to get any piece of information about dementors and how to escape them a thought struck me what if someone had written a book called everything you need to know about dementors and how to escape them when no one else ever has rather long title but you dontknow how useful it would be if it existed by some miracle what eating you up lily asked standing with her hand on her hip as she mixed something in the pot over the stove huh i asked the woman i had seen on the sidewalk that morning had been on my mind all day i was hopelessly trying to place her and i told lily that she frowned you think she a witch lily asked walking to the table and standing across from me putting her hand on chair opposite me i shrugged i dontknow but she looked familiar if you think she recognized you sweetheart we need to tell dumbledore lily said sounding slightly worried her eyes confirming the emotion i dontknow i may have been hallucinating i shrugged stupid sun she chuckled lightly why do you think you re hallucinating i looked at her wondering if she would think me insane if i told her but as i looked into those emerald jewels i knew better well she looked like piper i said scratching my head my hair short again at lily insistence her eyes grew a few sizes then frowned piper as in sirius fianc your cousin and my best friend she asked all three pipers yeah i smiled you guys of course know piper had been padfoot girl since school and lily best friend what you didntknow is that piper was a blood relative a few months younger then me though i called her my baby cousin she was a potter the number one reason sirius mother so fiercely objected to their union my aunt and uncle werentthat thrilled either after all he is a black sweetie it been 6 years since since yeah she finished i smiled as my mind took me to another time to another time when the news of piper disappearance reached us it was late at night maybe 4 or 5 lily harry and i were sound asleep in our house at the hollow hey james i heard someone call in a whisper i opened my eyes looking around the room reaching for my wand a lily whose head rested on my chest made a disgruntled noise at my movement prongs the voice said and i knew it was sirius cautiously unwinding her arms from my waist i took the mirror out of my drawer and snuck downstairs turning on the kitchen light and putting on my glasses sirius face became clearer in the mirror but his gray eyes were dull as red rimmed the sides my heart clenched what wrong what happened piper he croaked out his throat sounded dry shit what happened my heart dropping leagues down into my stomach as another portion traveled to my throat um just high tail it over here he said and he disappeared i took the stairs in twos sometimes threes i threw on a shirt not bothering with jeans i gently woke up lily told her i needed to go to sirius flat and didntanswer when she asked why after a kiss i dissaparated to his pad i was slightly shocked to see the studio like apartment fully lit and quickly found sirius on his leather couch he looked up at me with the same eyes he would later acquire in azkaban what happened i asked for the third time that night dumbledore just flooed uh he swallowed as i sat down next to him you know he put that tracking thing on her wand i nodded i had been an auror and a member of the order for too long not to know what that meant it suddenly dropped radar he said tears rolling down he hasntbeen able to track her since i talked to her three days ago no i moaned oh god prongs she dead he said his shoulder trembling as his lip quivered along with his voice and he threw himself in my arms i wrapped my arms around him just as he had done to me when my mother was killed i held him as he grabbed at my shoulder and shirt i didntmind too numb to notice anything my favorite cousin my best friend piper was his best friend maybe change it to my good friend or my friend was probably dead i shuttered at the thought of her mangled body lying somewhere in a ditch she dead he whimpered shaking harder you dontknow that i assured him she may have just snapped her wand or or the tracker had a limit no i feel it he said a piece of me just ripped out i never gonna for the sake of the remaining pieces of both our sanity dontfinish that sentence i told him i heard two pops and remus and kat appeared both white remus swallowed as he looked at the trembling sirius in my arms with mechanical steps he came forward sitting behind him squeezing his shoulder as he bowed his head kat didntseem to be able to move at all i dontwhether it was because of the shock of piper disappearance or her usually strong friend who never showed weakness was now at his worst all that came out of her was a whisper sirius lily with harry sleeping in his carrier arrived via port key tears running down her eyes carefully setting down our son she walked towards us kneeling in front of sirius she pushed a strand of hair behind his ear as he buried his face deeper into my shoulder peter appeared later and stood far from the group as we comforted him the best way we could but i wasntthe only one who noticed one of our vital forces missing from the group first time in 15 years we werenttogether sweetheart presently lily said softly and i turned my attention to the present what did you remember the night we found out about piper i answered you mean when you roared that every death eater including voldemort should cower in a hole somewhere because you d go after them all of em and you swore it even though it would take a lifetime but you d gut them cut them limb from limb and call the blunt work blessed she asked i smiled sheepishly at my very vengeful idea i was kind of proud of it yeah i said you always were over protective of all of us she smiled going back to the kitchen especially of piper she was my baby cousin ya know i said closing the large book in front of me i felt it was my job to protect her lily laughed is that why you introduced the poor girl to sirius sirius never loved anyone as he did piper she was perfectly safe with that maniac i pointed out yeah lily vibrant eyes suddenly went dim like someone had turned off her eyes it nearly destroyed sirius when she disappeared nearly i asked you dontremember how he was 2 a m drink binges crying he didntsay more then two sentences i said and the memory of the weeks that followed flooded me for our own sanity and sirius s remus and i didntleave him alone for one second during the next two weeks after her disappearance i practically moved back in with him the first few days until we convinced him to stay at my house he was very calm around harry played with him with a mirthless smile on his lips which was a very important conquest since none of us except harry could get even a smile he didntshow his colors around lily either but she knew she heard remus and i really saw our best friend fall into pieces and i think i saw more one night he and i were downstairs in the kitchen i had made sure lily and harry were asleep harry had taken my side of course sirius and i having become insomniacs were sitting on the stools by the kitchen island in silence we hadntsaid anything for a few hours now drank our fire whiskey she was pregnant he suddenly said making me spit out the drink what i asked looking at him he looked back at me with those eyes she was pregnant prongs she was carrying my child he tried to laugh but tears rolled down i was gonna be a dad how long i asked putting my hand on his shoulder three and a half months he said quietly a girl you dontknow how happy i was at the prospect of being a dad having that same glazed over dumb founded look on your face thrilled me she was afraid that i wouldntwant to have a baby since i lived life on the fast broom she was actually scared told me she had already thought about giving her up for adoption by now we both were staring into our drunks tears rolling down my throat was too dry for me to talk so i let him go on but for two months all i could do was plan i was gonna be a dad i saw her growing up side by side with harry you and lily would be her godparents she d be best friends with harry you and i would teach them the ways of the marauders once they were in school we would both be a dad teaching them quiddich i thought of all that even her name i smiled at the idea that was plausible no longer what name rose or emlyn emlyn more than likely it means noble warrior he answered nodding i was gonna teach her everything and die with piper at my side and now now he chocked shacking with his hands covering his face jesus sirius i said hugging him again finally understanding exactly how he felt i so sorry i said to him i so sorry padfoot i didntknow james why are you crying lily voice interrupted i realized she was standing right next to me her hand in my hair ha oh nothing just remembered the night he told me about piper pregnancy he was so broken i croaked out he had a special bond with kids even with dudley she said resting my head against her stomach yeah i breathed the next day was saturday and i had to mow the lawn also known as the party on crowell rd lily and i hadntslept at all we were tossing about in the bed my mind filed with sirius he loved her so much so unbelievably much breakfast had been a silent affair coffee and a sandwich was all i ate my stomach couldnthandle more i went outside with the machine wearing only jeans as the neighbors came out lily was talking to a few of the women in the neighborhood i joined her when i finished wrapping my arm around her waist after pulling on a white t shirt the three ladies were teasing me about being the new football coach when i spotted the same women walking towards me this time no glasses my heart stopped i was walking towards her i didntknow it i was sure i was hallucinating or life was going my way the women looked at me james she whispered when i was a few inches from her i swallowed piper i asked she nodded of f she said tears streaming down her face i thought i put my hand over her mouth and ragged her into the house before she spoke another word saw lily follow and closed the door standing behind me in the living room where i had let her go is it really you piper i asked her she was in tears yea it me she said chuckling ask me anything alright when did grandpa teach us to fly i asked knowing the real piper would know grandpa jake taught us when we were 10 but that was what we told our moms we were only five she smiled i laughed as she threw herself in my arms i thought you were dead same goes for you pipe i told her hoping i was awake that i wasntdreaming hoping and praying that she my baby cousin really was in my arms that she was really alive crying in my chest what how what happened that night i thought voldemort killed you s sirius betrayed you she cried no he didn t you explain first alright she nodded pulling back and looking up at me then towards lily piper took her hand i was um kidnapped death eaters they kept me 5 months till voldemort disappeared because of my godson she smiled slightly when i came too in st mungos i had no one left she looked into my eyes or i thought sirius was azkaban he he was someone i didntknow you and lily were dead i had no one nothing left remus doesnteven know i alive so i went into this sort of exile only dumbledore knows i alive why exile lily whispered people dontgenerally like to sit next to the girlfriend of a mass murderer slash traitor on the knight bus no one was gonna take me back in she said bitterly i was surprised that dumbledore did but somehow i think there more to the story and who d help if they ever found out i was pregnant the baby what happened to her i asked urgently she chuckled lightly she was strong like her father made it out alive from the death eaters grip but died when she was 4 she was sick tears welled up in her eyes a stream came down from her familiar eyes you should ve seen her james she looked exactly like her father her name was emlyn just like he wanted it i covered my mouth sinking into the sofa putting my head in my hands as i thought sadly there was too much i was numb how come you named her emlyn didntyou hate sirius lily asked i could hear her frown no matter how much i tried to hate him i couldn t she said you should ve known he would never do that you knew him better then any of us i said guess not she said silence passed as i willed my temper not to rise at her lack of judgment in a man she had known so well for so long what your story i heard her ask faintly i couldntanswer her how could i it had been a lie dumbledore had lied to us but she was back in our lives i let lily explain what happened that night as i thought about padfoot reaction to her and the news i could see the grin on his face how the life in his eyes would spark up then die again when he found out about emlyn about the lie about piper shame and neither of us could bare it and i didntwant to be the one to break the news to him that she was alive but his baby wasn t that he d been a father of a baby girl for four years without his knowledge then suddenly that title was stolen from him like everything else james is it true sirius is innocent i want to hear it from you piper said quietly i looked at her and nodded seeing relief in her eyes rushed quickly by guilt yeah all peter fault he voldemort man then wouldntkat have known she asked not unless peter told voldemort about the real reason kat as there voldy would ve kept peter a secret so pettigrew could spy on us i said why do you think he killed kat peter killed kat she whispered that what i believe i nodded day before halloween she probably found about him that when she was killed i still dontbelieve it she sighed believe it we re all in this position because of little peter i said saying his name like it was the most filthy thing on earth and of course it was sirius is innocent piper sighed piper my cousin my friend had aged in the same sense that lily and i had she was beautiful beyond belief still her turquoise eyes her black red streaked hair her tall form her welsh hint in her speech she was back after fiercely hugging lily piper hiccupped then calmed enough ask if she could talk to sirius i went out of the room as soon as i gave her the mirror arentyou gonna stick around piper asked pleadingly the mirror clutched in her hands if i stay and hear his reaction my brain will explode plus i need to speak with dumbledore i said she nodded with an understanding look sitting down snuggly next to her best friend tears streaming down her face as she called his name in the mirror i ran up the stairs their reaction to each other would kill me and i might kill the old coot named dumbledore i stuck my head in the fireplace after throwing the needed amount of floo powder in the fireplace of the library the old man was sitting with his back towards the fireplace humming like a bumble bee professor i asked he turned around ah james he smiled good to see you i gave him a weak smile we found piper i said imagine a 6 3 guy who hasntdone anything indignant since he was 20 years old and had learned to be serious for the past 5 years doing a little happy dance upon being the first man to make dumbledore eyes widen and i felt the joy i had missed so terribly much after 5 years return when he confirmed her story harry godmother sirius fianc lily best and greatest friend and my cousin was

lol especially with the crazed werewolf eh angelgirl1517 hehee thank you lovie thank you for putting up with me disclaimer if i owned hp hbp wouldnthave happened lol enjoy dontfoget to press that little review button hehehehe ch 9 the hate the greed that feeds me putting my ha t back on and stuffing my hands in my pockets i dashed around groups of people practically running towards harry and hagrid i never thought i would miss the hustle and bustle of diagon alley but i did walking past the quiddich supply store and the joke shop i could recount every second i spent in the two stores with padfoot i knew the two were headed to gringotts having told dumbledore to order hagrid to first go there i felt that if harry saw the gold we left him he would realize that we hadntabandoned him i wish to god i could ve seen the aw stricken expressions on his face as when he laid his eyes on the magnificent stores or his eyes widening when he was told he was harry potter the boy who lived and a wizard i stopped walking right next to the bank standing sideways so i could see the door to the bank i looked at the window display not really seeing it just using it as a mirror to look for familiar faces and potential threats to my son i spotted a few of people that had been in my year at hogwarts from every house my eyes bugged when i saw frank longbotton mother along with a boy who looked around harry age my heart stopped when i remembered going into dumbledore pensieve for the trial i had seen barty crouch jr son of crouch sr the bastard along with sirius cousin bellatrix and rabastan lestrange stand trial for torturing frank and alice and their son neville if memory serves was a possible candidate for the meaning of the prophecy it had been up to either neville or harry who would defeat voldemort the two were born a few days apart at the end of july but what happened to frank and alice no nightmare could sum it up frank was my friend i ve known him since i was 5 our dads were good friends so the two of us were close hung out together during and after hogwarts alice and lily were good friends and our boys played together while we the parents talked now seeing him just overwhelmed me when i remembered dumbledore telling me that frank and ally as she was usually called had gone insane from the torture i wanted to cry but held the emotions in when i saw harry and hagrid come out of the crooked building harry passed neville without knowing his baby playmate at all it tore me apart i followed harry to madam malkins when he got fit for school robes as i looked at the colorful ow l s perched on cages and whatnot i saw this beautiful snow white owl that resembled the one i had before it was intercepted by death eaters stupid bastards there was a little whizzing fur ball zooming around the cage i frowned then realized it was a tiny little owl that interesting i mumbled harry came out of malkin holding a few wrapped packages i smiled at the excitement in his beautiful eyes the satisfied look in those eyes made me remember lily the first time i saw her in the alley around this time 20 years before they then went to flourish and blotts and soon he had potion ingredients cauldrons and big fat books in his hands all that was left was a wand and harry next stop was ollivanders hagrid left harry alone for this particular stop and left all i could concentrate on was harry alone with a man i could never fully trust i stood outside the window shop pretending to read the prophet as i listened and watched closely the old man pulled out a long thin box pulled out a wand and gave it to harry glad to see he a righty like me and not a lefty like his mother harry looked a bit startled when ollivander barked well give it a wave harry obliged and managed to knock off boxes from the shelves i chuckled hiding behind my newspaper i had knocked off two shelves blew three bulbs and nearly poked ollivander eye out before i found my wand when harry was given the third wand and waved it golden sparks flew out my son had just found his first wand curious i head the wand maker say very curious e excuse me sir but what curious harry asked politely it curious that you should get this wand when its brother gave you that scar ollivander said pointing at harry forehead after explaining stuff about how the wand chooses the wizard my ears were ringing the same phoenix that had given a tail for my son wand had also produced one for voldemort s i didntknow anything about wands and wizards all i know is that for two people to share the same wand core they have to have something huge in common like sirius remus and my wand have the same core but all i could think about harry and voldy having something in common was they were both half bloods dumbledore and i had a lot to discuss my first question to him was if harry could be in any danger out of the corner of my eye i saw hagrid walking towards the store carrying a big cage with the snowy white own hooting inside it hagrid enthusiastically knocked on the shop window happy birthday harry he smiled i smiled behind my paper it was indeed my boy birthday well the day before it anyway and his mother and godparent and i had spent the day talking about his 1st birthday we had managed in getting a mirthless chuckle out of sirius who was steadily getting worst but i will not discuss him if i want to keep my mind after that they um we headed back to the cauldron for some food before they went to king cross i once again took my seat at the bar close to the table the two were sitting at eating soup he killed my parents didnthe he asked abruptly i chocked on the coffee i was drinking sir are you alright tom asked pounding on my back yes yes thank you i said shakily when my air pipes had reopened thank you i nodded swallowing hard i stared into my cup listening to hagrid explain to harry that some wizards went bad and how voldemort killed anyone who got in his way he meant the potters as harry asked the name of the man that had made him an orphan i remembered the night bitterly we had just left remus and kat flat after our annual halloween grieve athon disaster always struck on halloween for us this year we only thought piper disappearance was the disaster as we sat in silence for most of the night lily had just come downstairs after putting harry to bed she came into the kitchen looking extremely beautiful in her black turtle neck she wrapped her arms around my waist as i washed the dishes having been forbidden to them by magic that was horrible she stated he better then he was a week ago i said question did you find peter leaving early a bit odd she asked kissing my shoulder with the war everyone busy i shrugged do you really think we should ve switched with sirius lily asked as i finished i ve known peter for years i think he safe really safe actually i turned around so i face d her worried eyes dontdwell on it much he practically a squib no one will give him a second thought but sirius is still in danger she breathed sighing i nodded he a big boy i swallowed as i led her back to the living room we were bout to go upstairs when i heard something outside stopping me what wrong honey lily asked i thought i heard something i said frowning my arms still around her shoulders james she asked what did you hear i didnthave a chance to answer because harry let out a heart wrenching cry from upstairs lily was about to run upstairs looking as terrified as i never having heard him wail this bad when the door blew off it hinges i immediately shoved lily behind me and took out my wand lily nails dug into my bicep as a tall figure wearing a black cloak beneath the hood of the figure red eyes glowed as i raised my wand harry crying intensified by ten octaves go to him i said as the figure known as voldemort walked in no she said tears evident in her voice i not leaving you lily i growled her grip increasing on my arm ah i glad i found you both home today the cold soulless voice behind the cloak hissed my mrs potter you wontinvite me in for tea what manners your wife has james get out i snarled standing protectively in front of lily with an arm in front of her preventing any movement from her towards him not that i had to worry not until i get what i want he said and just for that potter i dontknow what hi t me except millions of white hot knives pierced every inch of my body i couldntbreath i couldntthink about anything except say lily go i bit my lip so hard to prevent the oncoming scream that i felt it began to bleed james no she moaned as voldemort cackled go i yelled holding on to the banister with both hands trying to regain control over my body and not topple over that enough he said coldly and it stopped but the ringing in my ear and spots around the room didntdisappear neither did the painful memory now i want to do this quick and easy potter get out of the way or what voldy i asked trying get my breathing back to normal giving him the dirtiest looks i could manage and if looks could kill voldemort would ve long been dead you really dontwant to know he sneered as i spotted wormtail behind him though i couldntsee his face i knew it was him who else could it be i see you brought your henchman to kiss your ass i nodded towards peter wanting nothing more then to jump on him and kill him with my bare hands no wand no curses just bare hands tell me voldy how the sex i d gone too far but oh well that enough from you voldemort yelled sending green sparks towards us i pulled lily down with me just enough time go to harry i hissed her teary eyes stared into mine james no she moaned do it what if he kills you she asked this quick conversation took less time then when said then written if you and harry are safe i ll be quite satisfied with my fate please lils i begged as voldemort ducked his own curse as it bounced off the handy family shield hanging on the wall of the landing upstairs no she whimpered please i said again she looked at me for a moment just come back to me i will i ll hold him off long enough for you and harry to get the hell out of her e i said i remember those two minutes now how i was getting ready to die for my family to say good bye how i was mourning over the fact that i would never taste her again never hold him in my arms we both stood up i sent a well placed impedimenta towards him to my surprise he blew across the room landing against the wall with a thud not as powerful as you claimed ha voldy i ll kill you he yelled there are wors e things then dying i said thinking it was my last stand nothing got in his way especially a wise cracking victim like yours truly dumbledore man still are you potter he asked through and through i bowed keeping my eyes on him i like you potter you would ve been a good death eater he said now that worse than death i pointed out he cackled and there was a pop he had dissaparated as i was wondering where he went i heard lily shriek my question was answered cursing voldemort and lily for not having left i flew to harry nursery as i burst through the door i stopped horrified oh jesus i managed as i saw harry floating in mid air when he saw me with his big wet green eyes he reached out his hands and said dadda i wanted nothing more then to run to him grab him and comfort him but as i looked at him i was sure that if i died trying to save him it would perfectly ok with me james lily yelled i knew enough to jump out of the way when someone yells your name with that much terror i saw the nursery wall explode you d better pay for that i said as i saw lily send the craciatus on him holy shit i muttered as voldy that right voldemort himself howled with pain but my satisfaction was short lived suddenly he stood up straight again cackling that was mighty brave potter mrs potter i mean he laughed making harry cry harder you know i can kill you she breathed you also know that harry can too so get the hell out no i think not he sneered my heart missed about five beats as he flung a hand out waved it and harry zoomed across the room hit the wall and landed crying on the ground no lily and i both yelled and made to go to him but met the same fate and slammed against the opposite wall my back gave an unhealthily loud crack and i couldntmove my arm all i could do was put my arm across lily chest and draw her near it us you want you despicable coward leave him out of this i yelled fearing my throat would rip into shreds that right potter that why i here he smiled to cut a deal with you you mean with the devil he cackled never stop with the jokes do you according to wormtail anyway he claims you re incapable of two seconds without wise cracks did he also tell you he thinks you re a coward and an asshole maybe he mentioned it when he was kissing your ass i asked looking at harry who was crying so loud all heaven angels and those in hell could hear him i ll ignore that he said advancing towards us darn i said sarcastically trying to get lily closer to me her body screaming at me to rescue her from this menace the deal is that you leave your son forever so you will not bestow any of your powers upon him he said you mean just leave harry and go asked lily shock and pain in her voice i d rather die i said through clenched teeth isntthis situation one you might consider worse then death potter he asked therefore i wontdo you the horror of killing you or your lovely wife or son this is the first time ever that i am giving anybody an option and if you are as smart as you claim you will consider it you vow to never set a foot in the wizarding world after tonight and i will not kill your son until he read y for a duel where he will die at my wand what the hell makes you think he wontkill you i yelled my eyes were only for my crying son you and your wife wontbe training him as i said i promise never to harm harry until he ready to face me only on the basis that you two are never heard from again and if you dontobey your precious heir will die before he lived he cackled as i saw blood i would ve jumped him right there but my back and lily tight gri p on my arm prevented any movement james m maybe we should deal lily whispered fear ravaging her face what i yelled dadda harry wailed my heart skipped again i couldntgo to him i couldntease his pain but i looked at lily you cantmean that it would mean harry safety she breathed we need time to consider wrong mrs potter because unlike the villains in those books you love i will give you no deliberation time you answer right now the cold soulless voice said he ll be safe lily cried i shook my head the idea of him being away tearing me apart i can t james there no other choice she said squeezing my arm i looked at her hating her for making sense i turned my eyes to the red snake eyes behind the hood alright you got what you wanted now go he sneered and turned his back on lily and i i heard the words saw the green light saw harry eyes begging me to help him to keep my promise and save him as he said dadda again i couldntact couldntmove fast enough to shield him from the curse but lunged at him anyway harry i yelled as the green hit him but the prolonged moment ended by a scream not the throaty scream of the horror struck mother laying behind me not myself and not my baby boy but from the murderer i looked at voldemort and saw well light coming out of his stomach then suddenly nothing was there anymore except a cloak grabbing the side of my son crib i stood up shakily as i did so a wisp of smoke rose from the cloak with voldmort hideous face screaming as he went through me i lost my balance but held on to the banister the house began rattling it took no genius to figure out that the house was about to collapse lily dove for harry covering him with her body as she clutched him to her chest i in turn dove for lily and covered them both praying as beam s fell through the roof an idea hit a godsen t i got a hold of harry hand and lily wrist and dissaparated the three of us the furthest i could take them our backyard i didntget off of them until my home was only a pile of dust like voldemort that what you get for breaking a promise kissing lily cheek i got off realizing my arm was broken in more then one place you alright i asked lily as she sat up harry on her chest lily nodded erratically as harry reached for me again dadda he said again he threw himself in my arms i squeezed his body close as he stood on my upper thighs in his blue pajamas oh god i said in his little shoulder as i remembered how close i had come to losing him i rocked us back in forth for an eternity hoping i could make everything all r ight again make him forget lily joined us and it turned into a group hug one of her arms was in my hair the other around harry body i pulled back maybe 10 minutes later and looked at harry who had calmed despite the rolling stream down his cheeks alright emeralds i asked examining his dust covered face house go boom he said sadly bluntly putting his head on my chest but i didntnotice that too busy with something else i pushed aside a few strands of hair from his eyes to reveal the now legendary scar hey lils look at this she looked and her eyes bugged his mother boy i chuckled half heartedly trying to swallow everything that had happened i need to get sirius and dumbledore down here i pushed harry away from me lightly well attempted to anyway no he said firmly finding his place on my chest again i looked at lily you mind i smiled he got a death grip on me pardon the jibe she nodded since we have no way to contact dumbledore i ll get the mirror for sirius in my pocket i nodded she moved my right arm to get to the mirror watch it i yelped sorry she said managing to get to the mirror without further murder of my arm i didnthear lily conversation i only could hold my son when i came back to reality hagrid was taking the 11 year old harry to catch the hogwarts express i ran behind them though keeping a fair distance i walked behind harry as he tried to find platform 9 hagrid having abruptly disappeared harry pushed the trolley back in forth between 9 and 10 looking as puzzled as lily had her first time i was about to go tell him where it was when i spotted 6 redheads 4 of them pushing trolley full of equipment head to the barrier i smiled molly weasley praying that somehow harry would figure out they were wizards i h i d behind a muggle newspaper and harry did catch on they were wizards as the three tallest boys ran through the barrier i saw harry approach molly she smiled he looked at the boy i assuming he a 1st year too with a nod and a determined look harry ran into the wall and disappeared into such an adventurous world and such adventures welcome back mr harry james potter i smiled i decided to head home spend time with lily and go to hogwarts the next day for the sorting ceremony an hello my
