 twilight evabandmamber13 chapter one beginning it was a hot sunny sunday in privet drive little whinging a day where no one in his or her right mind would take a step outdoors however on number four a sixteen year old black haired boy sat outside leaning against a tree trunk salvaging what little shade that could be found looking longingly into the tidy house in which an equally tidy family lived in harry potter however was not a normal child who was sent outdoors as a punishment for some misdoing on this scorching hot day he was a wizard and that fact alone earned him the spite and hatred of his last surviving relatives the dursleys the dursleys who prided themselves on being perfectly normal treated harry potter as one would to bubble gum stuck on a sole of one shoe harry heard laughter doors being slammed shut and a car motor start those sounds meant that his detested relatives had finally gone out to dinner meaning he could go back into the house recently the dursleys had gathered with a nearby family the spellgoods and quite often the two families had visited each other homes and went out for dinner harry being the freak he was naturally wasntinvited to any of these social proceedings in fact he was forbidden to show his face whilst any member of the spellgood family was in the dursley household this was why he had been sitting out in their back yard hiding from sight the only explanation would be the fact that he was different and the dursleys did not want him to ruin the budding friendship the family had with the spellgoods harry had heard that they were rich in influential in the society naturally someone his uncle vernon and aunt petunia would like to associate themselves with harry was living with his relatives not by choice but as his parents were murdered by the legendary dark wizard lord voldemort who servant had killed harry godfather a year ago sirius black the only parent figure he ever had to look up to lord voldemort himself was now furiously waging war on the magical community and over the past year the magical community was plagued by sudden attacks however everyone knew that the worst was yet to come harry suffered through his summer vacation knowing only that in one week time he would leave number four privet drive and never return in one week time he would be seventeen years old the wizarding standard for being an adult harry took off his shoes gingerly stepped across the clean white tiled kitchen and strode upstairs to the bathroom where he scraped off all the dirt that had cemented itself in his shoes sweeping the scraps of dirt into the toilet bowl and flushing he walked to his room quickly placed them in his room and ran off to take a shower as he dried himself off he looked into the mirror and noticed for the first time that he no longer was the little boy who lived he had grown up fast approaching adulthood yet he often thought of his first trip on the hogwarts express where he met his friends ron weasley and hermione granger and his detested enemy the snobbish draco malfoy harry walked to his room relishing the two hours of spare time he had before the dursleys came back from dinner deciding that he would make a start on his nastily long potions essay on congeniality droughts when a tiny owl flew into his bedroom window there was a loud crack as the owl collided forming a silk like pattern of cracks in the window harry swore and ran to the window as he opened it the tiny owl flew dizzily much like it was drunk and collapsed onto the floor harry immediately picked up the owl and placing it in hedwig his own owl cage hedwig moved over in her cage to allow the dizzy owl a drink of water disorientated the owl knocked the water over causing hedwig to screech and harry to cover his ears replacing the water tray harry walked out of the room and opened the letter harry smiled upon seeing the sender it was from ron weasley his best friend from the wizarding school of hogwarts with enclosed with two boxes he opened the letter dear harry we re pretty busy here doing you know what well i cantsay much in this letter in case it gets intercepted anyway good news dumbledore ll let you come earlier this year you know where me mum and ginny are going there in a week and we ll pick you up along the way hermione wontbe coming her entire family is in the protection zone you know who got another family yesterday a young muggle born witch and her family in sqwacher valley harry dontdo anything stupid okay there are just a few more days and we re coming dontlet the muggles get you down ron p s fred and george have enclosed some new products of theirs for you p p s mum dad bill charlie and ginny say hi harry grimaced last year it had been declared unsafe for any owls to be confidentially sent from wizard to wizard as it was rumored that dark forces were intercepting certain owls in harry opinion he didntthink voldemort would be too concerned about catching owls delivering everyday material it took a lot of effort to chase down owls and death eaters flying around on broomsticks would definitely attract some attention looking at the two boxes carefully he opened one of them and immediately jerked backwards as multi colored rabbits flew out and jumped around harry was puzzled as he picked up a small note at the bottom of the box to our benevolent funder we have enclosed 7 rainbow bouncing bunnies a sample of what your fine donation has led to over the years try the other sweets but leave those bunnies for someone you hate gred and forge www head wizards harry opened the second package and found nothing but a round tart cautious of what it might do harry sniffed it it smelt normal enough of chocolate and fresh cream harry tentatively nibbled off a piece and swallowed bracing himself for any horrible transformations it was actually quite tasty nothing happened not at all like fred and george he looked in the mirror and staring back at him was the same boy with the same features as he had before he ate the tart seeing nothing wrong he ate the rest of the tart but as soon as he sunk his teeth into the cream he munched on something hard and unpleasant spitting it out he found a piece of parchment be ready at 9 o clock with your belongings burn when you ve finished reading the letter was unsigned but he recognized the writing it was dumbledore one of the world most brilliant wizards and the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the leader of the fight against voldemort harry immediately went to the kitchen turned up the fire on the stove and burnt the letter he would not use magic yet underage wizardry would surely alert the ministry of magic on his tracks and arouse attention attention would lead to questions and questions would lead to danger harry watch read five minutes past seven packing would need to be done he was leaving the dursleys for good at quarter to nine harry stood in the living room with his all his belongings ready to leave harry silently urged time to go faster the dursleys might be home any second and they certainly wouldntappreciate wizards coming into their house he could practically hear uncle vernon voice ring no sir no wizards in our house harry paused for a second the small tiny sliver of his more sensitive side beckoned him to do one last good deed for his relatives to make them forget about him and his world and give them the happiness he had deprived them of the ministry of magic probably had their hands full with coping with voldemort return they werentabout to charge the boy who lived for underage wizardry in a time where all sources were spent on protecting the community from terrorist attacks that could erupt within seconds ten minutes later the dursleys could be heard next door chattering happily to the spellgoods harry looked into as the shapes of the dursleys two massive hulks and one bony figure slowly stood up if he was going to do anything it had to be now they were getting ready to come back after a few seconds of silent debating with himself harry turned his eyes away from the spellgoods house at number three privet drive he moved to sit on the sofa but just as he was about to collapse he heard a voice growl get your arse away from my face potter harry barely managed to stop himself from yelling it was mad eye moody and sitting next to him were remus lupin nymphadora tonks bill weasley minerva mcgonagall and albus dumbledore himself after a few quickly uttered greetings dumbledore quickly took out a jar of what looked like lemon drops and held it out in front of harry harry took a sweet out and started to unwrap it no potter this is the portkey cried mcgonagall harry blushed at his own stupidity more than six years in the wizarding world but some things just couldntcement themselves into common sense he placed a finger onto the jar and everyone else followed suit dumbledore with a quick glance around said are you ready harry yes professor excellent then dumbledore waved his wand and with a tug from behind his navel harry found himself being pulled forwards he closed his eyes when he next opened them the surroundings had totally changed they had arrived the black house the house of his godfather the late sirius black it had certainly changed a lot since he had last seen it two years ago instead of everything being grimy and dirty and covered with portraits of sirius unpleasant relatives harry now found a magically expanded hall which was immaculately cleaned and carried no trace of the living room that had been there two years ago once my name cleared if you wanted a a different home sirius voice haunted this house and harry memories still silently tears started to well up in harry eyes harry found the entire house expanded with quarters for permanent residents such as hermione and ron families the place was now suitable for people clean and cozy looking and yet devoid of happiness he not your son he as good as who else has he got he got me not anymore sirius not anymore the house was empty besides a few unrecognized people that dumbledore nodded to those few people went about their business without any words dumbledore tapped harry on the shoulder and led him into an empty room and closed the door behind them harry turned around and spoke to dumbledore professor what going on with voldemort right now the old wizard sighed deeply and when he spoke his voice was laced with fatigue harry i fear this time around he has gained power a lot faster and his domination has already started he has taken knockturn alley the icelands and many wizarding settlements across europe voldemort is now constantly assaulting the borders of diagon alley harry gasped he had no idea how much damage voldemort had done over the summer since he had left for privet drive none was heard about voldemort besides the occasional assaults on random targets i afraid its only a matter of time before the defences are compromised we have been doing all we can but our opportunity to get a head start on voldemort was ruined by fudge i fear a second age of darkness may begin harry saw pain in the old man eyes pain that had gradually destroyed the twinkle that used to inhibit those blue eyes of the venerable wizard harry then noticed a long scar along dumbledore aged face fudge has finally taken some drastic action in doubling the numbers of aurors however the ministry is in disarray with the many death eaters in the top ranks no one knows who to trust just like the old times at this dumbledore eyes flared with hatred an emotion seldom seen on the wizard expressions that idiot if he had just listened to us years ago none of this would be be as it may what done is done harry now i must tell you to be careful and not to leave grimmauld place until i tell you to you do know how important you are harry did indeed know more than he had ever wanted to know at the end of his fifth year at hogwarts dumbledore had revealed to him a prophecy that was given by none other than harry divination teacher professor trelawney concerning himself and voldemort he remembered the words all too clearly the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies this prophecy could basically be condensed into one sentence he harry would have to kill voldemort or be killed by voldemort it was not a comforting thought becoming a murderer or dying for a month time harry had one sentence echoing in his head kill or be killed fortunately harry had realized that when the time for the confrontation came it would come and he would wait until that day happens and try to enjoy life as well as he could his sixth year was strangely inactive with him actually experiencing a relatively normal year with just a small incident with a bludger knocking ron off his broomstick in a game against hufflepuff it had taken weeks for his leg to heal since fudge declared that voldemort was back harry had returned again to being the famous and fawned after boy who lived whilst harry despised the fact that he was famous at the cost of his family he did come to see some more positive aspects of being famous last year a year of normalcy for harry hormones got the better of him and through his sixth year he had found the pleasures of dating and not all of the dates were as dull and unexciting as cho chang however after dumping parvati patil a fellow gryffindor for the fifth time in one year harry decided that he had enough no more relationships unless they were serious harry friends had also gotten a share of publicity despite the limelight being fixed on the boy who lived luna lovegood was no longer the odd laughingstock of hogwarts after word had spread that she was one of the students that had been in the company of harry in the strangely mysterious adventure in which no details had been revealed in fact she had her own little fan club following her around consisting of several timid fifth and sixth years luna being luna noticed none of them harry smiled at the thought of five wizards following an oblivious luna lovegood around the halls of hogwarts ron ginny hermione and neville were the least affected by their rise in attention they went about their lives as usual hermione and ron were used to being the friends of the boy who lived however harry fame was not limited with giggling schoolgirls only the whole wizarding world looked to him as a symbol of light and hope he was their icon their model in the war against voldemort he was living proof that voldemort was not superhuman he was the boy who survived multiple encounters with the dark lord harry snapped out of his thoughts and nodded to his headmaster very well harry i trust you will like to go see your friends now i will be in contact every few days if possible be careful said dumbledore and without waiting for a response he swept out of the room harry immediately picked up his trunk and broomstick and lugged them up to his room at the black house he opened the room to find that it had changed no longer a dusty dirty bed but a smooth mahogany one with a mattress and about 10 pillows harry put his trunk in the middle of the room and sat down on his bed closing his eyes allowing his mind to drift away until he heard a shriek and jumped up with his wand out a red haired cannonball hit him wrapping herself around him in a firm hug with a squeal of delight ginny weasley harry dropped his wand unintentionally the air in him knocked out harry grinned as he returned the hug and said ginny at a loss of anything else to say the once timid girl had really gotten to know harry during his sixth year when ron and hermione were dating and unintentionally isolated him he could safely say that ginny now took the position of 3rd best friend to the boy who lived since his two best friends had broken up and returned to normal ron hermione harry here hollered the redhead finally letting go of harry almost immediately another redhead and a bushy haired brunette came flying into the room hermione gave harry a hug commenting on how he grew in the few weeks they were apart and ron looking like he was going to give harry a hug too but instead just pat him on the back harry smiled at ginny unconsciously seeing his friends again filled a void in his heart a void that had spawned from spending weeks with the dursleys harry then struck up a conversation about the summer holidays ending in uproarious laughter on how dudley the human elephant had somehow managed to fall in love with the prettiest yet most horrible girl in privet drive lisa spellgood harry had a wonderful night catching up with his three best friends but when he went to bed that night he smiled the rest of the summer would be fun days had passed like a blur as the four friends lounged around the house all day playing chess gobstones exploding snap or anything they could get their hands on harry could easily say his time at grimmauld place although haunted by images of sirius was the best time of his summer however quidditch was off limits as it would involve leaving the house and exposing themselves on one windy morning harry woke up to a new world grinning he saw that it was the morning of the 31st of july his birthday grinning with glee harry decided his first legal magical action would be to apparate to ginny and hermione room and yell out he was of age with a slight pop harry appeared in ginny and hermione room letting out a yell that he was of age i seven oh i sorry he stuttered the girls had been busy wrapping up a present still in their pajamas you re seven exclaimed ginny the two girls burst out laughing and ran towards him to give him a hug and wish him a happy birthday he smiled his birthday was already off to the perfect start he gave the two a wave and apparated to ron room to give the redhead a nice sharp awakening bloody hell harry yelled ron as a jet of water blasted him in the face in a matter of hours after a hearty birthday breakfast harry found himself sitting in a circle with friends and people who he considered to be family mrs weasley had organized a small gathering for harry birthday seeing as they could not get many people to come as the location of the order of the phoenix headquarters must not be leaked out and dumbledore strict orders were for harry to stay in grimmauld place until permission was given harry was shocked and delighted amongst those that came there was remus tonks mad eye moody the patil family all the weasleys the grangers professor mcgonagall and even dumbledore the day was spent lightheartedly drinking butterbeer playing games eating delicious food and lounging about at long last molly weasley announced it was time to open presents harry was as excited as a little boy as he ran headfirst into his pile of presents and shredded the wrappings of the first one open it was from parvati a silver colored chain a small round golden amulet in the middle with the letters h and p engraved into it harry wasntquite sure if it was standing for harry potter or harry and parvati harry smiled anyways giving parvati a hug and putting it on parvati grinned the next he opened was a present from arthur and molly weasley it was a peculiar object shaped like a miniature muggle flashlight arthur whispered in harry ear that he d explain about it later and harry gave mr and mrs weasley a hug harry noted to himself that it was strange that he was hugging people he was after all an adult wizard now was hugging a childish act shaking it off he turned back to the presents a small letter grasped harry attention however and he opened it finding a letter from gringotts the wizard bank dear mr harry james potter upon your seventeenth birthday there are two accounts where the assets will need to be transferred to your vault the late james and lily potter full family fortune will be transferred to your vault as of 1 42pm today the funds from the black family vault and a private vault owned by the late sirius black will also be transferred to your vault then please come to sign the necessary forms which will allow you access to these funds the letter was not signed excepting a gringotts stamp everyone in the room was staring at harry and he suddenly remembered he was opening gifts he pocketed the letter gave a significant look to dumbledore ron hermione and ginny and unwrapped the next gift that from me said ron surprisingly harry face dropped as he peered into the box what wrong harry dontyou like it said ron worriedly there nothing in there harry said sadly ron yelped what do you mean there nothing in there there a professional level snitch in there i sure of it i saved up for weeks for that said ron running up to the box harry burst out into laughter and gave his friend a slap on the back sorry ron but the expression on your face was just priceless exclaimed harry ron playfully punched harry who flipped over playfully but really painfully collided with a table drawing laughter from the other people present harry had then opened many more presents until there were just three left he had gotten more weasley wizarding wheezes from fred and george books about curses from tonks his mother lily 7th year diary from remus and an auror guide to survival from mad eye moody which was written incidentally by himself mcgonagall had gotten harry a book on animagi and he got a case of honeydukes snacks from bill and charlie weasley percy had ignored harry birthday as he was still somewhat spiteful about harry being right about voldemort and making him look like a fool in front of the ministry of magic and his family last year harry then turned to the last three presents he turned to hermione first he found unsurprisingly a book however it wasntthe kind of book harry thought he d be receiving there was no title to the book harry flipped through the pages and saw masses of writing along with pictures of him and his friends flashing hermione a smile he placed the book down excepting lily diary this was the most meaningful gift he received so far harry smiled and nodded at hermione harry then turned to a smaller gift which was just a small case he figured this would be ginny as she was watching intently harry opened the gift and gasped it was a ring engraved on it was an phoenix with the letter h in the middle ginny all of a sudden looked like the timid girl harry had met when he was in his second year harry stood up and with a simple thank you he gave her the tightest hug he could muster she smiled as harry picked up the final gift an envelope harry opened the envelope and yet again was another letter harry i albus dumbledore now formally invite you into the order of the phoenix in which you may immediately take your father old rank if you wish enclosed is the initiation badge which glows when you are with another member of the order you may make your decision to join or not by discarding the badge or placing it on yourself take your time it is a very important decision to make albus dumbledore harry looked his headmaster in the eye took out a beautiful glowing phoenix badge and pinned it on his shirt i formally agree to join the order of the phoenix and i will provide any service required of myself possible the order members smiled tonks and remus smirking slightly at this and harry found that his badge had disappeared harry spluttered where where again the order members smiled dumbledore spoke up with a smile harry you will find that you are now one of us a mental link is made between all members of the order you can feel them around you concentrate harry and you will understand as you are surely aware physical possessions do not mean a lot the badge was merely a substitute until you found yourself intertwined with the members of the order it seems you have miraculous speed in doing so harry concentrated on remus lupin for a second and found himself feeling his former professor aura he smiled a wonderful sense of joy flew through harry he was now part of what his parents had valued above everything else an order full of the greatest wizards of his time harry felt for the first time in his life that his birthday was a spectacular day to be alive after a massive birthday dinner cooked by a couple of house elves from hogwarts and a cake baked by ginny and mrs weasley harry had wandered outside away from the festivities to get a breath of fresh air he had just walked to an old treestump gazing upwards at the sky when a voice startled him from behind care for company harry smiled without turning around he knew it was ginny sure gin you know i still haventasked how your holidays were this year did those muggles treat you better guess you could say so though when the spellgoods came over they chucked me outside but all in all it was much better well that good said ginny and pulled harry up c mon let walk around they walked around the backyard in a comfortable silence ginny hand still holding harry s they had come to a large maple tree and ginny stopped in her tracks harry turned to look at his friend and he saw in his friend stead a whole different person she had been a different person for more than two years now but never had it shone so clearly confidence radiated from her eyes which were constantly alight even when none had challenged her none had done anything to aggravate her it was weasley spirit channeled by fred and george for the most part harry could ve swore there and then was a laugh in ginny eyes a distinct sparkle of mischief and naivety never had he noticed such before the moonlight shone upon them illuminating them in a pale unearthly glow harry smiled softly at ginny she smiled back a fluttery feeling overtook harry as he looked at the girl in front of him he unconsciously started to lean towards her when a sharp voice invaded his thoughts and brought him jerking back down to reality oh so there you two are you had us worried next time tell us if you re going to go outside come on in now the patils are leaving come say goodbye rang mrs weasley voice harry snapped away from ginny right away mrs weasley sorry we just came out and forgot to keep track of time as mrs weasley form nodded and disappeared back into the house harry let out a nervous little laugh well we should go in now shouldntwe you know okay harry okay gin said harry preparing to ask her if she knew what that strange moment between them was yes never mind let go say goodbye to parvati and padma so they walked back to grimmauld place ginny was shocked why did he lean in was he going to kiss me she thought to herself all of a sudden she caught herself why should she care if harry wanted to kiss her or not she was dating colin creevey harry was just a friend memories of her younger years flooded into her mind of the boy she had heard of day after day in stories of the boy who had defeated voldemort at the age of 1 of the boy who had saved her from the chamber of secrets of the boy who was the youngest quidditch player at hogwarts for a century and of the boy who she had put her elbow in the butter dish for sent valentine cards and get well cards for and she cried unaware of the bushy haired girl that had quietly walked in and put her arm around her all around the world wizarding families raised their glass to harry potter the one hope besides dumbledore they had left for preventing another dark age some saw that dumbledore was slowly but surely weakening his age getting the better of him many people drank to harry potter health that night and many people drank to his misfortune and suffering muggles around the world were the only ones who lay in peaceful ignorance two teenagers looked out into the stars at the same time both wondering about the kiss that never came to be the black haired boy was oblivious to the fact that people were honoring him or cursing him one way or the other around the world no all that filled the boy mind was a beautiful red haired girl with tears in her eyes she was all that mattered to him at that moment somehow harry potter had done it harry potter had fallen for his best friend sister little did anyone know with this little realization a major part of the upcoming war had been played out twilight evabandmamber13 chapter ten the battle on the day when voldemort was due to attack harry hermione ron and ginny had practiced and reviewed all of the charms that could be used for dueling from wingardium leviosa to skeledestructo totalus potter granger weasley weasley come down to the great hall now you will find the corridors absolutely empty of students the attack should come soon bring anything you find necessary for the battle said a crisp sounding professor mcgonagall from the fire the four friends stopped and swept out of the room harry in the lead followed by ginny and ron hermione bringing up the rear ah there they come now said dumbledore as they walked into the great hall now i trust everyone knows where they are going everyone in the hall nodded harry noticed that there were at least ninety wizards and witches there already brandishing their wands after the aurors had left dumbledore had stood up and addressed the order now order members come here as you know our job is the most important we are guarding the front doors now we will need to a loud explosion could be heard followed by many loud cries of pain merlin beard they re here already severus i thought you said no never mind come on we must get to our position dumbledore sprinted out of the great hall with all the members of the order and the staff in his wake oh sweet mother of god whispered hermione the scene was horrible the aurors that had been guarding the forest were chased out or overwhelmed and killed the ones left alive joined the others surrounding the castle it was not as snape had said a hundred strong force there were at least six hundred of them and twenty something giants it looked as if voldemort had emptied out all of his forces in britain harry turned left and saw a skeletal figure stride up at the head of the approaching army voldemort his face horribly pale and his eyes narrow red slits led the wizards and the giants on hurling killing curses all over the place harry shuddered in an effort to look away from voldemort harry saw that there were no dementors but still he saw that they were hopelessly outnumbered when the order stepped out harry felt through the slight link between the auras of the member the pure power of these wizards harry knew that the order of the phoenix was full of wizards from the cream of the crop voldemort paused and looked up at the order so the old fool shows his face again he bellowed and you snape you dare betray your lord feeding my false information filth you shall suffer the consequences crucio before anyone could react snape had doubled over in agony shrieking until voldemort finally lifted the curse just a taster my dear professor when hogwarts is ours you will see what it means to betray lord voldemort aurors around had shuddered in fear snape stood up grim faced still as a statue for once harry appreciated snape he stood there eyeing the most evil wizard ever without any fear at all or at least none was showing harry felt nothing through the order aura you were right about one thing during your first attempt to take power not to attack hogwarts this will be your undoing said dumbledore wisely empty words muggle lover avada kedavra yelled voldemort dumbledore and members of the order had barely dodged the fatal beam of green light with a roar and a symbolic firework of sparks from both sides the battle erupted the sight of it was truly horrible giants yelling and stampeding over wizards all sorts of hexes being thrown and above it all was voldemort and dumbledore furiously dueling a whole area surrounding them was empty for no one wanted to get too close hermione was dueling the death eater dolohov who had knocked her into the hospital wing at the end of the fifth year during that fateful night at the department of mysteries she fought with a passion that could only be sparked by a person wanting to get revenge ron and ginny were amongst members of the order such as remus tonks and kingsley shacklebolt firing volleys of curses into the ranks of the giants harry found himself battling draco and lucius malfoy already away from the main battle near the outskirts of the forbidden forest barely managing to stay away from all of their hexes until bellatrix lestrange showed her face again and challenged him harry old rage reignited this was the woman that had killed his godfather this was the woman that turned neville parents insane harry bared his teeth and brandishing his wand turned to fight all three of them at once avada kedavra roared three voices harry rolled aside and roared skeledestructo totalus the curse flew by the three death eaters but struck a giant right in the arse with a loud holler the giant was reduced to a blob getting nasty are we itty bitty baby potter growing up are you taunted bellatrix lucius and draco laughed appreciatively harry observed with a sick sensation of pleasure in his stomach that draco now had two magical eyes rolling around in their sockets that conjunctivitis curse must ve worked pretty well parasitran magica stupefy torrentoria serpensortia yelled harry in response all of a sudden he felt a strong surge of power flow through his veins and he knew that his absorption charm had hit its target he was also pleased to see that all three death eaters were shrieking at the rainstorm of snakes attack the death eaters defeat them at any costs harry hissed the snakes had slithered off trying to bite at the death eaters avada kedavra roared three voices but only two beams of light had come out harry noticed that nothing came out of lucius malfoy wand harry dived out of the way and yelled obliviate totalus no normal wizard should have been able to do that spell however harry was far from normal he watched as the beam of silver light hit lucius malfoy straight in the stomach and watched as malfoy crumpled into a heap no yelled bellatrix and draco now you know what other people go through when you do things like that you worthless death eaters shouted harry your father deserved you ll pay for that potter crucio bellowed draco harry in turn crumpled and screamed it was about fifteen minutes later did draco raise the curse not so proud and strong now are we potter smirked draco with an evil grin on his disgusting little face his magical eyes going haywire man that felt good no the little baby misses his mudblood mother what do you think draco should we let him go visit her added bellatrix who was also nearly bouncing in delight shall you do the honors why i d be glad to but not before another round of pain dontyou think i most definitely do sneered a new voice harry saw the hated face of peter pettigrew he had not changed one bit still a disgusting little rat harry thought to himself well now they re all here thought harry to himself grimly the man who killed my parents the woman who killed my godfather and the ugly git that going to kill me crucio bellowed bellatrix this time filling harry with another round of pain harry yelled out and when the curse was released he had to bite his tongue to keep from uttering a piteous moan he would let his enemies have no such pleasure wormtail would you like to join in the festivities asked bellatrix in a pleasant sounding tone as if she was asking him if he wanted the last cookie on a plate my pleasure smiled wormtail crucio harry shook violently with pain his throat burning no longer letting any screams escape i think our little baby is all tired out let him go take a nice long nap said bellatrix in her annoying baby voice draco smirked and brandished his wand may i he asked with a horrible smile yes yes said bellatrix let me have one more word with potter before he dies wormtail walked over to harry wretched form and said wickedly when you see your mudblood mother and your father again tell them peter sends his greetings and tell them that i made the right choice as you can plainly see now you may proceed draco let end this now harry knew what was coming but he could not raise himself to defend himself the long series of cruciatus curses had taken away almost all his strength draco took his wand and aimed it right for harry heart it took an eternity for him to utter the words ava no yelled a voice da harry heard the sound of someone running he could feel a strong aura around the person ke harry saw wormtail and bellatrix move sideways in slow motion da harry could see the figure shadow in the noon sun now vra the figure dived straight into the beam of green light a split second before it hit harry and fell over dead wormtail walked over and kicked the body over it was remus lupin no you ing murdering little worthless piece of garbage harry bellowed like a wounded elephant the sight of his father last friend corpse with silver eyes looking lifelessly up at him made harry tap into an energy source he had never known existed rage burned through every little part of him harry jumped up aimed his wand at the three death eaters standing in a tight group and bellowed at the top of his voice skeleincendio bellatrix lestrange shrieked whilst no one could see what was happening to her harry knew her very bones were on fire burning her up from the inside she continued to shriek in agony as she slowly burnt away malfoy and wormtail turned to face harry leave now you two worthless pieces of scum unless you want to die right here right now leave now or i swear you wontlive to see the sunset and when i say leave now i mean leave your precious little lord behind tuck your tails between your legs and run away dontever show your faces again whispered harry in a deadly fury draco and peter with a look into the burning green fire in their enemy eyes quickly ran as fast as their legs would take them into the forest the two death eaters were never very brave people harry surveyed lucius malfoy who was still lying there out cold and bellatrix lestrange who had now fallen to the floor engulfed in flames help she gasped pitifully as the fire roared through her harry knew she had about one more minute to live serves her right he thought with no squeamish feeling that he had always thought he d get after killing his first person it was war and in war only the strongest survive there was no room for being squeamish no room at all harry turned around and ignored her cries turning to remus lupin lying corpse walked over and closed his eyes picking the body up harry walked up slowly to the castle it was a nasty scene apparently the order and the aurors had been outnumbered to such an extent they had been so desperate they called down all the students from third year and above and many a dark wizard found themselves with boils over their faces their legs dancing uncontrollably and their teeth grown to such an extent that they reached their boots as death eaters clutched at the minor problems the schoolyard curses the third fourth and some fifth years caused the sixth and seventh years ran along and stunned them harry thought it wasnta bad strategy at all however he then saw many aurors were lying on the floor dead harry sprinted up to the front doors unnoticed and gently raid down remus lupin body in the safety of the halls of hogwarts grabbing his wand out harry ran back into the fray harry saw with a growing feeling of dread that dumbledore was slowly but surely losing against voldemort he now had a big gash across his forehead the blood flowing out darkening his brilliant red robes dumbledore stumbled voldemort laughed and hurled a killing curse at him dumbledore barely managed to roll out of the way clutching at the gash on his forehead harry knew that he needed to help dumbledore or else it would be the last of the old wizard maximus reducto he yelled flinging a hex at voldemort the curse caught him straight in the back causing him to stumble for a second harry gasped he had expected a lot more well effect to his spell harry had used it once in dumbledore office shattering a stone statue to pieces voldemort had turned around and acted as if it was just a little kid pushing him in the back ahh potter decide to join us at last i afraid i donthave much time for you today so i ll make it short said voldemort with a horrible smile turning to harry without warning voldemort shrieked avada kedavra stellartica lumare once again the two wands linked but this time both wands regurgitated the last spells cast harry saw that voldemort had indeed been dueling dumbledore a long time at least twenty hexes had all ready come out of voldemort wand all being dark magic and one sent a flying knife which must ve caused the gash on dumbledore face harry wand regurgitated his entire duel with malfoy malfoy lestrange and wormtail harry held the connection the best he could but he saw out of the corner of his eye dumbledore shaking his head furiously harry severed the connection and the two fell harry you are not ready yet don t voldemort threw yet another killing curse at harry which was only missed because dumbledore had teleported harry to his side go leave riddle to me harry had no choice he ran to join ron ginny and hermione who were now teaming up against a pair of death eaters with one last look at the battling pair of wizards dumbledore having healed himself in the time harry had bought for him harry only hoped that his distraction gave dumbledore enough time to recover the massive war had finally seemed to die down after an hour all the giants had run away probably never to return to voldemort again and most of the dark wizards lay incapacitated voldemort battle with dumbledore had finally reached such a point in which dumbledore had collapsed fainting on the spot harry ran to take dumbledore place but instead he found twelve aurors already standing face to face with the dark lord they looked scared grim and were trembling slightly but they still stood there all the same voldemort snarled but he knew that there was no way out shouting out some spell there was a violent flash of light and everyone was blinded for a few minutes the next thing harry saw when he opened his eyes was that all the death eaters left standing and voldemort had disappeared the incapacitated wizards were left untouched murmurs went around the crowd and eventually cheers started for they had won the battle oh my someone get the headmaster to the hospital wing hurry shouted mcgonagall who had taken charge now that dumbledore lay in a heap at the floor the next few hours went past like a blur harry and hermione had walked around looking for any injured aurors or order members finding about seven stunned which they revived all the other collapsed ones were dead ron and ginny had joined the order members and what was left of the aurors in securing the prisoners in the dungeons finally late at night the quartet was dismissed and they returned to the head student common room after taking their well earned showers they had exchanged their separate stories and there i was with three death eaters around me outnumbered when mione came in and blew them away exclaimed ron after a lengthy tale of how he had gotten separated from the order with a powerful flipendo curse hermione beamed but really ron was handling the situation wonderfully keeping his cool and all well after that we just followed the order around and helped where we could what happened to you ginny where did you disappear off to ginny sighed nothing interesting like yours i just got separated because i tripped over a death eater who was stunned on the floor all i did was beat a giant and two death eaters then i rejoined you guys harry felt a surge of guilt come up realizing that he hadntbeen there to protect his friends but he also had a glowing sense of happiness that none of them had gotten hurt it was strange though it was like each of my curses went twice as fast as usual and when i hit a giant with a flipendo curse it actually flew backwards a lot of aurors didnteven manage to make a giant budge from stunning curses or anything in fact the only person i saw that was also able to stun a giant was ginny it was like something pumped a whole lot of magical energy into me pondered ron funny that happened to me too said hermione and ginny at the same time what about you harry i dontthink so i didntreally need any extra power unless i remember after i no never mind he finished he didntwant to talk about remus right now hmm hey harry you werentwith us the whole time where did you get off to harry froze he knew that they would eventually get to him he sighed well i didnteven get in formation with the order i saw malfoy and chased him to the edge of the dark forest half an hour later there were unshed tears in harry bright green eyes and he jumped right into the killing curse to save me hermione and ginny were now watching harry silently tears pouring down their cheeks ron sat with a look that held respect sorrow and anger damn malfoy he said i going to be the one that going to bring him down one day i swear what worse is its all my fault if only i hadntstopped to yell at malfoy and lestrange i wouldnthave been hit with the cruciatus curse the first time which wouldnthave led to more then i wouldntneed to have been saved i so stupid argh i dontdeserve to sit here talking to three of the greatest friends a guy could ask for i should be the one being placed into a coffin i shouldntbe here it all my fault harry had stopped and buried his head between his arms hermione and ron started to say something along the lines of dontworry harry it isntyour fault it voldemort fault but ginny abruptly stood knocking over two cushions on the sofa to the floor harry listen to me remus died for you dontsit here and waste minutes of your life doing this there was a reason he did what he did and that is to give you more time you should mourn remus and move on like he would want you to in case you haventnoticed today the war has now formally broken out voldemort supporters have already taken much of europe remember remus but do not blame yourself for him you said that you needed time to get over things and see that it wasntyour fault before concerning sirius but now time is a luxury you cantafford why are you talking about it as if someone we dontknow off in madagascar or something died this is remus yelled harry who stood up to match ginny move this naturally wouldnta good move by harry as ginny temper was known as the worst of all of the weasleys but he had never experienced it firsthand ginny faltered for a second but then gathered her wits harry if you dontunderstand why he died i guess i canthelp you have you realized that he might ve done it for the sake of mankind and not just for you even if it was just for you you should revel in the fruits of his labor or else his death means nothing we would die for you any day harry me ron hermione because you know what we re family and family sticks together always no matter what happens understand remus choice he did it because you were his family you were all that he had left at least now he is with his friends and family again for the last time harry none of this is your fault and this is absolutely the last time i tell you it come talk to me again when you pull your head out of your arse and realize that you arentthe only person the world is fighting the war for and that remus lupin was a good man and he would ve done it for anybody ginny walked right out of the room and up the staircase harry stood dumbstruck apparently it was ginny that always jerked him out of moods like this in fact her comments on family had really moved him harry looked to ron and hermione who nodded gently and he ran up to the head girl dorms before he entered he heard ginny crying softly he knocked twice ginny who was sitting on her bed hugging her knees and burying her head in her hands said without lifting her head come in hermione oh you dontknow how bad that made me feel i cantbelieve i said that to poor harry it just that he needed to know i just hope he doesntoverreact or anything you know how much i love him since i gotten to know him properly oh god hermione what if he doesntwant to speak to me anymore ginny sniffed and looked up at last she gasped when she saw who it was i would never not want to speak to you ginny i just came up here to thank you for telling me what i needed to know and for snapping me out of it now i also want to thank you for caring you dontknow what it means to me ginny was torn between anger at harry for listening to her talk about him silently and wanting to embrace him she chose the latter they held each other close one hour later when they had walked down to the common room again harry found ron holding a crying hermione in his arms harry had just then remembered how remus lupin was also a good friend and teacher to ron and hermione harry and ginny walked over to them and sat down in the sofa accio butterbeers muttered harry and four bottles of butterbeer flew from his trunk into his hands and he handed them out to each of his friends tonight we drink to remus lupin said harry tonight we drink to life said hermione tonight we drink to hope said ron forever we drink to family ended ginny the four friends clinked their bottles and chugged down the bottles of butterbeer later that night harry snuck out to the marauder room once more when he had approached to the marauder shield he bent down in front of it and broke down i sorry remus i sorry sirius and i sorry dad i ended up costing all of your lives i promise you that a day of reckoning will come i promise i will honor and i will not make your sacrifices be in vain and the time you ve bought for me will be well spent i promise i will make you all proud harry wiped a tear from his eyes which immediately turned hard and emotionless as he surveyed the segment of the shield where the rat was wormtail i let you live again today as your final chance it probably wasntwise but should you not use your final chance well the next time we meet will be the last i swear upon my father grave that it will be so said harry passionately harry waved his wand over the rat of the shield and left the marauder room six hundred miles away in a small flat in paris a short man with a large bald patch on his head small watery eyes and a pointed nose shook violently in his sleep t would soon escalate to frightening scales twilight evabanmamaber13 chapter eleven one amongst us it was mid december and christmas shopping was proving to be a problem for the student population of hogwarts since the battle of hogwarts as the students called it the teachers had imposed very strict rules absolutely no roving around was to be accepted after curfew any student caught would first be given a week of detention as a punishment and if they were caught again they were suspended for a week and if although no students had been foolish enough to sneak out three times they were caught again they would be expelled from hogwarts the only students allowed out at night were harry and hermione and the seventh year prefects who monitored the halls harry and hermione job was a little more complex hermione was supposed to monitor the marauder map for any strange happenings around the schools from eleven o clock to one and report to harry if she saw something out of place from couples snogging in the astronomy tower to death eaters coming out of secret passages it was harry job to catch these students and report any possibly dangerous scenarios to dumbledore in person portkeys to dumbledore office had been made for each seventh year prefect harry and hermione activated with a tap of the wand for emergencies so far however nothing very interesting had happened although harry had caught dennis creevey getting a little too friendly with a hufflepuff third year he had reported them and dennis had turned a strange shade of green as he apologized profusely to the headmaster remus lupin funeral had come and gone a few days after the battle of hogwarts it was simple and not many people had attended a few ministry workers who knew him at school aurors and order members hogwarts teachers harry ginny ron and hermione had attended his small funeral which was held in the graveyard that held harry parents graves it had been a hard day to endure and harry had shut himself away for a week afterwards wallowing in misery it had been ginny yet again that had snapped him out of his reverie with a few well chosen words dumbledore had returned to normal after a few weeks although he had been in critical condition after his duel with voldemort there were articles in the daily prophet heralding his valor in his duel against voldemort and harry had found himself in the front page also with stories from aurors about how harry had distracted voldemort just long enough for dumbledore to heal himself and resume the fight dumbledore had received praise in almost all of the newspapers but a few hinted that perhaps he was getting a bit too old for the fight harry had noticed that he did indeed seem very weary nowadays conjuring up a walking stick that he hobbled around on and during lessons he had always just given them instructions for dueling harry dueled against hermione now with dumbledore performing any necessary counter charms if a curse hit its target but all the same never leaving his chair it was depressing to see the old wizard so tired thankfully voldemort forces had died down after the attack after the loss voldemort forces must ve had extremely low morale and they had ceased any major attacks captured dark wizards were shipped off to a new wizard prison set up within the ministry of magic with their memories wiped their wands snapped harry had been to see dumbledore once and found that the order was doing as much as it could to keep voldemort forces at a low and he should go about enjoying himself for the holidays that were soon to come in fact he had received permission to go to the burrow with ron and ginny over the holidays however harry wasntin a position to think about that just now it was one week to christmas and the second quidditch game for gryffindor had begun he was speeding around the field dodging bludgers and watching blaise zabini the new slytherin seeker in case she went into a dive and saw the snitch he sped across the field having pleasure in making zabini jump up in fright and streak after him until he returned to his position above the play looking for a glint of gold that was the snitch down below he saw three scarlet blurs streak across the field tossing the quaffle to each other neville and seamus flanked ginny and as they approached the goalposts they flew in front of her with andrew and jack keeping the bludger away during practices it had been determined that ginny had the best arm for scoring out of all of the chasers and they had developed a new strategy to test on slytherin the frog hop sure enough it came ginny on her nimbus x shock all of a sudden tossed the ball to neville and seamus roared upwards and took the quaffle back from neville as he tossed it high up into the air the keeper who was sure that neville was going to shoot did not react in time when ginny sizzled a shot pass her into the center hoop lovely goal there by weasley gryffindor catching up 60 40 cried dean harry did a fancy twirl in delight and swooped past ginny and yelled that how it done gin and gave her a wink slytherin had started streaking down the field and crabbe and goyle whacked bludgers at ron ron had twisted in a complicated zigzag and dodged the bludgers but he couldntpull off the save the slytherin crowd roared in delight whilst the gryffindors moaned the hufflepuffs clapped apparently they were still upset with gryffindor for putting their captain in the hospital wing for two weeks and put him off the quidditch team for the rest of the year madam pomfrey had said that it was too dangerous for him to play anymore oh breakaway by ginny weasley she streaks up the pitch oh this could turn nasty two bludgers two beaters and slytherin keeper bulstrode streaks down to block her oh that got to hurt but wait ginny weasley scores the gryffindors were torn between yelling out in delight or moaning in sympathy ginny held her arms in the air signaling his need for a time out harry swooped down and called one you okay gin harry called ginny shook her head apparently she had rammed right into bulstrode and twisted around off the impact when she had twisted a bludger smashed into her back however biting through pain ginny had put the quaffle through the right hoop to bring the score to 70 50 ron observed ginny injury shit gin it swelling up okay your off gin good job go see madam pomfrey now no i not letting slytherin win said ginny grinding her teeth harry was truly impressed with ginny tough resolve ginny are you sure you re fine it your call but if i see you struggling you re going straight to the hospital wing wait a second harry pulled out his wand and waved it over ginny bruise a faint blue light went over it and it faded slightly that should make it a little bit better nothing like madam pomfrey of course but that is the best i can do thanks harry it ll do ron made the signal to madam hooch and the gryffindor quidditch team flew up into the air again twenty minutes later harry realized that ginny was definitely not okay she lagged behind and her face was wrenched in an expression of pain time called harry gin you re not okay c mon i taking you to the hospital wing dontbe ridiculous harry the team needs you i ll go myself no wait harry sped off into the stands where hermione sat with luna mione would you mind taking gin to the hospital wing he shouted no problem where is she harry pointed and sped back to his teammates hermione coming gin we ll wait with you until she gets here you did good ginny we re proud of you harry said the whole team agreed wholeheartedly even when ginny was injured she had scored two more goals and thanks to ron brilliant goalkeeping slytherin had scored none which brought the game to a tie hermione had arrived and led ginny out before she got out of hearing distance she turned around oh and go kick some slytherin arse guys dontlet me down with a wink the two girls disappeared off to the castle alright guys we re down a chaser here i ll get the snitch as soon as possible but for now we concentrate on defence make sure they dontget up by more than 140 points alright alright again the gryffindors took flight again however this time one player short very soon it had turned nasty without ginny gryffindor had basically no offence and they were one player short on defence suddenly in the nick of time harry saw the snitch the problem was blaise zabini had seen it too they dived blaise was closer to the snitch than harry but he had a better broom bit by bit harry had caught up to him the snitch flew to blaise side and harry decided that now wasnta time to be a gentleman as wood had put it in times long gone harry flipped to the other direction causing the tail of his broomstick to crash into blaise broom veering her off course harry with the better broom immediately dived after the snitch gryffindor captain has gone crazy he dives like a bullet towards the ground but wait wait oh my god he snatches the snitch out of the ground right before it hits and he somehow managed to avoid being crushed he got it he got the snitch gryffindor win 220 150 the crowd roared its delight even the ravenclaws who had just been applauding politely before then the slytherins hissed and the hufflepuffs merely walked away although some of them were applauding quite loudly themselves at harry spectacular dive harry was in the midst of celebrating with his teammates pumping his fist up and down still clutching the snitch in one hand his firebolt in another he saw two girls waving just inside the castle apparently hearing the noise that had been made signaling the end of the game harry tapped ron c mon gin and mione are waiting the two boys grabbed their brooms and sped off towards the castle leaving the still uproarious crowd behind hermione i take it you ll still come with me to the ball this christmas eve asked ron yawning as he said so one cold december night two days before christmas eve hermione sighed and said i guess what wrong why are you ron that wasntthe most romantic way of asking a girl to the ball you could think of was it asked ginny suggestively oh right well too bad it already past said ron and went back to his book about learning to be an animagus evidently unaware of hermione who had just gasped in disbelief at how ron couldnttake a hint she walked quickly out of the room up the staircases and a loud bang could be heard what up with her tonight asked ron oh you are so tactless cried ginny and she in turn walked out of the room and followed hermione must be that time of the month muttered ron under his breath ron what they re getting at is for you to ask hermione nicely to the ball it d make her feel more appreciated and not just taken for granted said harry wisely from behind his auror book that he had gotten from moody for his birthday but why i mean she already my girlfriend shouldnti just assume that we ll be going together take a lesson in girl psychology dontask me i ll never know said harry oh blimey forget it i ll make it up to her tomorrow you want a game of chess i ll take you up on that said ginny who had come back down if you dontmind of course harry oh not at all and may i say you look absolutely spanking gorgeous tonight miss weasley would you care to accompany me to the ball on christmas eve asked harry with a mock bow i d be delighted to mr potter ron burst out into a fit of laughter oh you two are so pathetic but that in a nutshell is how you ask a girl to the ball nicely ron said harry and watched the siblings get into a fiercely competitive game of chess ah mr potter delightful to see you again would you care to purchase another gift for your lady oh and just in time for christmas too said the short shopkeeper in the luxury jewelry store in hogsmeade he was nearly bouncing in delight in the anticipation of a big sale yes indeed mr autan this time i looking for something along the lines of a bracelet do you have any in stock why of course we have bracelets watches all sorts of things in fact a new product just came in today from the finest craftwizards of switzerland the shopkeeper waved his wand and two watches came flying out harry was immediately attracted to them it was made of a silvery colored substance was as strong as steel but was as light as a feather with a cool metallic feel around it you see mr potter during this war our customers have wanted a little bit more products that can err help defend oneself here let me demonstrate he led harry to a side room with a model of a woman wearing jewelry and strapped the watch on the model now get well out of the way mr potter wouldntwant to get hurt would we harry bristled a bit at the way of addressing him but obliged now stupefy the shopkeeper yelled aiming at the model a strange net of white light flew out of the watch and bounced the stunning curse straight back towards the shopkeeper and he had to dive out of the way to avoid it automatic protection you ll never get ambushed again plus should you be in a situation where you could not fight the watch can be automatically tuned into a portkey to take you to a specific place such as your home by the mere pressing of that button over there now this portkey is programmed to come straight to the front desk of my store watch he pressed the button and disappeared come here mr potter the shopkeeper called out the nice thing about this watch is that its magically branded to you and you alone so the witch or wizard that says the activation charm is the only person that can use the special effects that the watch has harry was amazed he had seen many useful gadgets in the seven years he had been in the wizarding world but none quite as useful as that there are also more functions in the instruction manual that comes with the watch that brilliant how much is it each two thousand galleons a bargain for you mr potter two thousand huh tell you what i d like to buy two of these one designed for males one designed for females but unfortunately i ve spent a lot more than i should on christmas presents so far and two more watches just really tips the scales half an hour later after a large amount of haggling harry left the shop with one check less but two very priceless watches in its stead harry had already gotten ron a new pair of keeper gloves hermione an encyclopedia of spells developed by ancient africans parvati because he had overheard the fact that she got him something a crystal ball luna a box of sugar quills and neville a jar of every flavor beans with ginny gift done and out of the way harry walked back to hogwarts harry had just crept out of the witch hump when ron had bumped right into him what were you oh god harry you bought presents said ron ron turned and thought for a second and exclaimed you didntbring me i was shopping for you too i couldntvery well bring you along too could i oh really what did you buy you re not finding out that easy now there still three hours before dinner if you hurry ron pushed harry out of the way and yelled dissendium before harry knew it ron had jumped down chuckling to himself harry went upstairs and placed down his purchases when he heard a fiery argument from inside the common room for the last time colin no i dontwant to go out with you i with harry oh yeah like the rest of the school population parvati and the likes of her shut up what do you know ginny i ve heard harry telling parvati listen i donthave time to listen to you make up lies yet you stay in school every day listening to harry s you realize that he just a bigheaded lunatic who steals the limelight from dumbledore because of some freak accident when he was a baby plus he just using you to make himself look even better i bet he doesntcare for you at all you know what i learnt when malfoy put the imperius on me i could access some of his memories when he let me did you know that harry is colin uttered a long string of insults a loud slap was heard dontinsult harry you little death eater he worth a hundred of you he doesnteven love you ginny i do you know i do we were great together people voted us the sweetest couple in the school ha realized that you missed your chance need a decent girl to cheer you re stinking death eater self up and how do you love me hermione told me how harry had thrown off the imperius curse in his fourth year he did it because of a strong will everyone said if you had a strong will and you actually had any feelings for me you would ve i ve realized that watching for months famous perfect potter grope you in the hallways just how much you actually meant to me plus you know it deep down you love me as much as i love you how dare you you know you want me too ginny harry heard ginny laugh never in a million years would i ever want you colin not anymore ginny if you like potter because of his so called powerful self and you re sure he d protect you you re all wrong remus lupin was killed because of potter they killed him because he was friends with potter dad but i could easily get someone to put another imperius on me i could be just as strong as potter any day is this what it all about colin you had a taste of power under malfoy imperius curse and you want more that is just pathetic absolutely pathetic giving up your free will for a bit more power even death eaters dontsink that low no of course not i want you ginny we were meant to be together we fit each other perfectly and if power is what i need to get you dontgive me that loud of dung get out of here colin when you had come to talk before i thought it was because you were dealing with your conscience so i tried to be nice and understanding despite the fact that just being around you gives me an uneasy feeling but to think that you actually enjoyed the time under the imperius you are without a doubt the most low down pathetic excuse for a gryffindor i ever seen fine i ve had it with you i should ve known that all you were was a little poor girl who just grabs her chance with the great famous potter to get herself some money and gifts say how much does he pay you harry walked in his green eyes alight with fury twenty points from gryffindor for insulting a fellow prefect and the head boy and being off bounds and if i ever hear you utter foul words out of your stinking mouth about ginny ron or any weasleys again you ll get what the rest of the scum that served voldemort get i dontcare if you were under the imperius or not it doesntgive you an excuse to start trying to recruit others to the cause oh and if i ever see you in the head boy dorm again i will personally ensure that you are expelled now i ll be seeing dumbledore about your suspension that is assuming you ve only been here twice but if you ve been here a third time well you know what happens now get out before i lose my temper harry said calmly although his expression betrayed his already imminent anger you i cantbelieve you when will the wizarding world wake up and that it creevey we re going to the headmaster jumping on colin harry activated his portkey that took him to dumbledore office he felt the familiar tug and the next second he was in dumbledore office straightening himself professor dumbledore colin creevey was out of bounds and from what i ve heard this isnthis first time started harry who broke off after the sight of the headmaster slumped in a chair seemingly motionless what oh hello harry colin said dumbledore who had immediately snapped to attention harry gave dumbledore an inquiring look but dumbledore immediately shook his head well colin here was out of bounds in the head boy common room and i ve heard through his and ginny conversation this isntthe first time i do believe being out of bounds calls for a punishment yes yes dumbledore stood and threw a handful of floo powder into the fire saying minerva mcgonagall mcgonagall face appeared in the fire a few minutes saying oh albus do you need anything another potion no no minerva we have a problem with a student being out of bounds i ll be there in a second mcgonagall appeared out of the fire and straightened potter creevey or both creevey minerva now if you dontmind i ll be going much to do feel free to use my office thank you headmaster now what is the problem expelled awesome way to use your head boy powers who did you expel exclaimed ron at dinner i didntrat on him for no reason who colin creevey but he was on the imperius not for that and so harry explained to ron and hermione how colin had been talking to ginny and how he had insulted her and i ll be damned if i let someone insult me and my girlfriend for no reason at all and get away with it plus i ve had enough look things just happen to me all the time and i not going to let anything bad that is short of inevitable to happen to me totally agree with you mate i would ve done more than you harry i would ve i glad to see you re taking your responsibility seriously harry i should ve known you d be a great head boy at least you two both approve even if it in different ways harry smiled and slung his arms around his two best friends walking out of the great hall harry noticed that ginny was nowhere to be seen and he decided maybe she needed some alone time for whatever reason an hour later after visiting hagrid with ron and hermione harry said c mon i haventseen ginny for a while lets go and check the marauder map walking back into harry dorm he took out the old piece of parchment i solemnly swear i am up to no good the marauder map activated and harry immediately spotted ginny in the marauder room alone i know where she is i going to go see her you two can stay if you want ron and hermione nodded harry grabbing his invisibility cloak disappeared and walked out of the dorm harry little mysticat jumped on his shoulder it must ve been able to see through invisibility cloaks re adjusting the invisibility cloak so it covered the mysticat he climbed out the portrait hole and headed to the marauder room he didntwant anyone to find out the location of the room he found her sitting alone calmly looking into the fireplace with prongs song on harry stood silently for a while watching ginny as the light flickering from the fire illuminated her fiery red hair her freckles and her eyes the mysticat purred softly and jumped off harry shoulder starting to look around the room whispering prongs to close the hole harry walked over and pulled ginny into a hug she jerked at first but then relaxed into the hug you re beautiful ginny you know that dontyou ginny smirked up at him do you want to kiss me or something trick question huh but i was serious you re you re ginny you know colin was totally lying dontyou i mean i you know i got him expelled you dontmind do you said harry very fast not at all like his usual self i ll take that as a yes ginny pulled harry face down to hers and kissed him lightly when they broke apart harry looked deep into ginny eyes he now felt what he had felt that summer night magnified a few times harry hesitated for just one second and voiced what he had been thinking of saying for a few months now ginny what i want to say is i well i love you ginny smiled a genuine lit from within smile i love you too you do know that i always have but i couldntjust wait for you forever if i had done that you d still be oblivious to me but that not very fair you cantjust harry shut up they kissed again so what did you get hermione ron no way i not about to tell you this time fine fine why is it that we re always down here half an hour before they are they re girls they take a long time to dress up mind you it worth it even ginny looked okay that not very nice bollocks i just gave her a compliment ron you re more thick skulled than i am when it comes to dishing out compliments whatever bighead thick skull bighead thick skull bighead harry stopped and smiled what ginny ginny had her hair twisted up into an elegant knot at the top of her head and she was wearing the same silver white robes she had wore for the halloween ball harry necklace and she had taken it to put glitter on her face oh hi ginny where hermione why are there dots all over your face and why is your hair ridiculously like that i think you look gorgeous said harry walking over to ginny handing her a bouquet of ever lasting roses and sliding his arm around her waist shut up potter and stop eying my little sister she my girlfriend she my sister i both so please stop fighting over me said ginny although she was smiling oh and here comes your princess ronniekins shut up hi hermione you look lovely tonight shut up weasley and stop eying my best friend she my girlfriend she practically my sister shut up harry yelled ron and ginny okay okay the four students made their way down to the great hall and were surprised that there was hardly any space and that music was already blasting oh yeah everyone allowed at this ball said hermione right well lets go find a table unless you d like to dance first you bet ron and hermione went off by themselves leaving harry and ginny alone harry led ginny into the center of the dance floor when something very strange happened all students get to your common rooms roared dumbledore without giving an explanation first years shrieked second years turned their heads around frantically third and fourth years ran out of the hall fifth and sixth years were trying to calm down the youngest students and force them to leave harry saw dumbledore talking very fast to snape and mcgonagall he started to walk over but dumbledore shook his head muttering something dumbledore sent a jet of silver light towards harry harry didntdodge it he knew he could trust dumbledore there something in the castle stay in the head boy dorm do not leave unless there is imminent danger we dontknow what it is but something set off the wards go harry nodded and pulled ginny quickly towards ron and hermione something is in the castle we re not to help under any circumstances come on whispered harry hurriedly they ran quickly to the head boy room panting slightly when they reached the portrait hole and scrambled in harry mysticat purred as they walked in immediately jumping onto harry shoulder an hour long the four friends sat in a circle waiting waiting for any news whether good or bad until they couldntstand it any more did they forget about us or something yawned ron harry was still clutching his wand his eyes still staring a hole into the portrait hole when mcgonagall head finally appeared in the fireplace we found nothing great nothing got in then exclaimed ron no it isn t is it professor said hermione thoughtfully no indeed miss granger the hogwarts wards dontmalfunction they were placed upon the grounds by the founders themselves so what does this mean asked ginny it means something is in hogwarts they arentshowing themselves yet but we know they re there what are we going to do questioned harry we re not going to do anything all four of you will return to grimmauld place for christmas tonight in thirty minutes the school is being evacuated for the holidays for further inspection bring all your belongings and come down to the great hall in half an hour yes professor they scrambled for their trunks and forty five minutes later courtesy of a portkey they were in grimmauld place face to face with the weasleys and the grangers harry watched with a twinge of jealously at the two families which were embracing their children hermione saw harry standing alone and quickly pulled him to her and her family i know what you re thinking harry but you cantunderstand harry stopped he didntwant to be one to moan all the time but i can help if you let me i love you harry you re my brother and it doesntmatter if you werent born as my brother or even if you consider yourself to be you ll still be my brother my family you might not have your blood family with you but you have family all the same harry was touched he had never appreciated hermione as much as he did then as he watched the weasleys happily talking to each other with grins on their faces harry nodded thanks hermione sis hermione smiled and hugged him that what i here for in an invisible mansion in la havre france voldemort gathered his elite death eaters thirteen of them tell peter and bella to set up a portkey detection and redirection charm over hogwarts i believe its time we set a trap for young potter again pacing around and glaring each of his faithful death eaters in the eye voldemort asked what of your father draco no success my lord two year olds are more charismatic than he is he cannot take care of himself at all he basically a forty eight year old infant mother is taking care of him the best she can and

this valuable position feel free to kill either dumbledore or potter if an opportunity arises return to the dark forest and await further orders yes master voldemort stood and hissed to the giant snake next to him it all coming together nagini by the second week of the new year you shall feed on potter corpse twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twelve presents and surprises wow that was amazing said ron as they went to sleep that night the one month trip back to his parents time had certainly been interesting harry had caught up with remus sirius james and lily telling them about everything that happened in the future harry ron ginny remus sirius and james had played quidditch in the backyard of godric hollow every day ron was so happy because sirius and james had taught him quite a few tricks ron was practically bouncing in anticipation of the gryffindor vs ravenclaw match that would come at the end of the year when they got back lily and james had treated hermione ron and ginny as their own children james especially had a certain fondness for ginny harry had laughed as he knew then that he was indeed his father son the sirius of 1980 had liked ron the most they spent every day laughing and discussing quidditch it turned out sirius had also supported the chudley cannons lily on the other hand preferred hermione quick wit and her strong nature the previous one month trip had allowed them to become good friends and they remained that way on this trip remus lupin had visited quite a few times and harry was amazed at how different remus was in 1980 he did not look old or tired despite his lycanthrope condition harry guessed that it must ve been the thirteen years he lived without his friends believing them all to be dead or traitors that had turned the handsome man into the long suffering tired man that harry had known one month away from all the terror going on in the world and harry had felt perfectly ready to take anything that voldemort could throw at him he was rejuvenated spending another month with his family both blood and friendship families harry family had decided on a name for his little mysticat fortuna for luck of course in their timeline just one minute had passed and they were still in the position they were in before they left hogwarts had been infiltrated with something or someone and voldemort was gathering power once again as mr weasley had told them harry had gone to sleep that night with a smile on his face however as he thought happily of the month spent with his family the next morning was just as cheerful harry was awoken by a jet of water sent into his face by ron who on his now grown up face had a grin of childish delight presents he yelled harry sprung up pulled on a pair of jeans and a black top and ran headfirst out of the room with ron tailing him loud footsteps behind them meant ginny and hermione were there too ron pushed past harry and ran towards his magically enlarged stocking hanging over the fireplace in the living room which held all his presents accio stocking cried a voice harry and ron whipped around as the stocking flew away from ron outstretched hands and into the hands of molly weasley wait until everyone else is here ronald scolded mrs weasley arthur bill charlie percy come down its time to open presents yes mum called three voices and arthur weasley was already behind mrs weasley by the time she finished calling hermione dear would you mind calling your parents hermione ran up the stairs and a few minutes later came bounding back into the room with her parents looking very tired behind her alright we re all here time to start opening presents eldest first i say okay said mrs weasley harry watched happily as mr and mrs weasley opened a present from him a large album of paintings by the esteemed painting megan wartmeyer and a bicycle for mr weasley to experiment with the weasley parents beamed at harry and offered their thanks it turned out that everyone had thought to get the weasley parents either a book or some form of art which they appreciated all the same but by the last present from percy arthur weasley smile had started to look a bit tired next was mr and mrs granger harry had gotten them a present from the 1980s popular music section when he had traveled back in time to meet his parents he thought they d appreciate it seeing as they were from that era harry noticed that the grangers had a significant amount less of presents than the weasleys mr and mrs weasley had gotten them a present hermione and harry had but none of the other weasleys had thought of it harry knew that their muggle friends wouldntbe able to find mr and mrs granger now that they had sacrificed their daily lives for their and hermione s safety the weasley brothers had gotten quite normal presents like quills and candy although fred and george weasley did in fact get a massive box from zonko they were thanking the twins for the inspiration they brought to the world of magical entertainment everyone had smirked at that when ron opened his keeper gloves from harry he gasped and held them up dancing around and insisting to everyone that they go outside and play quidditch right away so he could test his keeper gloves absolutely not go on ronald open hermione present harry leaned forwards this was the part he was looking forward to ginny had told him about hermione spending days and nights making a present for ron okay mum ron ripped open the wrapping unceremoniously and took out what looked like a fang attached to a gold chain do you like it asked hermione hopefully yeah thanks hermione but what is it it a saber tooth tiger fang its supposed to have a lot of magical properties like i love it hermione thanks interrupted ron hermione looked rather taken aback but gave ron a hug anyway harry stood up and grinned it was his turn first he opened a present from tonks who couldntbe at grimmauld place but sent a present along anyway he opened it and found a bottle of dr sleezey hair tamer and a note dear harry merry christmas i hope you enjoy this hair potion its one of the newest on the market i reckon it ll even work with your hair use it on a special occasion tonks harry smirked tonks had just inadvertently insulted his hair but he thanked her for providing a solution to it next was a dragon hide wand holster from ron which harry tried on immediately finding it was feather light harry thanked ron and he said no problem its nothing compared to these gloves wow and ron went back to examining his brand new black gloves open mine squealed hermione harry opened it and not to his surprise he found a book however to his surprise it wasntany old book it was a diary hermione motioned for him to open the diary and as harry did so a note fell out dear harry this is an account of all the adventures we ve had together and all the memories good and bad of our friendship i hope you ll add to it and one day let me read it too i hope you enjoy it and merry christmas love sis harry again was touched he smiled at the thoughtfulness of the present and how hermione had signed it sis she nodded at him with a smile and he grinned back at her harry thought back to the bossy eleven year old hermione used to be and he thought to himself that he d never have thought hermione could be so sweet to him harry oh sorry harry opened the next present a set of navy blue dress robes from mr and mrs weasley harry nodded his thanks and opened the present from bill and charlie a silver pocketknife it supposed to be able to cut into anything dead useful for aurors thought you might need it one day thanks bill thanks charlie harry opened the next few presents from neville luna mr and mrs granger and percy which all contained various sweets and harry found himself with a large boxful of sweets at the end harry then looked to the last two presents both in small boxes harry opened a box first and found it was from parvati it was a bottle of muggle cologne and a pair of contact lenses with a short note wishing him a happy christmas harry hoped that parvati was pleased with his gift she must ve gone through a lot of trouble to go into the muggle world to buy harry those presents harry looked to the second box and decided it must be from ginny he tore open the wrapping gently and looked inside it was a plain silver ring it was attractive but not flashy he opened the note that was next to the ring harry a ring represents my love for you its simple but pure it encircles me forever and it has no beginning and no end wear this always if you feel the same way forever yours ginny harry grinned at her and immediately placed the ring around his finger harry walked over to ginny and kissed her on the cheek oblivious to everyone else there potter get off my sister yelled fred and george and percy bill and charlie made no response they had heard that harry and ginny were together shut up percy fred george i going out with harry its alright but george said mr weasley in a scolding tone okay okay anyway thanks gin i love it sure harry is that the last present yeah my turn yelled hermione and she dived into her pile of presents she came out with harry first as she ripped apart the wrapping hermione squealed in delight wow harry how did you know that i didnthave this book easy there are only a hundred copies in the world i ordered it from hogsmeade they got it from egypt really wow i love it thanks bro glad you like it sis hermione set harry present gingerly down on the coffee table next to the long red sofa that harry ginny ron and hermione sat on hermione ripped open a few more presents books on random things from arithmancy to chemistry from mr and mrs granger as they were used to buying muggle books for their only daughter harry had to stop himself from laughing every single present was a book so far besides a box full of wizard wheezes from fred and george finally after taking out ginny present jinxes for the witch at war she opened the last package which harry knew by process of elimination was from ron hermione was grinning in anticipation as she slowly ripped off the wrapping she seemed to be trembling but still teasing herself by opening it slowly ron watched with a wide smile across his face hermione opened the package not to find a book not to find jewelry but to find a bottle of butterbeer and a white rose she immediately pushed the butterbeer away impatiently and picked up the rose hermione must ve expected something special to happen but nothing did it was just a rose a beautiful rose but a plain rose nonetheless err thanks ron ron beamed apparently unaware of the incredulous looks ginny harry bill and charlie were giving him hermione was obviously very disappointed gifts from everyone even percy had been better than ron s there were bottles of butterbeer everywhere around grimmauld place and the rose showed nothing interesting it wasntespecially beautiful ron obviously thought his gift was remarkably romantic as he was still beaming and he slung his arm around hermione she looked as if she wanted to shake him off okay ginny turn ginny cheered and immediately opened her presents a necklace from arthur and molly weasley a variety of wizard wheezes from fred and george a bottle of perfume from bill and charlie a new owl from hermione who had just flown in as ginny opened ron present a chudley cannons book she had finally come to harry present and harry watched in nervous anticipation he observed how she was like hermione unwrapping the package slowly a lock of bright red hair falling in her eyes but she left it there as she squinted to see what it was until she couldnttake it anymore and ripped off the wrapping paper altogether a quiet gasp went throughout the room as they looked at the beautiful watch inside a solid crystal case wow its beautiful harry ginny sighed d ya d ya like it like it i love it cried ginny and started to place it on no wait gin it more than just a watch you have to say the activation charm its in the user manual second page to brand it to you it a protective item not just a pretty watch read about it when you have some time but now activate it okay it says boomslang skin the watched glowed silver for a second and found itself attached onto ginny wrist fred or george had started to murmur at this obviously discussing how much it cost harry here for a short demonstration may i asked harry okay but what do i do just stand there and dontdodge my spell okay expelliarmus said harry softly sending a jet of red light to ginny instead of the white net of light that came out of the shopkeeper watch to reflect the spell an orange net flew out of ginny watch and the spell flew straight back at harry and he found his wand flying out of his hand and into ginny s just like that wow murmured multiple voices in shock and it so beautiful too what it made of harry oh something like titanium and silver i dontremember its wonderful harry thank you so much okay okay enough of the mushy stuff lets go play some quidditch yelled ron now boys you mustntfly too high the protective wards only go so far ron nodded and ran out of the room charlie fred george and bill following him quickly percy walking up the stairs apparently not joining his brothers leaving harry hermione and ginny behind shall we go then asked harry however his mind was far from quidditch yet again he found himself itching to run his hands through ginny silky red hair yeah listen harry i serious thank you so much for that watch i so lucky to have such a considerate boyfriend hermione made a strangled sound and ran out of the room oh shit i didntmean to remind her of ron said ginny dontworry i ll fix it go outside and play harry brushed his lips across her cheek and ran to find hermione who was sitting on her bed silently fuming with tears welling up in her eyes sis go away harry i want to be alone no if i your brother than i going to damn well act like it hermione i ll talk to ron today okay just cheer up please it christmas he so hopeless that was embarrassing you know you go off and buy ginny the best gift a girl could possibly want and ron comes along with a dented bottle of butterbeer and a stinky three day old rose it not fair shh harry whispered quietly and sat down next to hermione i ll get you one too if you want sis harry that not the point ron doesntcare about me at all he comes and probably conjures up the stinking rose and takes the butterbeer from under his bed but hermione i sure he does care he did go to hogsmeade to buy those two things harry hermione said her voice dropping down to an extremely quiet whisper i saw him with lavender what i said i saw him with lavender the day before he asked me to the christmas ball they were holding hands and laughing but damn straight he was probably just doing that as a friend you know they did get to know each other a bit after you two broke up the first time harry stop siding with ron it doesnt matter if it was just as a friend i dontlike it actually hermione i think you re right i ll have a word with ron after lunch on one condition though what you cheer up and have a nice snowball fight on broomsticks with us hermione pretended to think about it then said deal harry pulled hermione up and pushed her out of her room grabbing her broom on the way summoning his broom from next door the two friends walked down finally there you two are okay let make teams shouted ron the weasleys flew down and they immediately suggested charlie and harry as captains as they were the seekers hermione objected we cantfly too high so they cantbe seekers the wards only go fine fine whatever hermione they ll be chasers then we ll play up to 300 hermione looked like she was about to say something but restrained from doing so you pick first harry said charlie as he climbed onto his broomstick and lifted up sure i pick ginny said harry hovering above ron fred george hermione bill and ginny ginny grinned and joined harry hovering in the air i take bill i take ron i take george harry who was still hovering above them watched as fred was mounting his broom certain harry would choose him over hermione she could barely fly properly and by the slightly disappointed unhappy look on her face she knew it i take hermione what exclaimed seven voices including hermione but i never get picked she stuttered c mon mione sibs gotta stick together now c mon lets get a game plan together fred looked outraged as he flew to join george bill and charlie who were laughing heartily at fred being beaten by hermione alright forget any game plan hermione me and ginny are chasers ron you re keeper alright c mon let play already hollered george harry team launched up and flew into formation and the four on four quidditch game blew into action harry was at his prime as a seeker but he sure wasntbad as a chaser harry flew mainly with ginny as hermione on ginny old comet couldntkeep up with ginny nimbus and was far out of its league when comparing with harry firebolt the weasleys harry and hermione had an hour and a half of fun zipping around on broomsticks hermione was still going just a few meters above the ground and at an annoyingly slow pace and harry team which was practically short handed lost 300 220 fred had joked with harry for his poor choice in teammate on the way back to their rooms in grimmauld place heading for lunch harry merely gave fred a deaf man smile and with a wave slung his arm around ginny and walked up the first flight of stairs together at harry and ron room harry and ginny broke apart harry going in to take a shower and ginny proceeding to the shared room between her and hermione before harry had walked in though hermione had pulled him by the arm thanks harry i know its just a game and i know i no good at quidditch thanks for choosing me anyway i appreciate it said hermione quite nervously harry thought anytime sis anytime come on now get ready professor dumbledore expects you all in by 11 30 called mrs weasley the christmas holidays were over and it was time to return to hogwarts apparently dumbledore decided that whatever entered the school was probably just a creature of some sort no real threat to the school harry now stood in the living room of grimmauld place after being hugged by mrs weasley he watched hermione hug her parents tightly ron and ginny being fussed about by their parents and brothers fortuna leaped onto harry shoulder and he stroked him lightly harry was surprised to see that fortuna big feline green eyes looked strange almost as if it looked extremely worried about something fortuna let out a soft meow and harry hugged his beautiful little mysticat tightly harry had a strange feeling of foreboding but shook it off as hermione broke apart and came over to him they waited as ron and ginny made their goodbyes ten minutes later ron and ginny were ready to leave mrs weasley had tears in her eyes as she fussed about the state of ron collar and ginny hair got your portkeys sniffed mrs weasley mr and mrs granger hugged hermione once again yes mum said ron and ginny holding up a weasley sweater that was the portkey yes mrs weasley said harry and hermione holding up a goblet that was theirs okay in three two one with an almighty tug four students disappeared from grimmauld place two of them arrived in hogwarts twilight evabandmamber13 chapter thirteen riddle mansion harry and hermione landed in the now familiar office of albus dumbledore straightening up and greeting the old wizard who waited for them with a weak smile looking around harry noticed that ron and ginny had not yet appeared where are they shouldntthey be here at the same time dumbledore sprung up did they leave at the same time as you yes answered hermione dumbledore frowned i must ve programmed the portkey wrong what whispered harry in a dangerous tone hermione grabbed his arm she knew what was happening she had only heard harry like this once in sixth year when malfoy had transfigured ginny hair into live snakes and scared the living daylights out of her hermione remembered harry roar of anger and she especially remembered the simple stunning charm that had not only knocked malfoy out but knocked him with such force he flew backwards and actually splintered professor flitwick classroom door with his body on impact hermione was scared not actually for harry getting expelled no not what any one of harry friends would fear at this point she feared that dumbledore would get hurt he looked awfully thin and frail and harry had a spark of anger in his eyes a slightest provocation would cause an explosion i believe i may have dammit for all we know they could be anywhere shouted harry dumbledore sighed and sat down harry portkey programming may seem simple with a simple incantation but the actual making requires a great strength of mind to we donthave time for this we have to find ron and ginny they might not be safe cried harry almost jumping in frustration relax harry ron and ginny are probably in hogwarts most likely the head boy and girl common room i couldnthave made much bigger a mistake have no worries said dumbledore harry and hermione exhaled in relief sorry professor its just that given the state of the wizarding world now well if you dontmind professor we ll be going now yes yes run along now you two harry and hermione walked slowly back to the common room greeting a few rather timid looking second years on the way there beauty rest said hermione at the portrait hole ginnnnnnnnnnnnny hollered harry and ron he added as an afterthought no response must be in one of the rooms you check yours i ll check mine harry walked up the left staircase calling out ron but receiving no reply harry decided that they must ve gone to the kitchens or hagrid hut or the quidditch field and went back downstairs to meet hermione harry didntnotice that ron trunk wasntthere they arenthere hermione they probably went for a walk or something let just have a game of chess while we wait for them said harry sitting down to the chessboard at his desk hermione sat down opposite harry and they started a game of chess an hour and a half later when the chessboard had just four pieces left on it harry began to get a bit worried where do you think they ve gone to dunno why dontyou go check the marauder map replied hermione who was still staring at the chessboard with a look of concentration on her face accio marauder map said harry lazily the crumpled bit of parchment flew from his room straight into his hand i solemnly swear that i am up to no good harry surveyed the map slowly his expression gradually looking worse and worse hermione they arenthere harry where do you think you are going asked dumbledore looking scandalized stumbling on his walking stick to keep up with harry and hermione who were sweeping out of his office after telling him that ginny and ron were gone to find ginny and ron how can you do that i have a tracker on ginny watch to use in case we ever needed to find each other it lets me sense if she nearby by pressing this button on my watch it too dangerous wait for some aurors to go harry stopped in his tracks no disrespect intended headmaster but you arentstopping me from going no this is my best friend and my girlfriend i not staying out of this one i forbid you that may be your choice but i cannot allow you to lead a fellow student with you too professor dumbledore i not going for harry sake i going because i must nothing is going to stop me either said hermione harry stood still and pondered for a moment hermione maybe he right though its too dangerous harry i can take care of myself just as well as you can but you d be risking your life if i dontgo there more a chance that you ginny and ron will lose yours but no buts harry fine fine we donthave time for this harry immediately broke into a run for the fireplace in his dorm with dumbledore and hermione in his tracks dumbledore breathing heavily students observing this scene would be very amused in seeing their headmaster tail harry and seem to be begging a student professor dumbledore you must stay at hogwarts in case of an attack whilst we re gone this could be a trap but do contact fudge and see if he can send some kind of diversion muttered harry as he grabbed a handful of floo powder from above the fireplace and through it in wait harry wherever voldemort is you cantmerely floo in i know that why i going to the next best place accio firebolt accio invisibility cloak harry caught the firebolt in his free hand and tossed the floo powder into the fireplace harry then caught the speeding silvery cloak with his hand that had just held the floo powder and walked into the green flames harry you just said it yourself this is probably a trap a trap for the sole purpose of snaring you harry turned and looked dumbledore in the eye with unfathomable emotion in his eyes that why i have to go it my fault ron and ginny are there it ll be my fault if they die but what about hermione harry you do not realize that you are leading her into danger i know hermione by now after seven years of her being my best friend i know that no matter what i do she will not be left behind it is also her choice to go if she wishes although if it were up to me she would not be going i promise you though professor hermione will not be hurt not whilst i alive the invisibility cloak is for her invisibility cloaks will do no good you may cause her death harry dontgo cried dumbledore in a last ditch attempt to stop harry from leaving hermione was shocked at how dumbledore now had to resort to emotional blackmail to try and stop harry hermione understood dumbledore frustration how he must stay in hogwarts whilst he watches one of the strongest wizards ever almost strong enough to rival dumbledore himself to step into hogwarts walk into a trap and bringing with him the best student since tom riddle the old wizard cared deeply for them but also in his heart knew there was nothing he could do to stop harry harry with a tortured look in his on his face said then keep her here i must go i have no choice pistols pub la havre harry whispered and disappeared in a whirl of green flame dumbledore held out his hand blocking hermione path hermione if you insist on going take care of yourself and harry if you need here another portkey i will do my best to assure you that you get someone there to help you now it is the clearing in the mountain path east of la havre correct good luck dear hermione dumbledore pulled out a green bottle cap the grown wizard looked as if he was about to cry hermione immediately felt a surge of emotion towards the old wizard he treated harry like a son and her like a daughter he truly was a great headmaster thank you professor hermione noted the massive change in dumbledore two years ago he never would ve allowed harry or hermione to leave but now it seemed as if he wouldn t or couldntcare anymore hermione feared greatly for dumbledore as she walked up to the fireplace and threw another handful of floo powder in pistols pub la havre hermione tumbled out of the fireplace in a very dirty musty old pub being pulled up by harry the two walked out of the pub not noticing a man with a long gash across his face quickly scarper out ahead of them where are we going harry hang on there harry pointed at a clearing far away from the little town they were in now there nothing there that hermione is voldemort hideout my watch is pointing there and there something that just seems wrong about there the watch points to where ginny is so she should be there c mon get under the cloak but how do you know all this harry why do you know there something there this town is where remus lupin lived during the first war i visited him last time we went to see my parents and i remember there was something over there without another word harry swung the cloak over himself and hermione and they made their way slowly to the clearing on harry firebolt until harry closed his eyes and laid his hands onto a plank it looked like he was pressing on thin air until hermione felt what harry was pushing against no time for pleasantries said harry climbing out from under the cloak you stay down there no need for them to know you re here now i going to cause a little trouble find ginny and ron their in some kind of underground basement according to my watch i can sense them i ll draw them away you creep down and portkey them back to hogwarts okay once we re in the house you should be able to see everything but harry didntwait reducto he bellowed shattering the front door which in turn exposed the whole of the house which harry saw was massive good luck hermione he said and he strode purposefully into the lair of lord voldemort master potter is here shouted someone harry silenced him with a rapid fire stunning spell and felt hermione slide past him by now death eaters had gathered in voldemort throne room waiting for harry to make his way in harry knew already that it was a trap but he had no choice but to continue he heard voices shouting out spells harry assumed that the defences were being raised again he walked up to the strange door that had live snakes crawling all over it and hissed open slowly but surely the door cracked open banisho serpents voldemort snakes disappeared and harry walked into the throne room where he felt dark forces gather ah here he is my loyal death eaters potter voldemort spat out the last word in disgust harry refrained from clutching at his burning scar but clutched his wand tight with the spare wand hidden securely in his holster and shouted aloud i am here for my friends voldemort hermione snuck down to the dungeons only barely hearing voices shouting above her riddle mansion was a curious place cold green and dark in every single room and hallway snakes commonly slithered about the halls and hermione shuddered to think that they could smell her yet they left her alone so she proceeded silently to the dungeons down low sliding through the open door and walking down the cold stone steps with nothing but a torchlight down at the bottom to guide her when hermione reached the bottom of the staircase the sight before her almost made her gasp stuck inside riddle mansion was indeed ron and ginny weasley both looking worse for wear a nearly skeletal cornelius fudge four dead wizards plopped carelessly against a wall an old witch hermione didntknow that was practically a skeleton and victor krum hermione had not seen krum since her fourth year and had only sent him one letter to explain that their relationship was over she never received a reply krum looked helpless lying there on the floor blood splattered all over his black robes his face an empty expression he looked as if he gave up all hope already what the death eaters kept krum alive for hermione did not know and certainly did not want to find out but krum not to mention fudge presence put hermione into a difficult position indeed her original intentions were to come in and grab ron and ginny and portkey away without anyone noticing she was there she still could do that but that would mean leaving fudge and krum lying there probably to be killed once the death eaters sniffed out what had happened hermione also did not have time to think there were three death eaters patrolling the dungeon and hermione with an expression of horror creeping up on her face realized one was draco malfoy hermione knew all too well that those magical eyes could see through invisibility cloaks she had merely seconds to think up a plan for surely malfoy would turn to her direction soon she could either sprint to ron and ginny portkey them out and alert dumbledore or she could knock malfoy out and try to beat those two other death eater guards but surely they d raise an alarm before she reached them all if she reached them all she had no choice but to try and rescue ron and ginny she had already tempted luck too long malfoy would soon see her she ran as fast as she could without making too loud a noise up to the dirty corner where the weasley siblings clutched at each other for warmth wandless hermione saw that ginny still had harry watch on her wrist malfoy and the other two death eaters were deep in conversation practically ignoring their prisoners that how confident they were in their master plan hermione reached the corner and swept the invisibility cloak over ron and ginny also the three of them barely fitting and placing a hand over ron mouth to get him to stop from saying something she grabbed out the bottle cap waved her wand over it and motioned for ron and ginny to touch it she found that they couldn t and she realized that they were under the full body bind she muttered the counter curse and the two siblings found that they could move again hermione put a finger to her lips and motioned again for them to touch the bottle cap they did tiredly and hermione shouted activatio there was no tugging sensation that she had grown accustomed to however ron and ginny were gone she observed thankful for that at the very least she also noticed that the invisibility cloak was gone numbly hermione knew that her time was up as shouts from the three death eaters let her know that they were aware of her presence she regretted that she had shouted the spell to activate the portkey slowly and dumbly she raised her wand in an attempt to defend herself avada ke no goyle shouted malfoy knocking goyle wand out of his hand do not harm her the dark lord may have uses for this one yet stun her and we will bring her up to the throne room i must remind the dark lord to recast the anti apparition and portkey wards and the defences damned would she be if hermione granger let the father of the blundering git goyle best her in a duel as she heard the word stupefy come out of the large man mouth she dodged the beam and yelled skeledestructo hermione watched horrified as the beam of light smacked goyle in the head making him crumple to the floor all the bones in his upper body removed she had killed someone she thought hopelessly she was going to be sent to azkaban herm own ninny said victor krum staring at hermione with wide eyes it was all absolutely meaningless to hermione she had just killed someone she was a murderer hermione let out a small whimper shaking in fright she didnteven raise her wand to defend herself as a jet of light smacked her straight in the stomach and for hermione granger all went black harry was in trouble he was outnumbered about twenty to one and he had only avoided curses by controlling death eaters and causing them to jump into the curses cast by their own comrades and by creating illusionary copies of himself with a neat little charm dumbledore had taught him minor curses such as stunning spells and freezing hexes bounced off the bright green net that flew out of his watch so far four death eaters were immobilized or killed but it meant nothing he was still outnumbered and he still stood no chance he dared not run or else they would chase after him and hermione mission might be compromised he had to hold them off until they escaped and then he d portkey out what was worse was that his scar felt like it was ripping his head open torrentoria flamare harry shouted pointing his wand above voldemort throne death eaters dived for cover as fire rained down upon them avada kedavra he heard voldemort shriek an illusionary copy was hit shimmered and disappeared voldemort stood and waved his wand the illusionary copies disappeared and the death eaters he had under the imperius snapped out of it harry swore loudly leave him to me it about time we finally snare the illusive potter death eaters chuckled appreciatively as voldemort brandished his wand voldemort face contorted from his disgusting twisted smile into an expression of hatred goodbye potter avada kedavra harry dived down to avoid the curse and at that moment he felt in his heart that ginny had gotten away harry felt a surge of elation surge through him with a smile on his face he tapped his watch and said goodbye riddle activatio he felt the jerk on his stomach but he didntgo anywhere were you expecting to get away that easily potter harry spat but inwardly he began to worry ginny had obviously portkeyed out he couldntsense her in the house anymore through the watch which meant she was gone unless they broke the watch harry drew himself up to his full height preparing to die a hero death avada kedavra shouted voldemort again skeledestructo the beams of light hit harry and voldemort flew up into the air again but this time harry was ready he whipped out his spare wand and bellowed avada kedavra he watched with a sick satisfaction as the green light smacked voldemort straight in the chest sending him flying across the room he let out a laugh at the death eaters who yelled and gathered around their master fallen body which had smacked into the wall and lain in a heap but voldemort stood again harry laugh was taken right out of his mouth and turned into a gasp of disbelief voldemort just took a killing curse straight in the stomach and stood up seconds after it hit it was impossible harry just stood unmoving disbelieving crucio harry doubled over in pain clutching the cold floor with his fingernails yelling out in agony and begging for death this time it was not just physical pain like white hot knives piercing his skin in addition to that his blood boiled burning him from the inside as well as the outside his mind played images of the ones he loved dead in bloody heaps harry felt as if he was going insane voldemort lifted the curse after what seemed to be ages and when harry lifted his head again he saw fuzzily draco malfoy urgently whispering to voldemort harry saw voldemort nod and smile and he knew something bad was about to happen he was right coming in the chamber was a tall stocky death eater clutching the limp body of hermione granger harry regained his wits when he saw hermione unmoving body tears welled up in his eyes but he blinked them away immediately pure unfiltered hatred ran through his blood stronger than ever before he stood even after thirty pain filled minutes of torture straight and proud facing the invincible dark lord who had caused him so much pain green eyes shone with hatred one day i vow that you ll pay for all this you filthy bastard you ll pay with that harry potter did the impossible he apparated to the limp form of a seventeen year old girl picked her up and disappeared from riddle mansion in the nick of time as twenty green jets of light left a smoldering hole in the wall where two teenagers had just been half a second ago at hogwarts school of wizardry a brilliant white light erupted flying through the halls filling everyone it hit with an indescribable feeling of loss and sadness all members of staff gather all the students into their common rooms it happened said a now sobbing minerva mcgonagall in the cold staff room twilight evabandmaber13 sorry it been a little while since i ve updated well here are the next few chapters chapter fourteen nightfall albus dumbledore had been in his office channeling his magic into young harry potter when he felt a strong surge of pain from the connection he had magically forged with the young wizard followed by an overwhelming sense of urgency dumbledore stood it was his time to go he faced his beloved pet phoenix goodbye old friend please give my final letters to them fawkes sung out a low note and tears started flowing out of the phoenix eyes albus took one last moment to say goodbye to his world a long life he had lived filled with bliss and sadness he had fought many evils and assisted many people of the light he had shared a love a long time ago a love with a fellow student that had once been at hogwarts with him it was now it was time he left this plane of existence and returned to her to begin the next great adventure albus had taught many students bonded with many people who grew to be great years of his long life had been well lived indeed he had been a bright child from birth with a large family brought up happily he had entered hogwarts at eleven and amazed the best of the best with his awesome skill in charms and transfiguration he had grown and graduated its halls becoming an alchemist working with a former professor nicolas flamel he had then gone on to study dragon blood and then became famous for discovering the twelve uses for it he had then studied as an auror researching and practicing spells then came the first dark age he had suffered along with everyone else but eventually he defeated grindelwald with the help of a newfound companion fawkes the phoenix peace had come and albus met his true love and begun to teach at hogwarts it seemed like happily ever after then until tom riddle a former student had become the second dark lord and brought about a new age of darkness upon the world then riddle had killed her his one true love albus swore that he d never love again he fought tirelessly against riddle thirsty for vengeance at riddle first downfall at the hands of young harry potter albus allowed himself a life of happiness once more reveling in the joys of watching young people grow learn and live he lost the blinding rage that had propelled him to fight in particular he watched harry potter and felt indebted to the wizard who had given him another chance for happiness he had done all he could to guide the growing wizard and experienced pride beyond pride as the young child took on burdens most alive today could boast about yet he had never lost his hold on humility years spent with his horrible relatives must ve done him some good after all albus was proud of harry and dreaded the day that he would have to part with this student when he had risen again two years ago albus was torn he literally fell apart although he never allowed this to be seen by anyone else he vowed that he d help young potter defeat him again he knew he himself would not be able to do it all himself he slowly bit by bit placed magical power gained from his long years of experience into the young wizard one day albus tried to quicken this process by adding large quantities of magical aura to harry and his friends he found that it crippled him enormously he couldntwalk around for four days even with the help of severus snape potions he could only barely manage to put in an appearance during breakfasts albus felt an even stronger sense of urgency from his connection with harry harry would need the extra strength now all the strength that albus could give him despite his weakened physical state he still had a lot of magic left in him albus picked up his wand and readied himself for the end now he would make the ultimate sacrifice to help harry in his moment of need to save the only hope of the wizarding world he raised his wand to his heart and prepared to say the last words of his life magicka sacrificum he whispered albus dumbledore collapsed as the entirety of his magic left his old body and found a home in harry potter as the magic that had lengthened his life left him in a bright white light albus dumbledore looked around his office one last time fell into his chair letting out a pained cry with the final breath of his long life that escaped his deflated lungs he was not regretful for his own demise after all death was but the next great adventure he was only remorseful for the fact that he wouldntfinish the adventure he had at hand oh god hermione dontbe dead harry hoped with all of his being that she was merely stunned ennervate hermione eyes slowly fluttered open at which harry yelled with laughter and hugged her tightly hermione oh thank the gods harry had tears of joy and relief welling up in his eyes what happened harry where are we where ron and ginny where malfoy where voldemort i ll tell you in a while we re in sirius cave at hogsmeade ron and ginny i have no idea i sure at least ginny got out i apparated us out of riddle mansion no idea how i did it but i did voldemort must ve forgotten to place an anti apparition charm or something but that impossible malfoy said malfoy he was guarding ron and ginny and he said something to goyle about telling voldemort to recast the charms unless he didntreach voldemort he reached him alright after the cruciatus i saw malfoy whisper something to voldemort and then they dragged you in i thought you were dead said harry messing up hermione hair as if it was her fault hmm no time to think we still need to find ron and ginny they re in hogwarts i think i can feel a weak link in the watches they were put under the full body bind when i found them harry stopped and thought about it for a second what happened to ginny watch why didntit deflect it i dontknow we ll ask her when we find them well we ll fly to hogwarts it the fastest way what you stand in voldemort mansion you get put under the most painful curse ever evented for thirty minutes you re outnumbered about a million to one and you somehow get out with your firebolt clutched in your hand and you somehow come and rescue me said hermione skeptically as if she expected harry to turn into voldemort at any second and yell april fools yeah i wish we didntlose the invisibility cloak though harry sobered the invisibility cloak was one of the few things his father had left behind for him a family heirloom we didntharry when never mind i ll tell you when we get to hogwarts c mon harry and hermione then got on the firebolt but instead of heading to hogwarts harry flew to hogsmeade we ll get you a broom it ll be faster that way no try using your portkey that dumbledore gave you for head boy duties oh yeah forgot all about that said harry grinning sheepishly activatio sure enough with a tug harry and hermione found themselves in hogwarts standing in dumbledore office harry turned around and before the grin had died he let out a horrible throaty gasp no no shit hermione get pomfrey or mcgonagall anyone go harry roared he himself bent down over dumbledore motionless body trying desperately to feel for a pulse fawkes swooped down and landed on harry shoulder he felt nothing ennervate no reaction from dumbledore cold lifeless body no ennervate revivito still no response harry began to pray out loud oh god hermione where are you dammit wake up ennervate harry let out a hopeless whisper no he cantbe yes he is potter and do you know why sneered snape from the door how snape managed to sneer in front of albus dumbledore cold dead body harry would never know why because of you you ve been sapping his power for nearly a year now severus shouted mcgonagall from the office door with hermione in tow minerva said snape in a sickly sweet voice potter leave at once tell me what happened i didnt sap his power something happened to him tell me what happened get out potter no fifty points from gryffindor for disobeying a direct order from a teacher leave now or it will be a hundred and detention for a month tell me what happened you harry said professor mcgonagall before snape could say anything else i believe you ought to sit down for this severus please prepare albus coffin he had it made for months now the two afternoons later harry walked in disbelief after hearing mcgonagall long tale about dumbledore sacrificing all his magic not to mention his life to get harry the necessary energy he needed to apparate out of riddle mansion how dumbledore had known all of this harry did not know although harry suspected that dumbledore was very close to omniscience amazingly mcgonagall had also said that dumbledore magic now resided within him but the fact remained albus dumbledore was gone harry was temporarily joyous at seeing ron and ginny safe and well but at the end of the night all he could think of was how albus dumbledore sacrificed his life for him not just for him he reminded himself but for the future of the world but just like that and another one of the few important people in harry life were taken away from him by the scum voldemort yesterday morning it was all over the papers the official cause of dumbledore death was of old age but many less reliable newspapers stated a conspiracy to murder albus dumbledore or that he had actually blown himself up by dropping a bottle of firewhiskey in the fireplace or things equally ridiculous however everyone mourned the death of the leader in the fight against the death eaters his scheduled memorial service although open only to the people who knew albus dumbledore well was to be held two days from now people would pay their respects to him during the time at work and cornelius fudge announced a holiday in remembrance of the great wizard in yesterday post but it wasntuntil this morning that the full consequence of dumbledore death was revealed at post in the eerily silent great hall the swooping sounds of owls heralded the arrival of the post in the front page was an article that shocked everyone in hogwarts everyone mass killings by he who must not be named it is with great difficulty that this reporter writes of the tragedy of the massive attacks led by you know who yesterday night an estimated number of muggles roughly five thousand were found dead in their homes with a lightning bolt cut across each one of their foreheads much like the scar that the boy who lived has it is obvious that with the renowned albus dumbledore having passed on you know who has set his eyes on the next target young harry potter who brought about his death the first time they met many small towns were pillaged and burnt but the final attack a massive rally of death eaters around big ben in london proved to be the worst three thousand muggles were killed in the area at the time and over a hundred wizards who had tried nobly to stop the invading force were also killed or tortured into insanity and are currently being treated in st mungo hospital the final attack of that night was on the big ben itself a monument for the muggle world and an important entry point into the ministry of magic for the wizarding world its fall proved to be devastating on both worlds on the remnants of the broken clock there was the word potter wrote in blood muggles are mystified and in terror and minister fudge plans on calling a state of emergency our readers hope that young harry potter aged 17 has a good plan to replace the late albus dumbledore in holding back the tide harry had stopped reading at that point he ran to the nearest bathroom and threw up his breakfast he walked out of the bathroom thinking he was all right but all of a sudden he felt dizzy and nearly collapsed on the floor until he was wrapped up by a pair of warm arms and drawn away from the toilet and when he next regained consciousness he found himself in a warm bed reaching for his glasses he instead felt an arm on where his bedside table should ve been he had then spent an hour pouring his soul out to ginny who listened and responded where appropriate but mainly they just held each other harry had been glad that ginny was there for the rest of the day would not be pleasant apart from another grueling potions lesson harry and hermione now had a blank void where dumbledore classes should ve filled the two sat silently in their shared common room harry mulling over the events caused by dumbledore death hermione silently reading rare magical plants for poisons and antidotes not looking at or talking to harry all of a sudden harry decided he had enough of just thinking he had to do something even if it was just to play exploding snap he couldntstand thinking about death any more not to mention that voldemort had killed five thousand people because he couldntreach harry where he was now accio firebolt hermione i going for a fly by the next week harry was thoroughly fed up his dreams were filled with images of people dying because of him and always ended with voldemort drawing a wand on ginny students up and down the halls avoided harry shot him scared glances and some even shrieked when he stepped into the great hall as if they expected death eaters to follow harry and start killing them at random the truth was harry couldntblame them he seemed to be a magnet for trouble and without dumbledore there security was extremely tight on hogwarts mcgonagall had stood in as headmistress although she walked around like a zombie clearly the wizard death had affected her deeply harry decided to cut himself away from the students at hogwarts his friends and teachers he was just about to fly away one night and buy a flat in diagon alley for himself to live and plan a counterattack against voldemort or so the plan was he couldntbring himself to separate himself from ginny without at least saying goodbye she had watched him carefully with her dark brown eyes for the last week and harry despite his state of shock felt it necessary to say goodbye to ginny he owed her at least an explanation when he had approached her though she had none of it she told him clearly it wasnther fault and if he left there would be nothing to stop voldemort from attacking hogwarts again he had only feared dumbledore before and he was growing scared of harry as his next strongest opponent harry felt it was a whole lot of rubbish and stated so clearly but when ginny lost her patience yelled at harry for his stupid sense of nobility said they were over until he could get his mind back to the way it should be and stalked out of the room he knew he couldntleave hogwarts whilst ginny was mad at him should he have died knowing ginny wasnthappy with him or anyone else he would ve regretted it more than ever he had spent a long night in the marauder room not returning to his own room until lunch the next day that night he had attended dumbledore memorial service at hogwarts and he saw why only friends were allowed at his funeral just friends alone there were thousands attending his funeral the hogwarts grounds had to be enlarged for the day to fit so many people it was the complete opposite of remus lupin funeral which had been nearly empty reporters stood outside the grounds waiting to interview the privileged few which were allowed to attend such a heart touching event mcgonagall had hexed several reporters until they would leave harry had many people walk up to him and wish him good luck telling him that dumbledore had had faith in him and they in turn had faith in him too harry was struck with guilt knowing that he was the reason why these people were miserable with their friend death right now harry walked along the corridors with hermione after an advanced charms class which was now taught by a professor orion an asian witch hired officially for transfiguration classes that were now abandoned by professor mcgonagall who had taken up the position of headmistress she was different from dumbledore instead of the kind blue eyes sparkling at them harry and hermione found a war hardened coal black gaze staring calmly back in professor mcgonagall old office this professor as ron would say was a slave driver the first charms lesson she had with harry and hermione she had hurled two stunning curses at them as they walked into the room which harry and hermione only avoided because of the net that had shot out of harry watch constant vigilance she had shouted with a knowing grin harry and hermione knew that these lessons would not be easy from sending bullet curses to mending bones harry and hermione had found themselves very busy indeed with charms and defence against the dark arts harry was thankful for these classes it kept his mind away from the constant attacks that were now reported daily in the daily prophet but the fact remained dumbledore was gone voldemort had no one to stop him everyone was either expecting him to conquer voldemort and all evil the next second or else they were expecting tornadoes fire and destruction to come wherever harry stepped and the only problem with these classes was that dumbledore wasntthe one to teach them it anymore this made all the difference to harry as he knew it was his fault hermione thankfully was oblivious to this as harry nor ginny had told her or ron about dumbledore channeling power into harry harry had received an envelope with a short letter of farewell from dumbledore and his wand enclosed he had smiled a bittersweet smile and looked to the heavens in thanks truthfully dumbledore wand had matched harry much better than he had thought it worked almost as if it was his own wand dumbledore said in his letter that he wished for harry to keep it as his own in remembrance harry spent all of his time now with hermione and ron completely avoiding ginny besides nods at mealtimes and brief goodnight at nighttime word spread through the school like wildfire and harry noticed much to his dislike that many of the boys who had wanted to ask ginny to the halloween ball practically leaped on her ron had stood by harry in this ordeal he had gave withering stares at any male who dared go within five meters of ginny he talked to ginny for harry sake although without much success and he had eventually gone to the extent of ignoring ginny whenever she was with another boy other than harry or himself hermione had of course maintained her usual righteous pose supporting both harry and ginny and acting as a liaison between them right now harry saw ginny laughing and batting at a short sandy haired sixth year who was grinning back at her stupidly harry stopped in his tracks leaving hermione who was still talking about self polishing wands at the top of her voice walking alone along the corridor unaware that her friend had frozen in place the sandy haired boy slung his arm around ginny shoulders and harry snapped with jealousy he was about to whip out his wand and hex the ignorant prat that dared touch his girl but he found that fortuna his mysticat had done a job for him fortuna jumped out of his bag ran to the boy and scratched him twice and bit him once leaving bloody gashes across the boy cheeks and a rather nasty bite on the nose harry heard ginny grab fortuna around the middle and admonish fortuna harry couldnthelp but smile he picked up fortuna who was squirming away from ginny arms nodded a rather cold nod to ginny shot the bleeding boy a withering glare and ran to catch up with hermione fortuna on his shoulder he didnteven give ginny or the boy a chance to moan about his cat it was funny that fortuna didntscratch ginny harry supposed that fortuna loved ginny like he did despite his anger that my mysticat fortuna harry smiled at his beautiful kitten stroking him gently fortuna purred with happiness oh harry what did he do scratched little mouse boy back there in the face for me what ginny friend harry nodded slowly clever little cat must know which people are pure scum now harry i dontthink that fair i think you should go apologize for fortuna behavior what me apologize to the little creep who slinking his arm over my girl you must be out of your mind harry muttered what whacking your bludgers now harry said ron who had just come out of his charms class and caught up to harry and hermione who were walking down to care of magical creatures to meet hagrid to discuss their pets ron and hermione eggs had just hatched three days ago and just yesterday respectively ron was a curious hamster like creature that crookshanks delighted in chasing about ron had grown rather uneasy at the point when crookshanks leaped at his newly hatched creature and swatted crookshanks in the face leaving the cat spitting furiously at him and hermione slapping him hermione egg had hatched into a rather ugly little leathery creature with large blue eyes and scaly skin harry had tried speaking parseltongue to the creature with no success hermione had spent hours in the library looking for an answer also with no success ron had just laughed at it and got a bitten arm in return it appeared that ron had gotten the most information they now knew that it had poisonous fangs hermione had no sympathy for ron and they got into another row whilst harry had to drag ron to get the bite checked on it had swelled purple already at that point it turned out it was a rather funny poison giving the victim a squeaky voice for a day after the bite and more importantly there wasnta cure until it healed naturally ron suffered embarrassment as he made a long speech at the prefects meeting in a squeaky house elf voice harry himself was curious to find out what this critter was as they knocked at hagrid door hang on a sec n hollered hagrid from the door they heard fang familiar bark and hagrid opened the door oh its you three though you mighta forgot all bout me you haven been to see me for a month hi hagrid ron hermione and harry said and smiled fondly at their half giant friend c mon in c mon in tea some rock cakes waved hagrid at shapeless lumps placed on the table fang jumped at ron and slobbered all over his face thank you hagrid said hermione i was wondering could you tell me what this creature is it hatched just yesterday and i cantfind any reference in the books oh righ ermione that there is a crownfish mainly water creatures i surprised its managed to stay alive for a day without any water you should toss it into the sink or somefin babies usually only stay alive for a day out of water o course adults can last roundabout a week er so hermione let out a shriek and ran to the sink bathing her crownfish in the sink full of water letting out a sigh of relief she said thanks hagrid hagrid had laughed at ron whispered comment to him what did you say ron asked hermione curiously oh nothing hagrid what did ron say oh nuthin important said hagrid with a smile harry dontask me i just went temporarily deaf back then harry smiled at that he remembered how dumbledore had once done the same in his fourth year oh you three are hopeless i going to put little queenie in a fishtank or something queenie roared ron in laughter hermione let out a loud hmph and walked out of hagrid hut you know she didnteven hermione stomped back in grabbed the fish from the sink and with a simple goodbye to hagrid she walked away the three men laughed their hearts out when ron and harry were leaving hagrid pulled harry back it okay ron go first i ll catch up with you you all righ there harry i ve heard bout you n little ginny weasley a mask of indifference flew up to harry face oh yeah bin watchin her sometimes late at night sneaks up to the quidditch pitch and dives round kinda like you i thought well wha i wanna say is whatever it is that gone on with you n her fix it n fix it quick she a pretty one no doubt about it and i could see that you do love her something like your mother and father if i may say so meself wonderful little girl you have in ginny weasley charming and nice perfect for you but what exactly has happened between you two why have you broken up it not my fault this time you see harry launched into a heartfelt explanation about his problems with ginny and how he had managed to make her mad and in turn how mad he was at seeing idiot sixth years flirting with her all day alrigh harry the question is do you still want her in your life of course i do she ginny there no one else better than her but i not apologizing or anything its not my fault i meant every word i said you may say that now but a time may come when its too late to swallow yer words you may regret it one day arry if you get the chance to make things up with little ginny weasley you better well take it dontlet pride get in yer way if the chance comes you better well take it or you may just end up regretting it for the rest of your life harry saw a strange pained look in hagrid eyes as if he was advising harry on his own bad experiences if the chance comes you better well take it twilight evabandmamber13 chapter fifteen in the serpent mind tom marvolo riddle stood in his cold empty house alone his followers out striking the eiffel tower in paris he had just a couple of house elves and wormtail in his house to serve on him he was exhilarated two weeks ago little half blood potter had cast the killing curse on him he smashed against the wall writhing in agony but in five tortured seconds it was over and he was alive he had done the impossible he reached immortality and a day after potter and his mudblood brat escaped from his clutches angry as he was he couldnthide his glee at finally achieving his dream he was immortal he was as powerful as god and probably even stronger than him what sweetened the day even more was the death of albus dumbledore despite what he may act like in front of everyone else albus dumbledore truly was a wizard that he had once feared he had seen through him at school and had been the greatest opposing force in his first reign in power he had almost defeated him once near the start of his reign stripping him of almost all of his powers it took long years to rebuild and add to his powers and when he resurfaced all that was left of tom riddle were the memories he had celebrated the day by announcing his next target in the plainest way possible gathering all of his forces he terrorized england since then things had gone all uphill for lord voldemort he had recovered the veil of death from the ministry of magic he had captured minister fudge and placed a loyal death eater in his position using polyjuice potion he had viktor krum in his prisons torturing him for information on the headquarters of the order of the phoenix the last competent force that stood in his way no his death eaters way he himself had no opposition he was immortal but most significantly he had just captured a weasley from what draco malfoy had informed him of this family was the closest thing potter had to a family he would be sure to keep this weasley as blackmail material in the future he waited alone in his throne room looking upon the dishes of the finest french food and wine the house elves could make he drank his wine and decided it was time to prepare a massive attack one that would make grindelwald jealous he decided with dumbledore out of the way he d strike at hogwarts after all potter couldntstop him he was still a boy better to press the advantage now before he truly reached manhood but what was he thinking about no one could stop him now he was immortal his life goal had been achieved now what he needed to do was proceed to his second goal in life the noble work that was needed to rid the world of impurities and re establish the meaning of pureblood in the world after all muggles were scum all of them just like his father they deserved it he thought they were just unthankful little beasts parasites scavengers why they existed in the first place multiplying like rats he would never know what he did know was he would be the one to purge the world of these muggles it was his vision a society of purebloods some mudbloods kept as slaves and he would be the master of this society he was born to rule born to be great he was their sole heir of salazar slytherin when the filthy muggle blood that had left his veins so did the ability to sympathize emotion was a weakness and lord voldemort would allow himself no weakness unlike those disgusting little good wizards who prided themselves for taking a stand against evil there was no such thing as good or evil just power and those who were too weak to seek it as he had told young harry potter before he had become irrevocably stuck on to the good side how dare he refuse the heir of slytherin the little half blood had also escaped from him many times by now luck had always seemed to side with the brat he would not escape the next time they met the fool had even dared to challenge him in front of his own death eaters amazing guts the boy did have but had very little if any brains in his skull rage took lord voldemort and he decided that he would take it out on the disgusting muggle loving albus dumbledore fort poring over his plans tom riddle let out a savage smile careful potter i coming to get you he summoned wormtail with a wave of his wand wormtail appeared by his side slightly wincing with pain voldemort knew better than anyone else that the summoning of his servants caused them much pain they deserved it he thought pain made one strong it killed off the emotion of love a useless feeling that cut off a man better sense tom riddle had ceased to love from the moment he was born he had seen true love in his lifetime but he could never understand it perfectly powerful wizards throwing their lives out for the sake of mudblood witches it was unthinkable wormtail come here the short little man stumbled over in his anxiousness to serve his master voldemort pulled up wormtail sleeve and stroked the dark mark on his arm wormtail bit his lip hiding his pain but lord voldemort knew everything going on in the minds of his followers wormtail was unhappy scared he knew that wormtail loyalty was already fading and was now only staying with him because he was the strong one in the war he had no choice this instead of bothering him made him smile in delight lord voldemort loved the thought of hierarchy the strongest rule the weakest serve because everyone knew he was indeed the strongest it was his responsibility to try and help his loyal followers attain a level of strength too torture and fear was needed to be strong his own childhood was a difficult one living life knowing that disgusting muggle filth had plagued his very own blood it was not until he had grown older did he find a way to filter and destroy the muggle blood within him and only then did he truly become lord voldemort yes fear and suffering was important indeed it was the training that everyone needed to become strong death eaters began apparating to his side and kneeling down before him he knew that most of the death eaters were either in awe of him and were afraid or they were just thirsty for a bit of power only a few were truly loyal to him when they had all arrived lord voldemort stood i believe my dear death eaters after a series of minor attacks including your attack on the eiffel tower which i sure has succeeded it is time for a full scale attack no death eater spoke up none of them were stupid enough to interrupt their lord in a speech as important as this one what say you all to destroying the safe haven of my first reign how about we destroy dumbledore safehouse and rip apart his corpse how about we show the world that harry potter isntthe all powerful hero how about we set about our greatest goal to rid the world of mudbloods and muggles he shouted death eaters cheered clapped and stomped their feet then it is settled my loyal servants we strike in thirteen days it was a curious thing the veil of death lord voldemort heard more than anyone else what was behind it or rather what was in it there were voices of people people banging on steel walls with bare fists to get out they were struggling people both good and bad it was a phenomenon for these people were not yet dead but trapped in another dimension how this veil managed to do so was amazing he could invent a spell that would do the same it would be a better punishment than death a meaningless existence trapped on another plane of existence forsaken by your very friends to be dead yes that would be torture worse than any pain for a wizard of the light to see what no one can see but also to find no purpose in living no joys no happiness lord voldemort smiled a sneer like smile of delight imagining the good wizards that had fallen into the veil it was settled he d work to develop a spell to mirror the veil effects it would be the fate for young potter but first he would have to study this magical veil and see just how it worked and how to reverse the effects if possible at all he would need some experiments and some guinea pigs to work with wormtail fetch me viktor krum you krum have the honor of assisting me in my experiments since you so unwittingly defied me in giving me information viktor krum his face gaunt his eyes sunken slumping over pathetically spat at voldemort feet crucio as krum twitched on the floor biting his lip to not allow a scream to escape voldemort said now let try that again now why dontwe imperio stand up filthy bulgarian krum stood put your hand into the veil krum moved slowly his face muscle twitching violently for just a second he walked slowly up to the veil voldemort felt the internal battle going on in krum mind he stuck his hand into the gently swaying veil silently take your hand out as krum took his right hand out from the veil he let out a savage shriek the hand was gone and all that was left was a stump voldemort looked upon this with a smile now put half of your head in and observe what you see krum now visibly shook on the outside voldemort sensed the imperius curse weakening do it now krum did as he was told now take your head out he was monsterous disgusting unreal it was impossible to live the way viktor krum was standing half his brain amputated what did you see krum dying word was black he fell to the floor dead without any blood lord voldemort found himself staring at half a human head and the rest of the body with a right hand missing mobilicorpus krum body was floating in the air lightly voldemort directed it into the veil slowly watching how the veil liquefied and absorbed the body indeed it looked painful the experiment was pretty much successful lord voldemort knew what he really needed to know but what did krum mean by black surely the next dimension wouldntbe as dull as a blank black world would it however there was no time to ponder on this work needed to be done voldemort summoned a rarely used dark arts book dusted it off and began his research to create the spell to banish people into the separate plane report malfoy on your father condition yes my lord my father is currently recovering rapidly he is quickly learning to use a wand now however all the spells he once knew he forgot but if mother teaches him a spell it comes naturally to him it must be in his blood does he remember anything of the world no my lord when will he be ready to resume service i not sure master he may be developing rapidly but he is still just a baby in mind i d say a couple of years at the earliest until he is able to serve again we have no use for him then withdraw your mother from this tiresome task i need all the death eaters i can get on board for the attack on hogwarts even with dumbledore out of the way hogwarts is still very safe for them but master what of my father see if he regains any memory if we leave him alone to die but crucio how dare you question me draco malfoy writhed on the floor yelling out in agony the shrieks of pain were like music to voldemort ears well any objections sneered voldemort no master stuttered draco malfoy and ran as fast as his pained legs could carry him out of the room voldemort smiled drinking another glass of the finest red wine in france to a victory at hogwarts little malfoy was lucky that he felt very forgiving right now wormtail he bellowed yes yes yes master call all our overseas followers this will be a full scale attack this time hogwarts will bow to our power voldemort had gathered all of the petty underground criminal organizations he could find also quantity in this battle would most surely be more important than quality he lord voldemort would wipe out the safe haven for mudbloods that the old fool had protected for so long thirst for vengeance was built up in lord voldemort all those pathetic students whose blood was tainted with the muggle filth like that pathetic excuse for a human his father was would be killed captured tortured and killed he let out a long evil laugh it was seven days until the scheduled day of the attack now avery and dolohov i have a task for you two under the polyjuice potions i trust you are ready yes master good dolohov as fudge i want you to call an emergency auror attack on hogwarts minerva mcgonagall is a traitor to them she has been passing me information that is your excuse if you really need one hopefully your emergency powers as the minister should allow you to call this attack without specifying a reason yes my lord i believe the minister word is sufficient enough to call a strike force into action said dolohov rather sarcastically for lord voldemort liking that will be our first wave of attackers no doubt hogwarts defences will not fall to them but it cuts off their extra support use the aurors to set up anti apparition and portkey spells and to blast open the main door and then send them into the forest where our troops will be waiting we kill them then and there to cripple the ministry and to destroy hogwarts in one day think of it as two birds with one stone avery as viktor krum i want you to infiltrate hogwarts sources state that he is a member of dumbledore order an overseas spy they will trust him take your position within hogwarts when i give the signal an explosion of the gamekeeper hut i want you to draw your wand and eliminate severus snape he is one of the few competent teachers left in the school that could really cause us some problems if possible i want you to find and kill the headmistress mcgonagall and the auror mad eye moody also i hear of a new teacher employed by mcgonagall should she look dangerous and should your cover still be intact end her life as well yes master when the battle starts if your cover is not yet blown i want you to discreetly attack whatever defences hogwarts has left from within their own ranks understood yes master oh and leave potter to me yes everything was going well he could almost feel his fingers crushing potter skull and the shrieks of his friends and worshipers watching their last hope being crushed like a bug all was blissful for lord voldemort he had now finished the spell to banish potter soul into the separate plane of existence but he wouldntuse it until he had broken potter body mind and soul vengeance would be ever so sweet it was a day before the attack he shuddered in anticipation everything was perfect his forces were thousands strong he had dolohov and avery positioned already he had finished the banishing spell to send potter into the seventh dimension morale was high indeed tonight hogwarts would meet its end and the hero of the wizarding world would fall with it he trembled with delight master we re ready reported draco malfoy voldemort took a while to survey his forces assembled inside the magically enlarged riddle mansion five hundred strong attack trolls his fifty loyal death eaters eight thousand dark wizards about four thousand criminals he had amassed and all that was left of the dementors in the whole of britain and europe excellent on my order we move out hogwarts shall fall trolls stomped humans stomped and clapped criminals hooted and bellowed and dementors let out rattle like hisses onwards we go loyal forces wizards that could apparate did so trolls and dementors were sent by custom made portkeys other wizards that couldntapparate flooed or portkeyed he himself apparated right in the middle of a pub in hogsmeade he remembered this particular pub as one he visited often during his time at hogwarts all memories it was a sign of weakness weakness was not for lord voldemort maximus reducto he bellowed blowing the pub into pieces lord voldemort has arrived for any onlooker it would ve been a terrible scene wizards could be seen all around sent spells flying about hogsmeade ripping apart the beautiful little village trolls blundered about smashing cottages into sawdust dementors glided everywhere performing the kiss on anyone who was foolish enough to still be in the area but most horrible of all was the pale white face and the glowing red eyes of lord voldemort who very presence struck fear into the very soul of everything in a mile radius from him every last wizard witch and child who saw this massive army knew exactly what or rather who it was looking for the boy who lived every single one of them prayed for his soul and theirs darkness had already began to fall twilight evabandmamber13 i love this chapter chapter sixteen fortress crushed harry wasnthaving a good day at all after a double session with orion he and hermione were utterly exhausted the fact that ginny was giving him the cold shoulder made days worse and worse until he really considered hagrid advice when he saw ron and ginny joking around on the way down to the hall behind them he stood there and waited you go on ahead hermione ron will be there with you in a sec i need a word with ginny hermione nodded with understanding in her gaze and left him and believe it or not the prat actually asked me out on a date ron and ginny held on to each other in their laughter until they saw the dark haired harry potter standing in their path ginny beautiful smile on her face was immediately snapped into an uncaring expressionless look as she nodded at harry and made to move past him ginny i need a word please i not sure i want to hear a word from you inwardly he thought to himself since when did little ginny weasley who used to have a crush on me turn into a stone cold beautiful girl that could make me do anything for her outwardly he said please gin the miserable tone in his voice had made ginny drop her ice queen act ron do you mind she said ron nodded curtly and walked to the great hall alone look ginny i sorry i made you angry after you told me not to do the whole it my fault thing it was just the situation it ate me up with guilt and when you started to i just oh harry you know i never meant to hurt you i just couldntstand you hurting yourself it really isntyour fault it voldemort he an evil bastard none of it your fault but you know i just cantstand watching my boyfriend blame himself for something he fought so hard against i think that what ginny thought harry never found out for a massive boom was heard throughout hogwarts moody voice was heard magically ringing through the halls students return to dorms immediately school is under attack everyone in the halls started shrieking and flapping their arms around stupidly running without orientation like a bunch of headless chickens harry was sure he heard a person actually squawk i going out no harry its obvious he out after me so i ll go and save everyone from getting hurt or worse it your responsibility as head boy to help gryffindors back into the tower now c mon it was utter chaos as prefects herded their students away to their common rooms everyone screaming madly some of the students quite stupidly ran out of the front doors and straight into voldemort army harry watched as professors mcgonagall orion snape moody sprout and flitwick flew out of the doors sending curses as they went but was alarmed at the sight of quidditch star viktor krum tailing them wait something isntright said ginny at his shoulder viktor was captured by voldemort he canthave escaped its nearly impossible harry snapped around immediately remembering how voldemort had sneaked a death eater into hogwarts once before under polyjuice potion he might ve just done it again what happened next was in slow motion krum who had drawn his wand but pointed it at snape started yelling something to harry horror no expelliarmus he cried it was the first dueling spell he had ever learnt it was his first instinct to go with it the jet of red light flew remarkably fast towards krum smacking into him before he had even finished the incantation but his wand glowed an eerie green as it flew to harry he didntcatch it krum had snapped around and stared harry straight in the eye harry stared straight back and felt something the man was hiding something death eater what are you talking about i viktor krum dontyou remember stupefy shouted harry krum fell into a heap ritorno harry shouted what on earth do you think you re doing potter shouted mcgonagall who had turned to see harry sending a spell towards krum which hit him flat death eater polyjuice trust me sure enough krum had fallen backwards and turned into a sneering death eater still stunned get back to your dormitory but i can help now harry grabbed ginny and fled had he been alone he certainly would ve joined the fray but there was no way on earth he would let ginny be hurt now that he had just fixed things up with her they had just reached the portrait hole when sounds of metal being dropped against the ground were heard beauty rest yes indeed mr potter said the portrait and opened c mon get in ginny she jumped nimbly into the room and he followed after her and closed the portrait in after him what on earth are we going to do just sit here harry cried as soon as he entered what else can we do we re members of the order we should be out there fighting speaking of fighting why is it only a few teachers fighting god knows how many wizards voldemort has it not mr potter said mcgonagall stern voice we ve prepared hogwarts for a time like this hogwarts is on lockdown the old witch climbed in through the portrait hole and took a seat on the empty sofa letting out a sigh what lockdown we re a fortress now there is no safer place on earth but what about voldemort come and see mcgonagall rose apparently she did think hogwarts was safe now or else she would never lead students out harry and ginny followed mcgonagall to the great hall where harry found all the windows closed and blocked with a layer of steel but that just metal voldemort can break through it not just any metal these are magically enhanced defences built in godric gryffindor day nothing will penetrate it nothing can get in or out but what about the people outside questioned harry they sighed mcgonagall no you didn t exclaimed ginny hagrid no i going out it too late harry i saw them take him him and all of the second year gryffindors and slytherins and you locked them out are you mad harry you must understand there was nothing we could do to it was for the greater good should one sacrifice everyone or a few by now harry had already walked out come back here mr potter or what you ll take points from me give me a detention ban me from playing quidditch revoke my head boy status confiscate my broom screw that i finding hagrid i coming with you said ginny leaping up after him no ginny you re too young no i not i just a few months younger than you i dontcare what the world thinks of you boy who lived or not you re my boyfriend you re my friend but you re not my boss i coming with you mcgonagall sighed stupefy harry and ginny awoke on the couch of the head boy and girl common room my sister was snuggling with my best friend eww said ron in a childish voice harry let out a laugh despite himself hermione smacked ron a smile curling up on her face ginny smiled and cuddled up closer to harry still with her eyes closed wait we were going to rescue hagrid why are we started ginny who had all of a sudden snapped out of her daze bringing harry violently back to reality also damn mcgonagall i going you three stay here without waiting for a response harry ran towards the portrait hole tried to budge it open but it stuck firmly on dammit she even locked us in what are we animals ron mumbled something under his breath and hermione and ginny giggled how can you three be doing this when hagrid is probably being tortured by voldemort the laughter died from ron hermione and ginny faces leaving harry feeling very guilty indeed sorry i know there nothing you three can do oh yeah and there something you can challenged ron and ginny at the same time yeah voldemort wants me not any of you he started harry we just had a conversation about this cried ginny yeah you re right you re right we re no good to no one just sitting here are we correct miss granger how observant of you sneered ron how do we unlock the portrait hole we don t are you seriously suggesting we just sit here no of course not i suggesting we make a portkey its what i ve been reading about for the past hour you and ginny were snuggling about on the couch harry shot hermione a mean look then said well what are you waiting for make one to hagrid hut all right all right hermione stood and grabbed a quill from her desk portus she cried with a look of supreme concentration on her face the quill glowed a greenish color and trembled for a moment then dropped to the floor well i think it worked let go then harry grabbed the portkey with ginny hand beside his ron and hermione barely fitting a finger on the small quill nothing happened urgh hermione you did it wrong that impossible i followed every step give it to me and tell me what to do honestly fine think of your destination very clearly and say clearly the incantation portus mmm okay portus this time the quill glowed blue and quivered violently before settling on the floor again accio quill harry grabbed the quill and flashed his friends a cheeky smile as he expected to be pulled away to hagrid hut nothing came damn harry turned red you tried to pull a fast one on us potter growled ron pushing harry in the chest causing him to flip over the sofa and land painfully on his shoulder his glasses flying off ron beseeched hermione harry she added as an afterthought ginny however pulled harry up and grabbed him by his arms donttry anything like that again if you had actually got a portkey working i would ve killed you for leaving us i sure it worked when dumbledore did them they looked exactly the same anti portkey charms cried hermione stupid stupid harry grabbed a handful of floo powder ginny still pulling on his arms minerva mcgonagall he hollered into the flames mcgonagall strict face appeared in the fire smiling at them why did you lock us up yelled harry before ron hermione or ginny could stop him why because you d run out of the school and break down our fortress defences of course if a student left than the defences would be taken down for ten minutes voldemort could infiltrate the are you honestly telling me that you re leaving hagrid and twenty students out there to die they re they re already harry slumped down covering his face dead he let out a strangled gasp i afraid so no in one swift motion harry grabbed another handful of floo powder threw it in the spot mcgonagall head had been and stepped straight into the fire hagrid hut a twirling sensation started but harry found himself forced out of the same fireplace that he had come in from why he cried harry collapsed it could not be hagrid the last adult in his life dead it was impossible preposterous mcgonagall must be lying hagrid was the first wizard he had ever met hagrid had taken him away from the dursleys hagrid had shown him the wonderful diagon alley hagrid had given him his first pet his first true companion hagrid had always been there for him in his little hut with rock hard rock cakes and tea he was jerked out of his thoughts abruptly by a loud explosion they re breaking the wards hermione whispered her voice sounding frightened more explosions could be heard the wards still held hogwarts in all of its glory was now surviving only on thousand year old charms from foes recklessly hammering against its walls in the last two days students had stayed cooped up in their common rooms being served on by house elves harry sat brooding all day not talking to hermione ron or ginny giving up on engaging harry in conversation the three had taken to playing games and trying to joke light heartedly to no avail the atmosphere was tense with explosions being heard every few minutes on the third afternoon after voldemort first strike things started to fall apart students of hogwarts came mcgonagall voice magically magnified prepare to evacuate take only what you need those three words caused a very nasty feeling in harry body how on earth the teachers were going to evacuate hundreds of students harry mind didnthave an answer why did mcgonagall trust so much in hogwarts defences she should ve evacuated students far earlier explosions were now more frequent and louder hogwarts defences were failing time was running short the four friends grabbed their essentials and valuables and prepared to run down to the great hall students gather around gather around first years go with professor morton you will be using floo powder to evacuate second third fourth and fifth years you will go with professor jenkins you will be using portkeys to evacuate sixth and seventh years you may stay and fight if you wish or you may either fly by broomstick take a portkey or use secret passages guided by mr filch across the school to get to hogsmeade where professor sprout is waiting for you with the knight bus on my call a tremendous explosion was heard students heard with the impending feeling of doom the cracking of wood voldemort dark forces had broken in go now harry ran to hold off voldemort forces he was the first one there fortuna on his shoulder unfortunately before he fired a curse off he saw that voldemort and his supporters had their wands pressed to the heads of the second years and hagrid they were alive one more move potter and all of them die ginny hermione ron luna neville justin ernie terry and blaise zabini gathered behind him and around his sides about ten other sixth years that harry did not know were mingled amongst the crowd professors snape orion mcgonagall vector trelawney much to harry numb surprise flitwick and moody flanked the sides of the students foolish potter foolish indeed see you not the thousands of forces i have at my disposal you wontwin spat harry his brave sounding words reflected nothing of his inner thoughts and every last person standing with him knew it he knew that they stood absolutely no chance against this massive force and they were only biding their time hoping that the other students would get away in time drop your wand potter or i ll kill them off one by one he bent slowly down and placed his wand down rest of you follow the boy everyone else dropped his or her wands hesitatingly kill them all sneered voldemort once the wands had been dropped no cried someone behind harry avada kedavra the room was filled with green light portus harry had whipped out dumbledore wand and aimed at where hagrid had stood to turn something he was wearing into a portkey when the green light cleared harry noticed that hagrid was no longer there he hoped that hagrid had gotten away by his portkey and not have been disintegrated or anything he assumed that he must ve succeeded in getting hagrid out as no death eater used any spell different from the killing curse the other students were not as lucky twenty dead twelve year olds lay at the death eater feet kill their petty little defence force leave potter to me get behind me now cried harry the students jumped behind him as he grasped dumbledore wand tightly trixtonia he yelled an enormous shockwave erupted from harry wand reflecting the many beams of red light sent at him and knocking ten death eaters sprawling although this spell was basically like swatting at a giant with a blade of grass it provided the slight distraction needed for everyone to regroup and grab their wands hogwarts few defenders turned rolled picked up their wands those who also had spare wands held one wand in each hand and shot multiple rallies of spells towards voldemort forces but it was no good most the spells found their targets but the thousands of forces attacking were far too powerful for a handful of wizards to repel let alone win against crucio yelled a voice harry noticed that the beam of red light was flying towards him he didnthave enough time to move harry tensed his muscles preparing for the overwhelming sense of pain to take him it didntcome harry took a second to observe his watch nothing then he saw fortuna who eyes were now glowing with an eerie green light he remembered dumbledore words from what seemed a lifetime ago wonderfully loyal creatures they are once they bond with a wizard they stay with them until they die they gain very unique magical powers as they grow with the wizard dumbledore had said it appeared that fortuna was now gaining some powers however within a few minutes professors trelawney and vector terry ernie and justin had fallen down dead or stunned harry couldnttell ginny stood with hermione and ron behind her her watch deflecting almost all the spells cast at her the unforgivable curses were merely dodged by the three of them all temporary joy that his mysticat was growing up left him things were looking bleak professors moody snape mcgonagall and orion were actively casting killing curses in quick succession harry himself was sending storms of acid to rain down on voldemort troops ginny ron and hermione were sending parasite curses around and once hitting a target hurling the massive shockwave spell harry had started the battle off with it was a good combination however the professors and students were being pushed further and further back until directly behind them were the great hall doors dementors had a horrible effect on many of the students causing them to collapse on to the floor shaking trolls had started bashing things about mainly causing a mess voldemort forces were now making a perimeter around what was left of the students and professors in just a few more minutes they would be surrounded terremotio yelled a voice from voldemort side suddenly the earth instantly began shaking furiously sending voldemort forces into disarray run yelled snape the students and professors sprinted around hogwarts in different directions pushing over death eaters in the process confusing trolls and bowling into dementors traitor roared voldemort harry stopped a second and looked at who had betrayed voldemort not to mention saving them he would try to help them until he saw levitated high in the air peter pettigrew he spat harry potter we re even i owe you nothing our debt is settled harry thought he had gone a bit mad as pettigrew laughed maniacally whilst being twirled around in the air eventually throwing up all over a dementor until he remembered what had happened at the end of his third year when he had let pettigrew go free back to his master that was what had started the second reign of terror it was all his fault he thought that pettigrew would never repay the wizards debt evidentially the debt had been torturing pettigrew to such an extent that he now was prepared to sacrifice his worthless life to cleanse himself of his treasons by saving harry potter one last time pettigrew eyes were unfocused and yet opened up wide as he spun around in the air being hit by cruciatus curses from death eaters around him harry just realized that he had done the stupidest thing ever by staying behind and waiting to see who had saved them the next second passed in slow motion thousands of jets of light flew at harry who was standing immobile he thought miserably anywhere but here and with a loud crack he somehow found himself the next second standing outside the marauder room find him and bring him to me he heard voldemort voice yell below how on earth did he teleport in hogwarts it was impossible however now wasntthe time to ponder the laws of magic harry immediately stuck his wand into the hole that opened the marauder room and whispered i solemnly swear that i am up to no good he heard footsteps coming up the hole was just big enough for him to dive through he just did it in time to avoid being seen prongs harry whispered with relief he saw that the hole had shrunk to just big enough to fit a wand in again he turned to see ginny hermione and ron holding their wands to his head what are you doing it me dontlisten it might be a trick muttered ron hermione and ginny nodded fervently could anyone else do this harry swept out his spare wand in one fluid motion and stuck his holly wand right in front of hermione nose dumbledore wand at ginny heart he left ron alone donttry it cried ron sparks flew out of the three of their wands ow dontbe stupid ron its me harry harry dropped his wands to show that he wasntsome death eater in disguise they still werentconvinced harry couldntsee why as no one else knew how to get into the marauder room apparently ginny was thinking along the same lines no one but harry knows how to get into this room why where are we anyway the marauder room answered harry simply harry heard hermione muttering silencing charms and shield charms at the hole to distract himself he looked to the marauder shield hanging on the wall a stag a wolf and a dog lay faded and blackened on the shield the rat glowed bright white for a second and then dwindled away to a miserable black joining its fellows in darkness peter pettigrew the last of the marauders was gone he died redeemed and that in itself was enough to be thankful for the shield glowed with a cold blue glow and a second later the four places where moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had been engraved were blank harry unconsciously walked up the shield and placed his wand where the stag had been as if it could bring his father back he didntexpect a green light to blind him temporarily as a lion found itself on the marauder shield what but why he stuttered i think i know this wasntmade for the marauders whispered hermione no but why is there a lion on the shield now it cantbe its impossible would you mind sharing with the rest of us hermione or do you want us to stand here waiting for an explanation from someone else who just happens to come along and know exactly what you re thinking an empathy maybe hermione rolled her eyes and said harry take the shield off the wall and see if there any writing on the back harry feeling a bit stupid took the shield off the wall and flipped it over indeed there was writing although it looked ancient and in spidery messy engraving together be bound in friendship and in love swear you solemn oaths of faith forever seal your fates in one he read it aloud to hermione ron and ginny hermione gasped i dont believe it ron and ginny looked at her as if she was slightly insane harry you re holding the shield of the founders twilight evabanmamber13 this 1 was fun to write from what i remember chapter seventeen saving the students what the shield of the founders questioned ron harry and ginny at the same time it a mystical shield which was said to be a myth found by the founders of hogwarts in a stash of merlin things it is said to be a bonding talisman which is honestly ron dontyou ever pay attention in class no hermione rolled her eyes before continuing a bonding talisman forms a strong connection between a certain number of wizards which magnifies their abilities as long as the four are in a reasonably close proximity to each other but it only opens up to selected few the bonds can only be broken by a betrayal within the group if everyone dies or if the shield is broken itself although no one but the people that are actually bonded can do so the betrayal will not erase the marks on the shield only death can do that it was said that if a person redeemed himself after breaking the bonds of loyalty the bonds would also reconnect i sure that what might ve happened with the marauders it also quite dangerous should one of the people be secretly hiding bitterness towards another member of the group then the bonding talisman can go seriously wrong but no one seen a bonding talisman since the founders themselves or at least no one recognized it eat the textbook shut up ron oh and no offence to your dad harry but they obviously didntknow what it was for they must ve thought it was just a pretty shield which they made their own and played music added ginny so what do we do about it well you already have your symbol on it who are the three people you trust most stupid question really you three of course ginny hermione and ron beamed at him then we should add our vows into the shield and complete the bonding talisman magic hermione smiled as if she had just answered a question right in charms but isntit dangerous only if one of us has bitterness directed at each other that doesntapply to any of you does it ginny peered around at the three of them no not at all but now isntthe time to do this there are death eaters out in the halls looking for us which is exactly why we have to do this as the bond is first created it should be at its optimum strength if the four of us concentrate hard enough we might be able to break the security charms voldemort might ve cast over hogwarts brilliant cried harry and ron ginny however looked a bit unsettled hermione i dontthink this is safe look back on the history of the shield of the two groups we know have bonded one of them have gone bad about as bad as they could go but it them not us ginny none of us would betray each other would we harry said no way not a chance neither would pettigrew or slytherin have that sent the group into silence we know that pettigrew and slytherin were once bonded very happily with their friends and that they carried no intent on harming one of their friends at all but something must ve happened for all we know it could be this shield but ginny we might need the powers now we have to save what left of the people in hogwarts ginny looked as if she might object but silently nodded ron walked to the shield okay so what do i do tap the shield once and concentrate on harry ron tapped the shield with his wand and screwed up his face in concentration the atmosphere went extremely cold they felt as if they were at risk a jet of pale blue light flew from ron wand into the shield a grizzly bear appeared where a dog had once been cool ron exclaimed hermione stepped up and tapped her wand where the wolf had once been a yellow light came from hermione wand and a fox appeared on the shield harry smirked at hermione so far her inner animal was the most boring one yet ginny stepped forwards and waved her wand over the part where the rat had been harry felt just a slight foreboding feeling remembering ginny words before the bonding all doubts faded though when a brilliant golden orange light flew from ginny wand to the shield which with a glow of pure white light became complete a lion with a scar on its forehead a bear with vibrant red fur a brown fox and a cat which looked remarkably like fortuna only with red hair where the black was were engraved neatly on to the ancient shield harry hung it back on the wall harry said so what now we re superwizards not quite but i think if we concentrate hard enough we should be able to do spells better than before think of all the things we can learn but take out your marauder map harry let see if we can still find anyone to rescue harry took out the map unfolded the rumpled bit of parchment waved his wand over it and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good the four friends gathered around the map in frantic search for any of their classmates or professors they scanned the grounds seeing frightful numbers of wizards crowding the forbidden forest hagrid hut and the quidditch field there yelled ginny luna lovegood and neville longbottom were hiding in a storage cupboard in the girls prefect bathroom the closest death eater was a man named john krensten he was standing a corridor away from the bathroom they saw they had a chance to rescue luna and neville okay we ll go under the invisibility cloak and started hermione i on it you three stay here said harry no wait dontwe all need to go asked ron no none of you can apparate in hogwarts we might be able to apparate now that we used the shield dontbe silly it focuses our power it doesnt give us new powers yeah but still we dontknow if you can apparate or not what makes you think you can you might splinch yourself trust me i can i ve done it twice now unconsciously hermione ron and ginny looked suspicious ron however said okay if you say so harry turned before he swung his invisibility cloak over himself stay here unless you find anyone else well alone donttake any chances look who talking retorted ron please all right i ll be back harry potter was now swiftly bending away the rules of hogwarts anti apparition charms he found himself in the girls prefect bathroom right in front of the closet in which luna and neville were hiding luna neville it me harry he called sweeping off his cloak they jumped out of the closet luna putting harry under the full body bind and neville shooting a stunning curse randomly mmffhpmmh cried harry his entire body stiff as cardboard with a gasp of recognition from luna and a wave of her wand harry was released from the curse c mon grab on to me i taking you to the saferoom harry snapped immediately but you cantapparate in hogwarts began luna watch me c mon we donthave much time harry was slightly nervous himself despite his confident words he could apparate himself around hogwarts now but could he manage with passengers he would have to try luna and neville hung on tight to harry who tried to apparate away he couldntmanage closing his eyes in concentration as he tripped over the hem of his robes and fell face first into a toilet bowl eww said neville luna giggled harry stood spat out a mouthful of disgusting water and said scourgify he may have cleaned himself but he still had a most unpleasant taste in his mouth ugh one at a time then one at a time luna you go first dontworry about me said neville in a rather mushy tone harry would ve laughed had the situation not been so grave he thought this should be aired on television as a soap opera or something life truly was a drama at least with him it was i ll be back in a second assured harry and this time with just one person hanging on to him he apparated away to the marauder room it worked much to his relief harry dropped luna off on the leather sofa and nodding to ginny who was sitting there watching anxiously he apparated back from the warm safety of the marauder room back to the cold empty prefect bathroom for neville unfortunately neville wasntthe only one there get down harry cried neville barring the girls bathroom door a single wizard in black robes lay at neville feet stunned harry dived at neville and apparated himself out just as he heard a crack signaling that the death eaters had broken in through neville barricade as harry let out a sigh of relief as he saw marauder room again he slumped down on to the sofa slung his arm around ginny and sighed who next we donthave much time they know we re somewhere in hogwarts now harry look as ron passed harry the marauder map he could not believe his eyes a massive amount of dots were huddled in the great hall it would ve been terrifying had these dots all been death eaters but it was even worse the dots in the middle represented students and a few professors harry could see that they were being held hostage by another few hundred dots surrounding the room death eaters and some dots labeled with question marks harry assumed they were dementors or trolls harry knew what these hostages were being used for bargaining material we have to get them out how we apparate and grab four at a time and then has it occurred to you there is no chance at all of doing that successfully yes and that why it called magic any other survivors no they re either dead or they ve escaped i suggest we leave the castle too before we find that we can t we cantleave those people there exclaimed harry we donthave a choice said ginny yes we do dumbledore once said to us we must do what is right not what is easy we stand no chance against thousands of troops they re probably within seconds of finding us here now its not a time to listen to dumbledore words of wisdom harry drew himself up to his full height his eyes flaring up in anticipation of a fight i will not leave them there to be bargained with ron held up his hand we need dumbledore for this we need help harry he gone he dead we re on our own no the time travel spell november 1993 hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster office alternate timeline professor dumbledore said harry stumbling into the headmaster office it filled his heart with warmth to feel fawkes the phoenix sing a note watch the flames flicker in dumbledore lively fireplace and the many ornaments that the headmaster owned all of which were packed away now in mcgonagall office there was a distinct smell to dumbledore office one that harry had grown to like in his constant trips to it in his seventh year harry questioned the headmaster standing up with a look of concern in his eyes what happened to you professor i not the harry you re used to a long story short we come from a not so distant future things have happened in the next four years many bad things dumbledore after searching harry eyes for a few minutes said you must be here under a spell then but how did you you told us how to said hermione speaking up but i wouldnthave i wouldntgive up that bit of information until i know i about to dumbledore noticed the ashen looks on the six students faces and stopped oh my i think i need a seat why dontyou all tell me what happened and take your time i believe this is going to be a remarkable tale february 4th 10 32am primary timeline hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry great hall severus snape flew backwards again and was hit by yet another volley of cruciatus curses through his dimly conscious mind he heard sneers of chose the wrong side now didntyou severus and things to that extent would the pain ever stop was there still anything in the world other than pain severus snape did not know and frankly he found that he did not care he wished for death it was the end their defences had failed and in consequence hogwarts was over many of his students lay dead next to him others stunned and taken into captivity or just left sitting there to die his fellow colleagues were rounded up with him although none of them subjected to the horrible torture he endured yet the strongest fortress of the days of the dark lord first reign had fallen the world would soon follow and he did not care pain dug into him like paper cuts on every millimeter of his skin he felt like piranhas were eating his organs out bit by bit eventually reaching his brain he screamed but no sound came out it was hell he could not remember why he was here who he was or what was happening to him severus snape knew just pain and pain was all he held on to dangling above death he wanted to sever the last connection binding him to life to end this torturous existence and all of a sudden it stopped the pain disappeared he remembered tears slid down the dignified man sunken cheeks he wished so very much for rest with a last look upwards he saw a frenzied crowd of death eaters and trolls blundering around at the center of the commotion stood a foolish black haired boy he did not like the boy but all the same he wished he could help him but it was time for rest others would have to help him this wasnthis battle his eyelids closed and for severus snape all went black torrentoria acido yelled ginny sending a rain of acid at a group of death eaters who were guarding the prisoners they shrieked as the acid burnt through their robes and started digesting their skin how ginny did this without regret at all showed how war had hardened the beautiful once innocent girl it had been a month for ginny and her friends discussing strategies and practicing spells in the safety of professor dumbledore safe house in the rocky mountains listening to the words of advice the old wizard had for them when they had returned to the besieged hogwarts ginny saw a dark fire burning in harry eyes as he blew open the doors to the great hall had immediately cast a dementor banishing spell whilst his patronus charged off the rogues that escaped it she hermione luna neville and ron were in charge of releasing the prisoners harry stood eyes flaring staring at voldemort with utmost hatred ginny rolled over on the floor and threw a portkey to a group of fourth years she watched with triumph as they disappeared from the great hall tempus immobulis shrieked hermione wow ginny thought leave it to hermione to think of a spell to stop time ginny herself had been amazed that it actually worked although harry had told her of something that dumbledore did to a similar effect just knocking out the other people in the room harry ginny and hermione were the only ones still moving as time stood still harry had a large cut on his left arm which was bleeding freely c mon i dontknow how long this ll hold portkey everyone away free the teachers and older students we need them snapped hermione the three of them instantly did as they were told saving about fifty of the students before hermione spell faded harry was immediately hurled backwards by a shout of flipendo hermione managed to just portkey another five people out of hogwarts before she too was hit by a jet of light she fell assumedly stunned ron let out a strangled cry and the words coming out of his mouth ginny never expected to hear from her beloved brother mouth avada kedavra hermione attacker fell dead ron eyes still blazing struck at any death eaters possible soon many experienced war hardened wizards were avoiding him almost as much as they avoided harry who had also turned furious ginny with waves of her wand freed professors moody mcgonagall and orion who upon snapping awake took several seconds to analyze the situation and immediately joined harry and ron in attacking the people around she had also then revived hermione who had thankfully been hit by a confundus curse it was a miracle that none of them fell to any curses in fact it seemed as if the death eaters and their lesser ranks of dark wizards were hurting themselves and their allies more than harry ron and the professors were luna neville and ginny were rallying the students to gather together whilst sending off rogue curses at the death eaters tempus immobulis shouted hermione again as time stopped for the second time this time more people were immune death eaters as well voldemort was squaring off with harry and moody harry silenced the six of them that actually did stay up with parasite curses followed by shockwave curses that flipped them into their own comrades harry pumped up with the wizards energies broke into voldemort ranks with the powerful curses ginny could see that the death eaters hit directly by harry spells fell dead everyone grab a portkey and leave shouted hermione who had risen to the leader of this battle a sixth fraction of the students had been evacuated others were fighting or had in the most part been killed the professors excepting moody orion and mcgonagall joined hermione in a tight circle hanging onto an old goblet disappearing hermione had dragged along severus snape with them who was lying unconscious ginny grabbed onto harry luna ron neville blaise and a couple of fifth and fourth years and started to portkey away when hermione spell broke and voldemort forces awoke harry before anyone could stop him broke away from their circle and ran towards what was left of the students ginny yelling out in fright and despair was jerked away from hogwarts and with it harry the last she saw was harry standing tall and proud fortuna on his shoulder eyes glowing reflecting many jets of light sent at his master the pair of them facing voldemort wizards and trolls who were closing in on him and the remnants of the students that had not been portkeyed away in a tight circle like a ring of vultures descending on a dead animal corpse a tear slid down ginny cheek as she landed in sunny phuket at thailand she feared for him so very much sry it been awhile but i was out of town well here are the next two chapters twilight evabandmamber13 chapter eighteen away and back harry was scared no one could see it of course but he was he and about twenty other students and professors stood surrounded by voldemort troops their wands were on the floor harry felt his two spare wands in their holsters but he could not reach for them as there were about ten wands pointed right at his head no one attacked no one moved no one even dared breathe so potter voldemort stood harry glared at the snake like man towering above him many times you ve escaped me how this was so is beyond my comprehension but this time as you see you have no way out i sure of it i underestimated you for the last time potter now before you die i have some questions to ask of you harry did not speak he felt professor orion shake next to him even the hardened witch was scared where is the headquarters of the order of the phoenix harry didntreply crucio how dare you hesitate to obey the beam of light was reflected before it reached harry a troll started shrieking beside voldemort quiet fool avada kedavra said voldemort the troll fell dead immediately death eaters started shuffling uneasily you will not tell me potter voldemort burnt a hole through harry with his piercing slits of eyes no riddle so be it kill a student for every minute he hesitates until he sees fit to succumb to reason with that voldemort swept out of the great hall avada kedavra yelled a death eater his voice was strangely familiar a boy harry knew as the sixth year hufflepuff francis fell dead he hung his head wallowing in guilt students shrieked in fear begging harry to tell voldemort but he couldn t he had to be strong a wide eyed first year fell dead he could not break down dennis creevey looked up at him with cold unseeing eyes the next victim of the death eaters he was the boy who lived beautiful hannah abbot was next she died with a fiery look of defiance in her eyes the world lied on his shoulders a third year girl he couldntdrop it sarah livingston a sixth year ravenclaw the order of the phoenix was too important jake gardener one of the boys harry had caught snogging in the astronomy tower lifetimes ago when such matters were not seen as trivial could he fight them by himself a tiny second year hufflepuff he couldntfight this many by himself a fifth year prefect he snapped just when harry was about to whip out his wands and cast spells around in a last desperate attempt to defeat the death eaters the doors of the great hall flew open once more harry raised his eyes to the door a gasp escaped his throat salvation was here it seemed as though the whole wizarding population of great britain had been piled into the great hall although they were really only hundreds strong led by what was left of the ministry aurors called together by arthur weasley and the order of the phoenix wizards and witches of all ages came to hogwarts rescue it was an urgent message from ginny and ron weasley that had alerted their father to the fall of hogwarts and that the boy who lived was still inside they called together everyone they could on short noticed and stormed hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry it was utter chaos for two hours the battle had spread out of the great hall which was littered with corpses to the extent of the entire hogwarts grounds at the top of the divination tower harry potter and tom riddle dueled parasitran magica roared harry brandishing dumbledore wand his spare wand in his other hand his primary wand still lay hidden in the holster inside his robe voldemort waved his wand wordlessly and the spell was deflected cantyou see potter you cannot win you cannot hurt me i am lord voldemort he cackled insanely harry hurled a stunning spell at him in the middle of his laughter it hit voldemort straight in the chest but after stumbling just a second he regained posture crucio shouted voldemort thanks to fortuna the light bounced away and shattered the window of trelawney classroom maximus reducto yelled harry voldemort with a wave of his wand deflected the spell back towards harry as he jumped out of the way just in time and watched a massive hole get blasted through the tower he began to get desperate how could he defeat an enemy that could not be hurt his time was running low he ducked a jet of green light his options were incredibly limited voldemort now slowly moved to corner harry harry shot spells from jelly legs to reductor spells all to no avail he was slowly beginning to be pressed to the wall voldemort shouted something that harry could not make out and he found his wands flying away from him he was now helpless feeling around in his robes he felt the last wand if only your little muggle loving girlfriend could see you now see you the great mighty harry potter all at my mercy i have waited sixteen years for this to happen yet every time i got you in my grasp you somehow slithered away from me how very slytherin i believe you would ve done well had you not had your pathetic morals but alas wands lost friends dead utterly abandoned and alone in the world it is your time to die voldemort waved his wand and harry flew backwards crushed against the wall his wand lay vibrating lightly in its holster harry although wincing with pain stood up again but fear not potter soon i will send her along with you with you out of the way the ministry under my control nothing will stand in my way i shall be the master of the world voldemort waved his wand again and yet again harry was thrown into the wall with much more effort this time he managed to stand up again blood flowing freely from his bashed up body he dared not move to his wand yet but why potter why had you chosen this unrewarding foolish path of the good wizards know you not by now that there is only power and those too foolish to seek it why had you not taken my hand when i offered you the choice to greatness nearly seven years ago i do not understand why is one so intelligent at the same time so foolish how did this come to pass again lord voldemort waved his wand harry felt a bone crack in his shoulder his robes were now started to dampen with blood again he stood glaring into voldemort eyes because there are things in the world worth fighting for fool what is there in the world worth fighting for friendship peace happiness honor love voldemort spat in one life one will have to make a choice one can do what is easy or what is right i choose to do what is right then you shall die as voldemort lifted his wand harry knew it was now or never whipping out his final wand he roared eclatez totalus as he saw the white light shoot out of his wand up into the ceiling he jumped out through the hole in the tower clutching on to fortuna for dear life divination tower exploded into a thousand pieces percy weasley was locked inside a small but reasonably well furnished room in the darkness of riddle mansion he heard footsteps outside his room every hour or so but other then that he had nothing but food a book about previous ministers of the magical society a bed and memories to entertain him it was almost a month now since he had stormed out of the burrow in anger telling his parents to never expect to see him again he never thought it would really come to pass he had just been preparing to apparate when he had been hit by a spell and next thing he knew he was placed in front of lord voldemort throne he had been interrogated thank god he didntknow most of the order secrets he had somehow managed to prevent himself from telling lord voldemort about the location of the headquarters but two days ago the worst had happened word came from the death eaters talking outside his room that what was left of the light wizards had been driven out of britain harry potter the last of them to leave it made percy feel very lonesome had all of his family made it out alive despite his arguments with his mother and father he did love his family very much especially his baby sister ginny she was a princess in his eyes from the very first day he saw his mother cradle her in her arms he wondered how ginny was doing now or even if she was alive a tear slid down his cheek as he thought about his family things hadntgone well and if one of them had been hurt or killed even he didntknow how he would manage to forgive himself his door burst open all of a sudden and none other than lord voldemort stood in front of him weasley stand up percy stood although he did it very grudgingly after all there was no use in getting himself killed i have a job for you then you may have your freedom harry shrieked a sobbing ginny weasley running towards the arms of the seventeen year old boy that was her boyfriend and so much more the blood drenched harry potter stumbled through the five star muggle hotel in phuket drawing many stares and awed gasps ginny he whispered oh god you re hurt come on up to the room slowly ginny walked with harry up to room 2300 the presidential suite and led him in oh my god ron harry here yelled hermione ron and hermione sprinted up to harry who held up an arm weakly to stop them please let me go take a bath and fix myself up i need some time harry sunk into the bathtub bubbles around him closing his eyes cuts bruises and scrapes burnt as he sunk into the luxurious pool like bathtub full of hot water it all replayed in his mind he had been amazed how voldemort managed to survive when the very ground on which he stood had been blasted into dust harry could not fathom when he and fortuna had managed to apparate back to the great hall harry expected an easy getaway he didntcount on seeing voldemort kill a first year right in front of his face we have you all now put down all your wands and turn facing the wall harry had turned bent down then flipped right up and stuck his wand at voldemort throat kicking his wand out of his hand in that second the rescue party and the teachers had stuck their wands towards the closest death eaters and received four wands at their own heads we have you now drop all your wands let us go and your leader lives another day you cannot kill me voldemort had hissed maybe not but an explosion inside your lungs will sure hurt you for a very very long time you wouldntdare you would kill everyone in this hall i wouldntdare try me you have three seconds three two all right allow potter and his little friends to leave inteltransverto harry had said pointing at arthur weasley and the professors rendezvous point at dumbledore safe house in the rocky mountains be there as soon as you can i have important news accio wands harry had shouted as the wands flew towards him he yelled multiplicus diffindo all the wands snapped into splinters they were free to go turning his wand back on voldemort he motioned for everyone to leave as he saw the last man leave he apparated away he had left with a strange feeling in his stomach it had despite many deaths occurring seemed too easy he knew voldemort could manage wandless magic but why he had not used any harry would never find out steam now filled the bathroom the door opened harry immediately covered himself with bubbles hi harry he gasped ginny was standing at the door a mischievous glint in her eyes a smile tugging on the corners of her lips gin what are you doing here i taking a i not wearing clothes ginny giggled i know but she walked closer step by step he could count the freckles on her face now despite the heavy steam and the fact that he had no glasses on still closer she came by now he could see his own eyes reflected in ginny s she bent slowly down towards him teasing him you know you really scared me there she said stroking a finger across his cheek playfully ginny ron is dontyou think and she shut him up with a kiss all the guilt all the sadness all the evils of the world were washed away as he pulled ginny to him his mind went blissfully and totally blank he forgot about ginny older brother and best friend sitting outside in the hotel suite he forgot about the people that died because of him and most importantly he forgot about lord voldemort all that mattered was ginny she was the only one in the world she wasntgoing to be happy about getting all wet he thought dimly as he pulled ginny into the large bathtub with him a part of him thought dimly from the back of his mind he felt her smooth skin on his her soaked t shirt weighing down on him his mind was filled with sensations as he kissed her deeply pulling her to him tightly on second thought maybe she wouldnteven notice she was wet at all it was a cold rainy day when harry ginny hermione and ron arrived at the safehouse with a couple more students in tow including luna neville and blaise zabini no one spoke harry raised his wand allow me entrance i am harry potter the next thing he knew he stood in a red and gold room none of his friends beside him hedwig swooped down and landed on harry bag only to hear a meow of protest come from fortuna who had been sleeping calmly in harry bag hedwig flew off again looking quite insulted hello anyone here harry oh we were so worried where is ginny and ron and hermione shouted mrs weasley who harry had just seen come through the door holding her wand to see who it was mum a girlish voice squealed happily behind them the sixteen year old girl leaped into her mother arms like a little child hugging her a smile of innocence on her girlish features harry had never seen ginny look so innocent and child like before and he found that he rather found it nice but by now ron hermione luna neville and a couple of fifth years had come into the room and mrs weasley had rounded on her youngest son and his girlfriend members of the order including tonks kingsley mr weasley mundungus fletcher and snape walked in their faces grave snape was on a wheelchair his face pale his eyes still full of pain bandages covering almost every inch of his body harry started feeling sympathy for the potions master it better be good whatever you have to tell us potter because now the whole of britain is under voldemort control with barely any opposition shouted snape there went the sympathy he cannot be killed what nonsense is this snapped snape tom riddle is immortal nonsense repeated snape not so i sent a killing curse at him before it hit him and he got back up i thought it must ve been some fluke on my part but the last battle he proved it divination tower the destruction it was my doing and voldemort wasnteven scratched murmurs went through the crowd of people that had gathered around at this we must find another way we cannot kill him so we must detain him we cannot defeat him so we must compromise him we cannot bargain so we must force him to defeat but how severus cried mcgonagall what get dumbledore pensieve i think now is the moment in which it can be opened as snape ran out of the room and up the stairs mcgonagall led the crowd into the living room which harry had gotten to know well in his time here in the alternate timeline apparently not much changed during the four years besides that now it was filled with members of the order and the auror divisions mcgonagall led the other students aside apart from ginny ron and hermione handing them each a bar of chocolate patting them on the back and waving her wand in a whirl all of the students were gone portkeys harry had never really liked portkeys but recently they seemed to be so very important in his life saving hagrid saving all the other students killing cedric dontthink about that mr weasley miss weasley mr potter and miss granger you have a choice now your parents have granted you with this choice to make on your own you may return to london and join the resistance stay here and try to find a way to stop you know who or you may leave for boston massachusetts in the academy of magical arts in america please take your time and think this through clearly mcgonagall swept out of the room leaving harry ginny ron and hermione feeling under pressure and quite alone i going back spoke harry first and what you said yourself that you couldntkill voldemort what are you going to do countered ginny anything more people cantdie because of if you finish that sentence with the word me i will slap you okay okay more people cantdie because of harry potter harry felt a hand smack across his face but i didn t he spluttered indignantly i never said anything about not slapping you if you ended it with the words harry potter smiled ginny sweetly my place is with the war you all i belong in the fray i will return to london we follow harry are you all sure yes professor no harry we are on an equal basis now call me minerva harry raised an eyebrow at this he wouldnthave expected to hear words like that come from minerva mcgonagall mouth anytime soon if this truly is your choice i fear this may be one of the last times we meet again it has been an honor to teach you and watch you grow harry i hope that we shall meet again whether it be in the war or after it if i have any news i assure you that it will be brought such stiff formalities harry didntknow how to handle he settled for saying thank you minerva the honor was all mine simple perhaps but to the point go to grimmauld place i believe it is one of the last few places where our forces gather these portkeys will take you there harry took the portkey he nodded at ron ginny and hermione and he with a tug on his navel disappeared to grimmauld place hermione hugged mcgonagall tightly by far mcgonagall had always been hermione favorite teacher save perhaps for dumbledore hermione then took a portkey and followed harry mr weasley said mcgonagall quite briskly professor mcgonagall a nod was shared between them and understanding finally passed through the student and teacher that were so unalike then came ginny ginny weasley may you watch over that boy he truly is our last hope i will professor ginny weasley then taking a portkey left the safehouse and traveled at light speed to grimmauld place as she found herself landing on her back she was pulled up by a familiar face with green eyes eyes full of such energy such power eyes capable of loving so much yet hating so much eyes that she fell in love with from the first time she saw them she knew then she would do anything for him her own voice echoed in her mind i will percy sighed ginny a few minutes a short redheaded girl bounced through the door with a delighted squeal of percy you re okay his sister ginny she jumped onto his bed crossed her legs and hugged her brother with a childish glee what happened to you percy percy was guilt stricken about what he was about to do the delighted grin on his baby sister face disappeared slightly as she looked at him again percy it okay ginny it okay he patted her awkwardly on the arm i missed you percy said ginny softly the angelic smile back on her face i missed you too sis memories flew unbidden to his head it was a warm day he was eating ice cream at diagon alley holding a banana split in one hand his sister hand in his other it was not often he could be treated to ice cream and since his mum offered him a few sickles to treat himself he decided to bring ginny also percy can i have some please he spooned half his banana split onto her tiny plate thank you percy little ginny had exclaimed anything for our little princess he had replied he truly loved his little sister he studied his sister no longer was she the five year old that had followed him around diagon alley sitting in front of him was a sixteen year old girl all grown up she still had her weasley hair of course but hers was different from the males of the other weasley children instead of bright flaring orange hers was like a rainbow of red from colors as dark as burgundy to strands of orange blonde all depending on the angle the light hit her hair she still had her freckles which she had despised when she was young she still had her deep brown eyes full of emotion and innocence she still had her beautiful smile which lit your soul making you feel better just be looking at her she still was his sister and he still truly loved her and as tears flowed down his cheeks he told her so i leave tonight thought percy no one especially not his sister would be killed because of him some things survival was worth trading for love was one of them harry who could not sleep again sat by the dying embers of the fire in grimmauld place it was lucky that this insomnia struck him then for he saw percy weasley sneaking out the door just that minute with a satchel slung over his shoulder following he decided to see just where percy was going hey percy he said from the shadows percy jumped wh who who there relax its just harry what are you doing i have to go this slightly alarmed harry where look do you promise not to tell anyone harry was starting to get a bit suspicious depends on where it is riddle mansion fast as a bullet harry drew his wand out and pointed it at percy why put your wand away harry i not a death eater harry slowly lowered his wand but kept a firm hold on it it all started one day when i left the burrow in a rage harry crept behind a rock waiting for voldemort to arrive to percy it was a plan they had carefully engineered over the last few days as voldemort apparated in percy would talk to him distracting him momentarily he harry would have to infiltrate riddle mansion to look for clues on voldemort weaknesses it was a desperate plan with so many death eaters guarding the mansion but between his invisibility cloak and his own prowess in dueling he thought he d be okay who knows he might even be able to get some useful information he was cut out of his thoughts as a loud crack was heard he immediately apparated out he had precious few minutes revealem he said the spot where the mansion was supposed to be flickered in front of harry eyes strangely he didntsee anyone guarding it voldemort front door would have to pay the price yet again reducto he whispered the door blew off its hinges the invisibility cloak over him harry walked around the house where should he start he walked to the throne room stupid move he thought to himself voldemort surely wouldntput anything of value in front of all of his followers he found a death eater secretly munching on what looked like a half finished pumpkin pasty pig harry thought slipping past the death eater into the next hallway harry knew that he definitely wouldntfind anything worth examining on the ground floor no what harry needed to find were the towers and the dungeons where voldemort probably spent his nights if he slept at all was that man still human enough to sleep if so how did he close his eyes the man had no eyelids harry didntknow and he didntreally care none of this mattered as long as he found something useful to bring back to the order after what seemed like hours harry found it voldemort own chambers but he stopped wasntit a bit too easy he had just broken through all of voldemort defences without so much as batting an eyelash it just didntseem right that what should ve been the most secure place in the world save perhaps grimmauld place would be so easy to infiltrate luck was truly with harry then he had decided to come on a day in which voldemort forces had practically emptied out to fight the muggle army also unknowingly harry mere magical resonance deactivated many of the security charms and above all harry was lucky that he had gotten in the room unnoticed by the dozen death eaters standing right next to him it was an exquisitely decorated room fit for a god there was a massive yew throne like chair by a majestic mahogany desk with ancient engravings on it the bed was a green silky texture and was very neatly made with three pillows and a blanket that looked somewhat like dragon scales by the glass bedside table he saw a book entitled kama sutra for the elderly pig but next to it was harry goal a leather studded journal it read t m r on the cover underlined by the words the great lord voldemort harry reached for the journal only barely remembering ron words during his second year magical books could be dangerous but he opened the journal nonetheless flipping to a random page in the middle of the book harry read the veil has been recovered from the ministry fools guards were of a foolishly poor standard my loyal servants took care of them easily lucius has not recovered from potter memory spell the boy is truly powerful if i the great lord voldemort cannot reverse it it is of no consequence with my loyal servants positioned at hogwarts the boy shall soon be mine with his death no one shall be able to stop me a diary was tom riddle memory downfall in harry second year it might just prove to be his downfall again old habits die hard harry thought he didntknow that he was holding in his hand the key to voldemort downfall as he silently slipped the diary into his pocket and leaving unfortunately for harry as he closed the door behind him after leaving a few rather unpleasant surprises for voldemort courtesy of the weasley twins he heard a voice behind him luck was a double sided sword it worked both ways when you want it and when you desperately dontwant it potter it was draco malfoy and he didntlook like he was here for fun and cookies harry knew what had to be done he whipped off his invisibility cloak whipped out his wand and shouted evanesco the invisibility cloak disappeared it been a while malfoy not long enough for my taste well i d love to stay and chat but i really must be going not quite yet we have some business to settle i believe you are responsible for these said draco waving his hand carelessly at his magical eyes harry grasped his wand tight adrenaline was flowing through his veins funny thing it is potter you causing me to lose a precious thing that is my natural eyes has caused you to lose something valuable to you also if it wasntfor the dark lord wanting to kill you himself you would be dead just like this he snapped his fingers what are you talking about malfoy you cantkill me you canteven stop me from leaving now oh really the magical eyes danced around crazily in their sockets harry felt a wave of foreboding as he heard draco tones yes really said harry try leaving when your mudblood slut is here with me sneered draco as he flicked his wand three house elves popped up to them carrying what looked like a big yellow crystal what harry questioned with another flick of his wand the crystal turned transparent he gasped in shock it was hermione she looked like she was in some kind of enchanted sleep with just her ripped remains of undergarments covering her body not nearly enough her face was illuminated palely in the crystal little bitch came in right after you looking for you i assume did you forget something maybe this to harry shock he found that malfoy was carrying his watch without his watch and without fortuna it meant that he had no protection beside for his own wand he wondered why malfoy wasntcalling for any death eaters he must want a big showdown one on one a fight for dominance a fight not just for survival but for hermione malfoy must of thought the same thing with a wave of his wand the doors flew shut they raised their wands harry shot one last glimpse at hermione motionless body was she even alive he sure hoped so malfoy inclined his head a bit a duel just like five years ago this time they d see who won that unfinished battle harry nodded his head back he glared straight at malfoy three offered harry years of hatred flamed up in both of them two replied malfoy years of competition were blown up within their souls one said both of them in unison time to vent it all out twilight evabandmamber13 chapternineteen the duel and the veela multiplicus serpensortia harry roared giant cobras flew out of his wand attack the boy try and free the girl flipendo harry ducked just in time a table smashed into the wall and cracked voldemort wouldntbe very happy about that the watch and fortuna always bouncing jets of light off him gave him too much self confidence draco malfoy was sharper than harry would like to admit snakes slithered to hermione crystal c mon c mon harry thought ducking a stunning spell he hollered what the matter malfoy scared to kill me afraid your precious little snake of a master will punish you crucio spat malfoy harry rolled away and laughed stellartica lumare bright white light filled the room malfoy didnteven flinch damn stupid move potter the guy doesnteven have real eyes impedimenta protego stupefy protego harry smirked at malfoy who was fuming crucio the spell hit harry just as he yelled torrentoria flamare as harry writhed on the floor in pain yelling out giant black clouds rose above malfoy spitting fireballs down at his face he jumped nimbly away from most of them but a fireball smacked straight into his face draco let out an inhuman roar of agony his hands holding the side of his face when he let go again harry saw that skin had been burnt straight off he could see the bleeding flesh in a place the skull itself emmendo frectupendus harry jumped away from the gutting charm used on fish to remove their insides stupefy a close miss harry was getting tired from all the dodging he didnthave the energy to cast any more spells incendio shouted draco as harry rolled aside the hem of his robes catching fire he saw a chance draco was busy observing harry robe being burnt a sick smile on his face evidentially he thought harry would soon be burning up skeledestructo it hit one of draco feet another yell of pain but he still stood on his one good foot flipendo harry gasped with one hand still beating the fire out on his robes draco was sent flying harry extinguished the fire by then draco got up his eyes glinting dangerously harry wasntone to attack an opponent when they were down so he raised his wand ready to counterattack whatever draco was about to throw at him he didntanticipate draco moving to shoot a spell at hermione harry blinked a second later hermione crystal flew open she awoke with a yell hermione watch out harry hollered oh hello harry draco dear what are we doing here what was wrong with her harry thought to himself hermione this is riddle mansion he s urgh harry let out a shout of disbelief as hermione walked over to draco and held his hand tightly she pressed her body tight up to draco s what was going on draco had a devilishly twisted smile on his face not good he slowly realized draco had confounded hermione given her a love potion or something hermione come here he on the other side it me harry i know perfect well who you are thanks hermione eyes they werentbrown anymore they were an amethyst color harry had never seen anyone with that color eye besides for a lady he saw on tv advertising for contact lens but why put contact lens on he was puzzled draco held hermione closer to him and she giggled before starting to kiss him a sight that harry never dreamed he d see or even hear of ewww harry yelled unable to control himself anything that snogged malfoy had four legs was incurably ugly or else was inanimate and didnthave a mind of its own last time he checked hermione was none of those things hermione what are you doing his voice had become weakened crystallize draco said hermione was once engulfed in the crystal again what on earth just happened love potion entrancement charm imperius curse and confundus curse hopelessly vulnerable and good for a shag too may i say she is good in bed for a mudblood bastard crucio harry roared draco merely stepped away the spell zipped dangerously close to hermione crystal careful potter you try to leave or you attack me one more time and your little mudblood dies now drop your wand or she dies now how many times had he heard this by now countless he really wished he had his watch now he had set it so that a portkey would activate merely by him telling it verbally to he sighed he d have to do this the hard way accio crystal as the crystal came flying towards him he spun around and pointing his wand at the doors he yelled alohomora nothing happened malfoy smirked you see potter there is no escape accio crystal protego funnily as the spell was rebounded a big diamond necklace flew towards harry from malfoy women jewelry malfoy i ll have you know that was made from the finest harry didnthave time for this pointing his wand for the floor this time he yelled maximus reducto a massive hole opened in the floor and grabbing the crystal containing hermione he dropped down to the floor below potter you leave this house with her you ll never find a way to free her from the crystal or the charms only i can release her and bring her back to the way she was before he heard draco voice come from the floor above damn malfoy harry thought bitterly by now some death eaters had come to investigate the source of the racket harry had caused in blowing a hole through the floor another day then malfoy harry thought to himself it wasntworth sacrificing himself and hermione on malfoy word but could he apparate from such strong wards and in addition holding a massive crystal in his arms he grabbed the crystal and tried he d find a way to free hermione if they got out of this place you re bluffing malfoy harry said out loud the words came out at grimmauld place he really hoped that malfoy was indeed just bluffing malfoy it transpired had not been bluffing or at least so it seemed as day after day passed everyone unsuccessful in removing hermione from the crystal everyone but ron harry and ginny had given up already mcgonagall snape and moody had taken to reading voldemort diary in search of useful information so far nothing had come up they tried brewing potions they tried charms they even tried transfiguring and banishing the crystal all to no avail harry himself was already getting restless one day when news came from moody and snape who had taken to controlling what forces the wizarding resistance had to assist the muggles snape had called an emergency meeting of the order i bring news the dark lord has struck again at the muggle army headquarters seventeen ministry officials were killed and one of ours it was dung the atmosphere went from tense to grieving in a matter of seconds a few people were stuttering no no fred and george stared at snape wordlessly their mouths hanging open the twins had always liked mundungus mrs weasley was openly crying on mr weasley shoulder harry remembered the blazing row they had the last time mundungus was in grimmauld place ginny stood tears sliding down her cheeks very visibly poor dung she whispered harry walked over to her and hugged her tightly from behind resting his chin on her shoulder harry would be strong he wouldntcry ginny jerked at first but relaxed in his arms mundugus death hit too close home for comfort determination took harry as he held ginny crying form in his arms voldemort would pay for this he would pay for all the people he had taken from the world people that deserved to live he would kill him or die trying on the third day after mundungus quiet funeral behind grimmauld place about three weeks after harry had gone to riddle mansion harry ron and ginny finally had a breakthrough it had been when all three of them were extremely frustrated and all of a sudden fortuna meowed a loud noise vibrated from the mysticat somewhat like a gong harry looked at his pet strangely then he turned to the crystal initially the crystal had started to glow red ron had let out a cry of despair and dived towards it afraid that the glow meant something negative as he went forward the crystal exploded but the hermione that came out wasntthe one that had gone after harry in riddle mansion this was the hermione that had been under malfoy spells ron who had bless him been overwhelmed with joy at seeing his best friend and his girlfriend awake again jumped and pulled her into a kiss this wasnta good idea hermione had whipped out her wand and growled touch me again weasley and i ll kill you she spat on the floor and walked out leaving a very shocked ron and ginny in the room and a very determined harry right behind her walking out of the room she never noticed the black silhouette behind her until a voice said calmly stupefy she under spells i told you two said harry to ginny and ron who had just come out of the room after him never mind that how do we stop it i dontknow we wait for snape we need some veritaserum she would have to tell us what malfoy put on her and we can find counterspells snape wontbe back for a few days exclaimed ginny no one else knows how to brew it besides hermione both ron and ginny finished for him oh i have an idea exclaimed ginny what use legilimency on who asked ron hermione you troll harry can find out how to brew veritaserum from hermione memories or i could just find out what she knows using legilimency smirked harry shut up potter but by then harry had already bent over hermione scantily clad body and muttered ennervate petrificus totalus said ron hermione body went stiff again but her eyes still open legilimens harry sunk into hermione memories it was fragmented unclear but it was enough hermione crept slowly through the door only to feel a strong arm bind her by the neck almost immediately ahh what do we have here a little mudblood why what are you doing here looking for something someone maybe hermione was determined not to let harry down she stuttered i i came to try and defeat lord voldemort the unrecognized voice laughed she shuddered as she felt hands feel her in places she most definitely did not want to be touched who who are you why dontyou remember me i remember you my mudblood it was a voice from a long time ago hermione remembered it was draco malfoy the memory changed again in bed next to draco malfoy been there for an hour harry shuddered the mental image was disgusting had to get to harry come here granger you know i think we could get to know each other better after all you are good for a mudblood you know she had slapped him and then her world was dominated shook apart all she knew was him and it wasntthe him she wanted to think about blonde hair replaced red a sneer replaced a smile cold grey eyes replaced warm blue ones everything else was merely a passing blur must tell harry watch gone no protection no way out another memory knife blood pain and everything went blank it was malfoy we know that haventyou found out anything useful yes exactly what malfoy said a love potion a confundus curse an imperius curse entrancement charm but there was something else what something dark what he did some blood magic what does that mean draco malfoy he put blood in i think it was veela blood so said ron dontyou ever pay attention in class ron scolded ginny apparently taking up hermione role what class ginny harry had cringed slightly but ginny went on unabashed veela blood spreads through your body like a virus if you drink it or get it into a wound it stays in your body until it multiplies to a certain extent until a person reaches his or her limit in holding extra magical cells so ron repeated so i have a gorgeous looking girlfriend what the problem veela can cast very complicated love charms the problem is they re very weak to love charms themselves too so are you saying draco malfoy are you saying that hermione in love with malfoy more and more each day oh i glad you didntkill him harry cause now i going to rip him limb from limb rip out his heart revive him and do it all over again shouted ron kicking an antique chair it splintered against the wall legs torn apart what do we do about hermione ron voice turned stony keep her under the curse dontwant her running back to malfoy with all of our secrets do we how could you say that ron she not herself i dontunderstand why she wasntstrong enough to fight for us for me i would ve never succumbed had i been in her situation his voice was still stony unemotional she failed me she failed us i dontunderstand why i would do anything give anything for her why didntshe do the same for me i love her but does she not love me his voice started breaking harry felt it not wise to point out that hermione probably did try to fight against malfoy curses and it wasnther fault she was like this it was his for forgetting his watch why should i live when the woman i love wonteven fight for me anymore what is the purpose his voice turned to a whisper why should i fight voldemort when i have nothing to look forward to if the day we win comes harry was amazed he had never known ron could speak with such charisma more amazing still ron words had done the trick hermione broke all of the curses for him she sprung up her eyes were still amethyst colored but it could not be clearer that ron was the only one occupying the orbs of light all sources of draco malfoy curses were gone for us ron she whispered hermione she ran into his arms looking taken aback for just one second ron returned her embrace i love you ron whispered i love you more impossible get a room you two called harry laughing merrily ginny had tears of joy in her eyes she smacked harry on the arm playfully and then burst into laughter too hugging each one of them and running out of the room howling as ginny left the room the three long time friends looked at each other with fondness they engulfed each other in a group hug they did not need words to convey their happiness at getting hermione back she knew thanks said harry to hermione thanks for coming after me to riddle mansion it meant a lot to me couldnthave stopped me replied hermione they smiled ron and hermione then shared whispered words and ron also started smiling in the midst of all the war three friends had found the value of their friendship yet again after being reminded what it would be like without one of them there harry finally didntfeel like he was a third wheel anymore this was a moment of friendship the hug purely platonic even between ron and hermione even ginny presence had not quite made it to such a level of fluid understanding that these three had for each other they went through every adventure together they understood each other as if they were an extension of each other in a sense they really were they were the three companions no they were the trio they would gladly die for each other and each one of them knew it they smiled at each other as they broke apart it was two days since hermione was released from the crystal and she was going over useful information she had retrieved from draco mind in a partial order meeting in the two days she had been up and about the changes the veela blood had caused were becoming more and more apparent her eyes grew slightly larger her hair gone straight all in all she was becoming unrecognizable as the girl that once had large front teeth untamable hair and a nose buried in books the whole day long although she still read as much as she did before it looked like she was going to become full veela anytime soon harry and ginny greatly enjoyed the sport of teasing ron waving their hands in front of his eyes that had always seemed to glaze when looking at hermione she hermione had enjoyed the attention but was starting to get slightly frustrated with him as he wasntable to string two words together when talking to her when draco had be under the imperius curse i could also delve into his mind although of course i couldntcontrol him i found out that there is a way into riddle mansion other than the foolish way in the front doors hermione waved her wand around and a miniature image of riddle mansion appeared in the air 3d and rotating slowly on the spot she waved her wand and arrows flew past harry understood first the foundations of the mansion pure marble hermione said the purpose of this is to give the mansion a solid foundation and stability against the hurricanes around la havre we can penetrate like so with another wave of her wand and complicated squiggles harry saw that it led straight into the furthest down dungeon from there strike teams can be sent to assassinate draco i mean voldemort ron gave her a piercing stare but she stared right back at him somehow ron was the one to blush yet again veela powers sure kicking in harry thought excellent granger said snape do you mind if we store this in dumbledore pensieve of course not professor snape swept out of the room god even snape is being nice to her harry thought ron was still blushing and looking anywhere but at hermione eyes harry had no idea what ron was so nervous about when he looked at hermione he felt nothing different at all besides for that he was kind of freaked out by the eye color the veela powers didntseem to have any effect on anyone else besides for ron at all he supposed that what ron felt about hermione was similar to what he felt about ginny but he quickly crossed it out his and ginny relationship definitely wasntbased on lust alone he watched her with semi detached consciousness as she curled up on the closest armchair to the fire although it was now early april and it wasntcold at all she had her eyes closed and she looked totally innocent so unlike the fiery spirit that she really was when awake harry knew she hated being seen as little and unable to take care of herself he more than many perhaps not the weasley twins who had always gotten their share of hexes when teasing their youngest sister knew that she was nothing like that at all yes ginny was beautiful but harry loved her not just for that he surely didntjust love her for her looks although they were a massive added bonus he loved her for her spirit how fun she was to be with ron didntseem to care about any spirit nonsense as he stared hungrily at hermione when she was immersed in a book ron had a wide grin across his face the boy really had a thing for part veela thought harry new eyes same thirst for reading with them potter moody growled yes its time for another visit to the muggles they just lost another battle an a big un i ll be there in a minute moody nodded and walked out of the room to find snape harry leaned over and kissed ginny who looked like she had fallen asleep but as soon as his lips grazed her cheek a smile came across her face cheat whispered harry you re the cheat said ginny crossly that wasnteven a real kiss harry bent down again and pulled away at the last second that all you ll get for now he said cheekily and ducking a slap he ran out of the room harry swept through the battle stricken muggle headquarters moody and snape behind him when they reached the general office they were immediately recognized and allowed in by the dozen men guarding the doors as harry stepped in he saw that it wasntjust the general alone there were six other people there one of them harry recognized as a member of the royal family and five other people who looked very important ah mr potter again wonderful to see you snape coughed a few weeks ago they had been hopelessly arrogant now harry suspected they were fully ready to do whatever he asked of them we ve been er considering your offers from before and we can safely say that we will provide what you need and more if you need it harry glanced at snape again the man looked like he was having trouble stopping himself from gloating okay general what do you have to propose said harry trying to be courteous he didntexpect such an answer as was followed everything we ve got harry barely stopped himself from gasping eight hundred tanks thirty five thousand infantry and the whole of the royal air force harry did gasp then well see mr potter we want this man dead and we truly believe now that you are the man to do that a battalion of troops came back from the assault on the buckingham palace yesterday saying they threw grenades and shot at this snake like man and even seeing their grenades hit target and their shells zoom towards him the man still stood unhurt you say that you are the one that can defeat him let hope you are you have our support do you have a first target yes hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the general saluted harry it shall be done call upon us when you feel need thank you general and i wontlet you down and so it was that harry snape and moody apparated out of the headquarters back to grimmauld place feeling a whole lot more optimistic than they did before the muggles now fought with them hundreds of miles away lucius malfoy awoke with a snap miraculously he remembered everything including who did this to him twilight evabandmamber13 chapter two diagon alley by the next rising of the sun the incident of the night before was put aside by harry and ginny they had both convinced themselves that it was just an awkward moment and nothing would ve happened even if they hadntbeen interrupted they greeted each other normally at breakfast and scooped up what was left of the food after ron had gotten there which was a surprisingly small amount a raspberry scone and two pieces of toast splitting the meager breakfast between themselves they walked out to the dining room where ron was furiously munching on a plateful of food and hermione was sitting next to him with a look of indignation and disgust on her face harry caught ginny eye and they both laughed ron looked up from his meal and said s matter by saying this a big blob of bacon and chewed up bread flew out of his mouth and into hermione face which caused harry and ginny to laugh even harder now that enough dears ron did you eat all of the food i set out there asked mrs weasley shaking her head you mean that was for all of us yes ron said mrs weasley oops said ron and belched gross said hermione and smacking ron on the arm left and sat next to ginny near the end of breakfast hogwarts owls had come and dropped off the yearly letters harry opened his letter and found himself very shocked indeed hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been made head boy along with ms hermione granger as head girl this position is an extremely important one in regards to recent developments in the war you are expected to provide a respectable image for the younger students and you will also be learning auror level charms and defence against the dark arts with headmaster dumbledore instead of attending regular classes for those two subjects term begins on september 1 enclosed is a list of all necessary books and equipment yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress p s the headmaster will come see you the 29th of august to discuss your appointment as head boy harry was stunned dumbledore hadnteven made him a prefect because of the responsibility put on harry by the prophecy why head boy wouldntthat be going against what he said before harry felt the supplies list in the envelope and sure enough next to it was a silver head boy badge across the table everybody in the kitchen was hugging hermione oh my god head girl yelled hermione the hogwarts owls shifted nervously head girl she shrieked again the owls took flight fleeing for their lives harry laughed everyone at the table congratulated her but also slipped in a sarcastic comment on how they knew she was going to be head girl the first day they met her hermione turned crimson beaming happily harry walked over to her and whispered in her ear so there are two gryffindor head students this year drawing away he said loudly good job hermione i knew you had it in you harry winked at hermione his sign for her not to say a word the head boy better not be some rich snooty git like malfoy ron muttered i should hope that you wouldntthink of the new head boy that way i sure he d feel very insulted indeed if you ask me i hold the new head boy in the highest esteem said harry hmm who is it ernie macmillan or something said ron wondering who else could be head boy ginny figured it out first you re head boy she exclaimed harry burst out laughing as she jumped on him for a congratulation hug he held her tightly her vibrant hair filling his eyesight ginny did not turn red or show any sign of embarrassment as she calmly stepped aside and allowed the others to congratulate harry when it came to fred and george the last to approach harry they shook their heads and announced that they were disappointed in harry the newly minted head boy had stuck his tongue out in retaliation fred and george gave their most sincere apologies but all of a sudden they whipped out their wands and inflated harry head with a yell of engorgio there you go now you look like a head boy harry his head the size of a tire fell over tilted by the weight of his head the whole table sniggered at this they all remembered fred and george torment of percy weasley finite incantatem yelled mrs weasley seconds later fred george that is enough assaulting the boy who lived look at everyone else here you re just so immature i dontknow where we went wrong in raising you two what the wizarding world would do if they heard that my sons attacked harry potter harry was laughing uproariously with everyone else insisting to mrs weasley it was really all right and he understood the humor in the situation after all harry had seen the twins at it again and again when percy was made head boy ron gave harry a strange look going back and forth from ginny to harry harry quickly realized that he had slung his arm around ginny sometime during his laughter and he let go harry had noticed however 7 weasley males looking at him strangely and mrs weasley looking at him with an expression unreadable hermione was seemingly oblivious in her joy at being made head girl a grin still plastered on her face all in all harry felt a bit nervous and somewhat guilty when ron hermione ginny and himself portkeyed to diagon alley with mrs weasley floo powder was no longer safe as dark wizards had begun to infiltrate diagon alley that way so portkeys were issued to families that were trusted other families would have to find another way in using muggle transport or broomsticks harry was unprepared for the sight of what happened to the once beautiful crowded diagon alley the streets were no longer full of happy chatting wizards and witches there were just worried looking parents shepherding children from one building to another aurors running along from one place to another and the streets no longer looked clean they were filled with scorch marks and dirt harry ron hermione and ginny made their way into the leaky cauldron where they sat down and looked at their booklist uniform three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of dragon hide gloves one winter cloak black silver fastenings casual clothes for evenings and weekends one set of dress robes for halloween yule and graduation balls course books new books needed

two hundred years when a child got his arm sliced off everyone shuddered we d best get going anyways diagon alley isntthe safe place it used to be now stick together now come on said mrs weasley the first stop was gringotts when harry remembered the letter from yesterday hang on can i sort this out i can just meet up with you guys later started harry goodness sake no you re not going anywhere by yourself ginny go with harry wontyou dear said mrs weasley ginny nodded and they approached a goblin with the letter good morning my name is harry potter ginny rolled her eyes at this point everyone knew harry by sight there was no need to introduce himself i received a letter yesterday regarding the transfer of assets from my parents and my godfather accounts continued harry yes yes griphook the goblin that had served harry the first time he had come appeared at their elbows come along now get in the cart as soon as harry ginny and the goblin stepped in the cart started moving now since your current vault wasntbig enough to store all of the money lily and james potter had left you not to mention sirius black s we have moved your account to a presidential level high security vault harry knew what a high security vault was like only by descriptions on books never did he expect to see 15 trained dragons standing at guard and double that amount of goblins standing to intercept them state your full names and stand on this block said a goblin holding a clipboard harry james potter harry walked up to the block virginia annabel weasley ginny stood up next to him the block glowed white for a second and then turned dim again security measures you ll understand muttered the goblin and let them through your vault number is 17 mr potter you may access the contents now the goblin opened the door and led them down a massive hall and started fiddling with security charms on one of the massive steel doors when he finally gotten the door open he motioned for harry and ginny to enter the room and take what they needed harry gasped it was no room it was his vault mountains of gold coins were in front of him hills of silver and a heap of bronze ginny went weak at the knees but there got to be sweet merlin harry two million five thousand two hundred and twenty one galleons fourteen sickles and two knuts said the goblin calmly in a bored voice harry and ginny were wordless until a rude well from the goblin made harry move forward he scooped massive handfuls of coins into his moneybag which he had enlarged and he reached for ginny practically empty purse and filled it to the rim with galleons ginny objected but harry insisted on it you think i ll be able to use up all of this i ll be lucky if i even live long enough to use up the coins i have here in my pouch with voldemort and all i ll probably be dead before the end of this year a loud slap echoed through the vault ginny what was that for exclaimed a very indignant harry dontever say anything like that again harry or you ll regret it you ll live and grow up happily you ll get married to a wonderful girl live your life have children watch them live their lives and even watch their children you re seventeen harry you ve still got your life ahead of you if i hear you make one more comment about you dying soon i ll dontyou realize that i people love you dontyou realize how you hurt me by talking like that i didntlove you because you were the boy who lived harry i dontcare about your destiny i care about harry just harry ginny stopped tears in her eyes she looked like she was ready to collapse and cry harry grabbed her into a hug before she could move and whispered i sorry ginny i ve just been a bit negative about it all you know with the prophecy and all harry realized how ridiculous he must ve looked hugging a crying ginny in a room full of money with twenty goblins staring at him bug eyed harry also realized quite uncomfortably that he was hugging his best friend who was dating colin creevey who harry somewhat respected now that he had gotten some character and he wasntjust hero worshipping him ginny was a taken girl and more importantly she was his best friend but she worried about him she even told him that she loved him as a friend of course he told himself memories unbidden told him that although she was dating colin she liked him the most she did have that four year crush but the question was did he still have a chance with her did he even want a chance with her no he told himself but you re not hugging her like a friend are you said a nasty little voice in harry head he held ginny in his arms as she cried choked sobs on his shoulder you missed your chance you did she obviously over you now she been dating for the past two years what she would say to you if she knew how you thought about her you re enjoying yourself even when she crying on you how horrible of you harry banished the voice from his head no he told himself ginny weasley was just a friend now their concern for each other was nothing but friendship he held her as a friend just a friend tell you what gin you keep the galleons in your purse help me carry some more up for your family and i ll never say anything like that again said harry looking down into her eyes and giving her his most winning smile ginny whispered harry that blackmail i thought you were a true gryffindor but she smiled and did as harry asked harry felt a weight drop on his stomach as she slid out of his arms harry absently thought about how warm she was and how she seemed to fit perfectly in his arms after filling pouches with gold coins they left the vault harry nodded to the goblin and watched as they went through a complex process of locking the vault when they had finished they went back up on the cart harry stole another glance at ginny harry and ginny had met ron hermione and mrs weasley in flourish and blotts where they got their schoolbooks for the year hermione picking up ten extra tomes for light reading harry would never know despite being friends with hermione for about six years how she enjoyed books so much harry hermione ron and ginny went into ollivander wand shop to buy spare wands as mrs weasley went to the apothecary for potions ingredients harry had hoped never to come to this shop again as mr ollivander had spooked him out before his first year however it was widely known that ollivander had the best wands in the world for sale so in they went and unsurprisingly mr ollivander had not changed one bit aaaah mr potter i was not aware that you d be coming holly and phoenix feather eleven inches very powerful wand indeed surely you haventlost it he muttered hello mr ollivander we all need spare wand for our year at hogwarts could we try some please said harry yes yes of course now let me get your measurements mr ollivander went to work and an hour later the four teenagers went out with new wands ron was a short 7 inch wand made of oak and unicorn hair supposedly good for charms ginny was a 9 inch willow wand with phoenix feather and hermione wand was a 10 inch long maple wand with unicorn hair however harry was a tricky customer it took mr ollivander 45 minutes to find the right wand for harry it ended up being a 12 inch long mahogany wand with a phoenix feather similar to his first wand harry paid for the wands and exited the shop where they bumped into luna lovegood wandering around seemingly without a care in the world oh hello guys lovely day isntit ron you have a cockroach on your robes said luna harry was used to this kind of greeting by now and ignored it after 15 minutes of meaningless chitchat they said their goodbyes to luna and went to meet mrs weasley at their final stop madam malkin robes for all occasions ginny had surprised mrs weasley ron and hermione by pulling out gold coins from her purse and treating them to their robes ginny winked to harry ron nearly fainted when he saw how much money was in ginny purse ron and mrs weasley were still trying to squeeze information out of ginny on how she had managed to get the money when they left the shop and headed to florean fortescue for ice cream she just informed them of a particularly nice friend who had recently hit the jackpot with an innocent smile mrs weasley exploded virginia weasley tell me who gave those galleons to you and what for harry saw the game was up and drew mrs weasley and ginny away mrs weasley i afraid its my fault that ginny has received those galleons you see we made a deal down in gringotts she would have to help me spend some money the money that my parents and sirius left me are way too much for me to spend by myself harry rummaged through his bag and pulled out a pouch that was filled with galleons and handed it to mrs weasley for all the delicious food and for being the best family i could ever hope for said harry with a grin mrs weasley like ginny declined at first yet mrs weasley like ginny was persuaded after harry put on his finest responsible adult voice and his obligations to friends and family as he put it now that he was no longer a child come on mrs weasley it would make me feel so much better if you took it said harry flashing mrs weasley a winning smile mrs weasley accepted the money at last with a smile and a hug but when she took the pouch from harry she immediately dropped it sweet merlin harry what did you put in that bag why is it so heavy exclaimed a shocked mrs weasley harry did nothing but smile as he opened the bag for mrs weasley it was magically enlarged on the inside and it was as big as the weasley family vault but filled with gold galleons unlike the practically empty weasley vault you did accept it mrs weasley i expect you to keep true to your word harry said and walked off holding hands with ginny to florean fortescue s where ron and hermione were already eating sundaes mrs weasley could be heard muttering something about hanging around fred and george too much and developing ways to trick the older generation yet she did so with a smile on her face ron and harry were just having a game of chess when the fire in the living room went green and dumbledore face appeared harry shook his head he still wasntused to people heads popping into fires harry hello professor i suppose you re wondering why i made you head boy that amongst many things professor well i have 15 minutes to spare let see how many of your questions i can answer firstly regarding the business with head boy it is as the letter says we need someone to give a good image off who better than the boy who lived also this is more important harry i have reason to believe that draco malfoy has been initiated as a death eater over the holiday i will need you and hermione to poke around a bit to try and find out anything you can i know you two are the best for the job your appointment as head boy is also due to the fact that you and hermione will be required to act alongside the teachers should a life threatening situation occur at hogwarts as we are currently undermanned the final reason is about the prophecy you will need some private time during this year i can feel it whether to prepare or just lounge about that i do not know the head boy and head girl dorms should provide you with the privacy you need i daresay miss granger wontbother you if you dontwant her to you are the most capable person for the job harry but if you think it is too much responsibility feel free to reject the position dumbledore had hit a soft spot without knowing so harry stuck to his responsibility no matter what it cost him no problem sir i honored you chose me for the position but sir what about the order of the phoenix what will be my duties there am i to come to battles and answer summons you needntworry about that unless the situation gets really out of hand for now just another powerful wizard on our side at hogwarts is good enough well harry i daresay you will have your hands full this year being quidditch captain head boy and a member of the order right harry would you mind asking permission from mr and mrs weasley and the grangers for ron hermione and possibly ginny to join the order i assure you none of you will be put into any danger it is just for security at hogwarts now what were your other questions it regarding my parents and sirius professor what did they do when they were alive how did they get so much money your father and sirius worked as aurors for the ministry and your mother worked to design new spells in the ministry also her invention of the mass disarming charm earned most of the money that you see in your vault plus the potter and black families were amongst the richest of wizards recently i sorry harry i afraid my time is up please give my regards to molly and arthur with a pop dumbledore face disappeared harry headed back to ron all you need now is a really good girlfriend harry and you ve reached my lifetime goal said ron who was obviously trying not to be jealous harry sighed he was used to ron doing this by now ron dumbledore just asked me to ask your parents whether or not you could join the order they re quite shorthanded nowadays i ll ask hermione parents too they want all three of you oh yeah and ron you re co captain for quidditch and you re a prefect you ve got just as much as i do plus a lot more you ve got wonderful parents wonderful brothers and you have ginny as your sister i not sure if anyone could ask for a better sister than her you ve got me and hermione as your friends and in case you haventnoticed you have more girls pining after you than i do after all anyone that wants to be with me is either brave delusional or has a death wish ron smiled pointing at the chessboard i only joking harry but you forgot something i a hundred times better at chess than you are harry raised an eyebrow as he sat down next to the chessboard is that a challenge weasley you bet potter get ready to lose harry and ron played until deep into the night when ron finally checkmated harry with the help of two pawns and a bishop yawning they went to bed no way forget about it ronald virginia you two will not be joining the order until you are grown up and graduated it too dangerous said arthur and molly weasley simultaneously but harry said ron and ginny harry is exceptional plus dumbledore will be keeping an eye out for him the weasley parents said as if it settled the matter hermione dear we trust the weasleys judgment you will not be joining either if arthur and molly say its too dangerous it is said mr granger dad i sorry if this annoys you but i an adult now i make my own decisions i am joining with harry whether you like it or not is not my problem hermione said calmly surprisingly mr granger did not erupt or even look angry hermione we want what is best for you but if you really want to do this you are correct it is a noble thing to do and you are an adult now my little princess is all grown up he sniffed and hugged hermione dad said hermione blushing red yes yes you re right i ll go tell your mother with that an emotional mr granger left the breakfast table ron was amazed well if hermione and harry are joining i not going to be left behind not if my life depended on it mum i an adult now too and i control my own fate with that ron walked off leaving molly weasley furious my own children are rebelling against me sniffed mrs weasley they re growing up so fast you wontdo that to your old mum will you ginny ginny looked uncomfortable probably considering if she should take advantage of the situation and just declare that she was joining the order or should she ask permission harry had no doubt that ginny had no intentions of being left behind weasley blood harry thought to himself mum please may i join i just a few months younger than ron harry and hermione i dontwant to be left behind ginny said quietly afraid to provoke her mother into tears ginny you are not of age yet you might be hurt you might be mrs weasley if you trust me enough i swear to you that i will not let ginny come to any harm i can imagine how much ginny dreads being left behind please consider letting her join i assure you as long as i am alive no harm will befall ginny harry said that was a brilliant move by harry as his words always melted molly weasley heart after a few minutes of sniffing she agreed harry gave ginny a small nod and went to find ron and hermione leaving mother and daughter to have a talk as harry walked to the living room to find ron and hermione a wizard rolled out of the fireplace remus lupin with blood splattered over the front of his robes an arrow protruded from his chest harry tell dumbledore diagon alley under siege remus fainted potter twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty one standstill you wontbelieve what just happened the muggles just pledged all of their support against voldemort cried moody looking strangely giddy which made his scarred face twist into an even more grotesque shape harry had never seen the old auror act like that at all he thought it was rather out of character he must ve believed the muggles help would sure help a lot excellent cried a few people snape however turned to hermione looking slightly ashamed of himself or something he cleared his throat um miss granger if you would that is to say will you help organize an attempt to take back hogwarts the order as you heard believe it is a pivotal point in turning the war back to our favor i that is to say we believe you one of the er brightest minds we have we could use your help we have not much time to lose should the muggle general lose faith in us of course i ll help i love hogwarts as much as any one of you do and i ll do my part in trying to take it back said hermione smiling at snape gosh even snape is being nice to her thought harry harry almost laughed at the furious expression on ron face as hermione followed snape out of the room to help with the plan ron stomped out of the living room after them leaving harry and ginny alone again silly git thought harry does he really think snape is competition for him and hermione must be out of his mind who on earth would pair snape with hermione a n err sorry to those shippers who actually do p harry did actually burst into laughter as ron stomped back in grabbed his wand and stomped right out again good news about the muggles eh offered harry turning to ginny thinking he sounded a bit off never mind that i think there something wrong with hermione what she part veela now she bound to change a bit even if it is just physically but honestly i think it going to tamper with her brain a bit too oh that would explain the makeup exclaimed ginny her cheeks flushing harry was going to make a skeptical comment about makeup and hermione and how the two were not totally independent but he decided against it speaking of makeup what do you have on your lips now asked harry instead moving closer to her with a grin across his face ginny also stepped closer tantalizingly licking those lips that harry was staring hungrily at nothing at all harry continued staring at her moist lips for what felt like an eternity and found himself bending down towards them sliding his arms around her he was about to close his eyes and let himself go when ginny pulled away at the last second now you know how it feels said ginny with a dazzling smile and ran out of the room leaving a very shocked and very lusting harry standing there with his mouth open dumbstruck after he got over his initial shock he chuckled little ginny weasley who would ve thought that it would turn out like this not i thought harry not i hermione granger sat poring over plans day in and day out images flashed through her brilliant mind blood was sapped out of her body cold pain desperation as her mind started to go dizzy and it was pumped back in the life force of all creatures alike it was warmer than before more pleasant she felt powerful yet powerless at the same time she felt more what was it an enjoyment for life everything was simple life purpose was to find love and live happily ever after delusions hermione thought to herself pure unfiltered passion his blonde hair flew through her mind his cold magical eyes unlike the old grey ones hermione had seen for six years his aura of darkness a sense of danger and excitement that she fed off of that she loved all spell induced she reminded herself harry potter vibrant green eyes a memory of the past stared straight at her they pierced into her soul like a drill digging through soft soil but beyond soil there was a hard core and it could not be broken for she was lost she was draco s forever she would become mrs malfoy she would become the mother of his children a title that she would enjoy hermione shuddered all the while trying to concentrate on the plans and then the words from her loved one keep her under the curse dontwant her running back to malfoy with all of our secrets do we how could you say that ron came harry voice she not herself i dontunderstand why she wasntstrong enough to fight for us for me i would ve never succumbed had i been in her situation his voice was still stony unemotional she failed me she failed us i dontunderstand why i would do anything give anything for her why didntshe do the same for me i love her but does she not love me his voice had broken then shattering her heart with it why should i live when the woman i love wonteven fight for me anymore what is the purpose his voice turned to a whisper why should i fight voldemort when i have nothing to look forward to if the day we win comes those words devoid of hope yet filled to the brim with emotion shattered the hard steel core that draco had built in her heart and she was freed she knew then that no matter how many curses spells and befuddlements were placed upon her her heart could not truly belong to anyone but ron weasley hermione granger looked into the mirror on the sides of the walls and finding an amethyst eyed dark haired beauty staring back at her this wasnther she thought but it was this was the new hermione she knew she should be upset about all that had happened she was for the most part but there was a strange layer of happiness that prevented her from going into tears at the mere thought of it she really should read up about veela and she would ve gladly done so had there not been such an important task at hand she turned her eyes back to the hogwarts invasion plans but memories plagued her you know for a while back then i doubted why potter and weasley put up with you but now i realize that even scarhead there would appreciate this she slapped him isntit nice when breakfast bites back chuckled draco the layer of happiness seemed to puncture all of a sudden and she found herself teary eyed why did he do that why her because i was the one who was caught thought hermione to herself imagine it had been ron she laughed aloud at the thought of it but what if the little bastard was actually a homosexual and the same thing did happen to ron he would ve fought like a cornered madman but no one deserved the torture and humiliation malfoy had put her through looking back she thought should she had been a bit smarter a bit stronger it wouldnthave happened at all hermione sighed at christmas four months ago she had told harry that he was her brother and she was his sister now she somewhat looked it it was a ludicrous idea but it was true she had always had nearly the same eye shape as harry s but none of the vitality and deepness of his eyes hers was a boring brown but now as she looked into the mirror again she saw that her eyes were pretty beautiful her hair had gone silky and darker almost black and her skin had started to pale and shine this was exactly what she had wanted when she had been a little child to have the look of a queen the elegance the posture that everyone admired instead she got a bookworm posture from her love for books and learning a love that not many people of her age appreciated or understood she giggled softly to herself as she thought about the changes even her voice had changed slightly sounding more girlish and less bossy than before almost bubbly she thought was this what she would ve wanted if she could do it all over again she hadn t in essence saved harry at all no it was her that needed saving in the end absently her mind flickered back to draco malfoy that bastard did this to her she was meant to be his slave his doll but ron had helped her break his curses for some reason she found that funny she giggled again hermione granger did not like giggling she dubbed it silly and quite vain something only bimbos like parvati patil would do but she found that it was quite okay the sound of a giggle she pondered as she listened to the sound escape from her own throat what was happening to her something good she thought to herself she looked back into the mirror again her eyes sparkled her hair caught the flickering candlelight and behind her was a red headed long nosed freckled someone ron weasley she giggled again she jumped at him nimbly landing straight into his arms in the process scattering some of the plans she had been working on she gave him a heart stopping kiss summoning all her growing veela powers to make him feel passion like he d never felt before as she closed her eyes a million images of draco flashed though her mind but at the end ron presence drove it all away again she would forget it wasntanywhere as bad as what harry had gone through she would be strong as she opened her eyes she saw ron familiar face and she had ron to help her through anything and everything just like that the thought of draco was blown away like a leaf in a windstorm she broke away from ron gasping for breath hermione looked into the mirror one last time those gem like eyes the dark straight hair through it all she could still see the bushy haired brown eyed girl who loved books hated quidditch loved ron weasley and hated draco malfoy no matter what happened to her she d always be hermione granger nothing could change that not even draco malfoy no doubts about it this time as she looked away from the mirror she smiled it done what done the plans to take back hogwarts they re finished said a drained looking hermione granger plopping down on the sofa next to harry who was playing a game of chess with ron ginny watching closely harry looked up from his game can i see snape has them he ll show everyone them tonight at the meeting when are we going to put the plan into action as soon as possible we ll need at least a few days to rally our forces and i daresay the muggles will need just as long if not longer to rally their own so what are we going to do asked ron not looking at hermione his brow furrowed staring at the chessboard i told you you ll find out tonight said hermione yawning and curling up on the sofa closing her eyes but hermione cantyou just tell us a bit no ron why because i tired oh that a load of checkmate said harry grinning in ron distraction he had moved his king right to the corner where harry with one move of his queen had him trapped oh my god squealed ginny i i what checkmate but you but i but but but i told you i d beat you one day smiled harry but no it was because i hermione opened an eye ron turned red again as he stared and stared at her ginny giggled give it a rest mate you ve beat me for seven years it about time i took a match ron nodded to himself muttering under his breath his ears still red ginny led ron out of the living room and up the staircase shooting harry an exasperated glance as she went rolling her eyes ron really could be so childish after all war was coming what was a chess game outcome when the fate of the world could be decided the next few days not much it seemed lately that not much mattered at all there was life and happiness on one side and there was death and misery on another it was their responsibility to pull the world back to the former cho it me harry we need you luna hi it ginny here its time ernie it hermione granger remember me the thing is hi neville it ron weasley here come down here for a sec it was a busy day harry hermione ron ginny and many other members of the order like tonks and kingsley were calling out everyone they knew to join in the massive assault on hogwarts voldemort now most guarded fortress much more crowded than riddle mansion they broadcasted using a telephone like floo system that involved transporting one words to another fireplace instantly much like a telephone does by nightfall however they had assembled their forces grimmauld place was crowded full of old hogwarts students all the members of the order aurors from the ministry and basically anyone that was brave enough to come all that was left to do was wait for the general to call the telephone rang two mornings later hours before the sunrise no one but the muggle general would call by the telephone hello said harry as he picked up the phone we re ready to move out we ll be at rendezvous point at 0600 excellent general we will be there sonarus harry muttered everyone get ready to go we re due in three hours and afterwards a loud voice hollered harry from outside harry ginny hermione and ron ran to open the doors what they saw amazed them it was hagrid and behind him were the giants and from the looks of it it was every last giant left in britain cho chang had been reading the daily prophet reporting yet another attack on the muggles by lord voldemort when harry voice rang from the fireplace it was a voice she had not heard since her last year at hogwarts when harry had made it clear to her that they were nothing but friends anymore as she tried to seduce him in the ravenclaw common room she had felt so lonely then so needing of a partner to share her burdens with and harry potter seemed like the perfect shoulder to cry on after all they already had a history together and they knew that they had already established feelings for each other at one point to reignite the flames wouldntbe that hard secretly she still did have some feelings for harry despite their many breakups and fights and her series of relationships afterwards she had reckoned she could banish the heart stoppingly gorgeous parvati patil from his heart after all if cho chang tried to spend a lot of time dazzling herself up she could just as easily seduce harry it had worked but she had reckoned without the little girl sister of his best friend ginny weasley she had talked to him and she found weeks of careful seduction made useless by a few words from the red headed girl cho had wondered if they had gotten together yet she in her heart of hearts knew although she had been beaten out of harry potter by this girl who didnteven try that ginny weasley was the one for him she left hogwarts bidding harry well although still slightly spiting ginny weasley it was all a matter of time before they got together she had said and upon her arrival at grimmauld place her brother and father in tow she had found that she was right in the living room relaxing on the leather sofas was harry and ginny who were snuggling together laughing about something they looked so natural and happy despite the evil situations she knew they must ve been through as she saw harry get up and wave at her she knew that she had said the right thing before harry and ginny really were meant to be and she cho would do nothing to try and break them apart she truly felt happy for them all memories of her former relationship with harry out of the way as she smiled at harry offering her congratulations about ginny he smiled back at her thanks he had said she would always remember harry after all how could anyone forget him it would be her fairy tale story to children of her own one day she had dated harry potter not many could say that and she was still his friend an honor that she felt she really didntdeserve if the war was won and if she was still alive it would be a tale worth telling indeed she looked into those tortured green eyes just slightly longingly one last time she tore her eyes away and then she knew she had closure you re welcome ginny was nervous if anything hermione had told her was like what it sounded like the upcoming battle would be massive thousands of troops on either side she stood in hogsmeade side by side with her family a bit further away stood harry and hermione going over last minute strategies and then the muggles arrived jets came roaring in so loud that ginny couldnthear anything but them tanks came rolling around the remains of hogsmeade and behind them was the river of troops the muggles had come watching them with interest ginny saw that they had all lined up in formation the engines went dead no one spoke wizard nor muggle no one even moved as every last camouflaged soldier stood saluting their general who was himself came out a jet they all looked to harry at the beckoning of the general all the wizards were also focused on him no longer there were the warm loving eyes ginny cared about every last part of harry stature was one of a war veteran he stood with his back straight and unyielding his eyes flaring his lips thin the general spoke do we have a name for our alliance how about the bonding voiced snape several people started snickering and snape surprisingly turned red and looked away all eyes turned to harry it was clear that the question was initially intended for him harry waited a few seconds before he spoke yes general everyone was focused on him dumbledore army cho chang ernie macmillan luna lovegood michael corner terry boot neville longbottom dean thomas zacharias smith angelina johnson katie bell alicia spinnet susan bones lee jordan parvati and padma patil lavender brown anthony goldstein fred george ginny and ron weasley hermione granger and harry potter all smiled reminiscently at this she ginny was also amazed that nearly all of the members of the da had turned up for the upcoming battle ginny sighed dumbledore army it was a name from a lifetime ago it was a name that brought confidence to those who knew who dumbledore was and brought a strange feeling of pride to those who did not it was a name that ginny herself had once thought of and as harry turned and looked straight at her she smiled and nodded solemnly it was a name that was perfect for the situation a crusade to take back what was theirs the general barked orders to his men and dumbledore army marched to hogwarts it could be seen still in the darkness as dumbledore army approached and surrounded hogwarts the wizards chanted the muggles could now see the school in all its glory with a dark mark hanging like a poisonous cloud above the sun had started to rise the army stopped yet again everything was silent besides for the engines of the vehicles men planes tanks trolls dementors giants all alike halted death eaters had already stood positioned at windows and at the front door it was a solemn moment white light filled the skies harry potter walked up to the front of the ranks all eyes were on the boy who lived again twilight shone upon hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry history would be made fortuna meowed on harry shoulder through the darkness of it all a fire lit within the soul of harry potter he was home hogwarts time to take it back on the opposite side of hogwarts a ginger colored mysticat returned his meow it was a sign a symbol of unity within dumbledore army and then one word spoken in a deadly voice started it all attack twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty two turning the tide the turning point of a battle is when one soldier decides that he will not give up excerpt from soldier attack harry had said the word echoed through the hollowed halls like a foghorn it was the call of war and so the battle began jets zipped through the air shooting flurries of bullets from machine guns nailing many of the death eaters positioned at windows giants headed the ground assault along with tanks bashing a massive hole where the front doors used to be most of the wizards had started dueling with the death eaters that poured out of the blasted hole the elite team of old students consisting of harry hermione ginny ron luna and neville snuck through a side entrance their mission was to hit the death eaters at the front doors from the back hopefully breaking through the ranks allowing muggle infantry and wizard forces to enter they could only send six of them as any more would attract attention harry led the little team of six turning his head slightly to look down a corridor summune invisibility cloak he whispered the silvery cloak appeared in his hand ron and ginny first teleport the cloak back when you get to that pillar there when we are all there two of us keep the cloak on during the attack ron and ginny nodded and swinging the cloak over them disappeared harry saw them reappear a minute later behind a big steel pillar just ten meters away from the death eaters piled at the front doors all of a sudden the invisibility cloak flew to his hands again nev luna you guys next whispered hermione taking the cloak from harry hands and tossing it to neville harry i have something i need to tell you cantit wait hermione the invisibility cloak once again found itself in harry hands something changing in me whispered hermione as harry swung the invisibility cloak over them her eyes no longer looked confident but scared tears welling up in her eyes what is it the veela changes i think so i when this battle started a strange a feeling went through me it was like something prying to get out what are you trying to say out of the corner of his eye he saw ginny waving urgently in the direction he and hermione were i think i was about to become the monster side of a veela she whispered choking out the word monster he turned and stared at hermione whose bright eyes were shining pleading with him to not be disgusted he wasn t we ll talk about this later hermione dontworry i dontthink any less of you because of it after all the bad has got to come with the good doesntit and there a lot of good to balance out there he said winking at her she smiled and huddling closer together they started off to ron ginny luna and neville as they arrived harry whipped off the cloak and handed it to ron and ginny harry started hermione five pairs of eyes snapped to her thanks anytime the other four looked baffled ron shooting a suspicious glance at harry let go said harry on the count of three suggested ron sweeping the cloak over himself and ginny one started harry two added ginny from under the cloak three they all shouted and burst out behind the pillar trixtonia bellowed harry getting out the first curse sending ten death eaters flying out of the front doors straight into a barrage of bullets the death eaters now started to turn their attention to both sides the wizards caught between crossfire neville and luna proved to have much more grit than harry could remember disarming and stunning more death eaters than an average adult wizard could ve managed ginny and ron must ve looked pretty strange to the death eaters an orange net shooting out of midair to deflect their curses and many of them were now falling prey to the invisible brother and sister neville and luna eventually got separated from harry and hermione in the midst of the fray being driven back outside but harry saw a chance trixtonia he cried again this time blasting a hole big enough in the ranks of the death eaters the wizards and muggles alike with a savage war cry ran for the front doors firing their guns and spells at whatever stood in their way harry and hermione only barely avoiding some shots one stunning spell would ve smacked hermione straight in the chest had it not been for fortuna who had jumped from harry to hermione and deflected the light with a meow harry saw the thousands of corpses littered outside they had succeeded in their mission but whether it was fast enough he didntknow the hogwarts doors were breached the resistance now entered hogwarts with the air squadron outside prepared to gun down anyone trying to escape go go go shouted a muggle captain and a battalion of soldiers headed off to the left side of hogwarts this way roared snape and mcgonagall leading another battalion of wizards to the right harry knew it was his signal follow me he shouted beckoning his squadron of troops and ran straight for the great hall there are times in life in which one was to be considerate of other people property and of consequences of your actions but now certainly wasntit maximus reducto he bellowed blasting the doors of the great hall wide open he sprinted into the death eater filled great hall a hundred or so wizards and a thousand muggles behind him voldemort was nowhere in sight but there was about three hundred death eaters in the great hall firing off killing curses freely cutting holes into the ranks of harry troops what are you waiting for attack he cried exasperated running towards the fray he yelled multiplicus serpensortia this time was the most he had ever managed about fifty snakes exploded out of his wand slithering kill the death eaters protego he cried as a jet of white light flew towards him again he found himself without his watch nor fortuna who had perched on hermione shoulders on harry intentions apparently fortuna could now somewhat read harry mind skeledestructo totalus he shouted at a particularly large death eater and just paused a second to watch the man crumple his bones ground into dust out of the people that were doing the most damage it was clear that it was hermione and not harry although harry made his shots count it could not be clearer the dangerous side of hermione veela blood was kicking in and doing a lot a lot of damage harry watched fascinated almost horrified her eyes were starting to glow a dangerous purple and her fingernails had extended to long talons her hair rippled as if she was standing next to a strong wind apparently hermione was unaware of what she was doing as she sent a barrage of curses at the death eaters with one hand throwing veela fireballs that harry had seen during his fourth year with another her face was sheer battle fury hermione was practically invincible at this point fortuna blocking all of the spells that anyone aimed at her and her spells and fireballs scalding anyone that dared come near should a person have told him back in his first year that hermione granger would become a part veela that could fight like none harry had seen before he would ve told the person that they d had a bit too much to drink or else they knew a different hermione granger his time for contemplating fell short however when a killing curse zipped dangerously close to him whipping around he yelled flipendo the attacker flew upwards into a chandelier coming crashing down dead harry now ran to ginny and ron aid as a few death eaters were cornering them expelliarmus he cried a wand flew into the air diffindo the wand split splinters littering the floor the death eater turned around and stared at harry not smart skeledestructo he yelled aiming for the man torso it hit him straight on the man collapsing thanks mate ron said before turning his back and stunning a death eater that was approaching him harry nodded and now ran for hermione no person should stand alone in a battle harry had learnt long ago if one got hurt no one would know where you were hermione didntlook like one that would be hurt rather one that would be hurting other people she was surrounded by five wizards but the five were the ones that looked worried she was still in a fury harry could almost feel emotion radiate from hermione like light and heat from the sun harry came over and relieved some of her burdens trixtonia he roared the shockwave spell was becoming to be his specialty he could now hit specific targets easily blasting them further than the flipendo spell and temporarily deafening them three of hermione attackers were blasted into the wall where they fell unconscious harry saw hermione pocket her wand and throw two fireballs at each remaining attacker hitting them both in the stomach the death eaters let out a cry and burnt to his fiery death his flesh being roasted alive hermione in her victory started to lose some of the sharpness in her face although her eyes were still alight and her fingernails long and golden like a bird talons all right there my favorite sister harry yelled towards her whilst dodging a stunning spell cast at him all right my favorite brother she grinned back at him still apparently unaware of the changes that had taken her a n for those of you who dontlike how i just did that tough i going to anyway within a few more minutes the death eaters still standing were forced into a corner harry smirked it was his turn to try out the line he had heard so many times drop your wands and put your hands in the air or else you all die right here right now he growled menacingly they dropped their wands accio wands he heard ginny shout multiplicus diffindo ron said afterwards the wands snapped serpensortia prisone harry said the wizards now had snakes surrounding them choking them tying them the spell dumbledore had taught harry was useful indeed only he could free them stupefy many wizards then shouted stunning the prisoners take em down to the dungeons you and your men corporal said harry briskly and walked out of the great hall his five friends behind him but i not a corporal said the befuddled muggle as he watched the boy who lived walk out of the magical corpse strewn great hall lord voldemort was in a rage as he dueled with countless wizards killing them all his worthless death eaters had been defeated all over by mere muggles and a small fraction of wizards he let out a roar of rage he knew that there was no point in holding hogwarts if he was to be the only man left he sighed as he knocked kingsley shacklebolt flying through a window and out of hogwarts to fall to his death should he not have been killed on impact with the glass grabbing a nearby death eater he pressed his finger on the dark mark retreat he hissed he grabbed the snake amulet around his neck and blasting about twenty more wizards with a single wave of his wand he portkeyed away it was best to keep some men alive to live and fight another day after all what good was immortality when there was no one that was impressed and to serve you faithfully for it not much good at all the day had passed so very quickly tanks shattering walls and rolling into the castle blasting apart some of the stone walls made centuries ago slowly but surely dumbledore army started to crush voldemort forces it was not without cost as many were killed throughout the day hogwarts would never be the same again nine hours after the victory at the great hall at five o clock in the afternoon after fighting a series of exhausting attacks around the school harry had found himself moving up to astronomy tower just in time to see kingsley shacklebolt one of the many wizards there be blasted through a window and out into the skies snape jumped forward to take over kingsley duel with voldemort but the next thing harry knew there was a big explosion and voldemort disappeared and a ring of wizards around him were scattered around the floor dead many of the other death eaters had also disappeared but harry with a yell of flipendo sent one death eater flying into a wall in which he stunned right away harry was frustrated he arrived just too late voldemort got away again and as long as he still ran free the war wasntover now however wasnta time to think as the three cornered death eaters were in a frenzy unable to escape desperate they were being cornered by snape orion and moody slowly but surely losing when all of a sudden a jet of light smacked orion straight across the chest and she flew backwards before landing at harry feet dead harry ran forward to take her place ginny at his heels no stay back he roared the death eaters were desperate hurling as many curses as they could towards them flipendo yelled harry smacking a death eater straight against the wall where his skull crushed with a sickening crunch another death eater shot an enormous jet of light at harry he jumped out of the way nimbly just as he was about to hurl a stunning spell at the death eater he heard a cry of pain behind him harry whipped around when he saw who was hit he let out a roar of anguish laying in front of him chest impaled with a massive quivering arrow blood splattering everywhere was ginny weasley ginny he cried sprinting for her ron and hermione a few seconds behind him ginny eyes were closed her body trembling furiously pull it out he cried hermione with a wave of her wand sent the arrow zooming out of ginny chest she snapped awake with a scream ginny hold on we ll get you out of here we ll take you to a safe place you ll be alright said harry tears welling up in his eyes at the sight of ginny suffering a small choked sob from ginny told him it was an affirmative he pulled her bleeding form into his arms and sprinted with inhuman speed ron and hermione tailing him down the steep staircase leaving moody and snape to deal with the two kamikaze death eaters no no this cantbe happening stuttered harry tears now blurring his vision as ginny groaned in his arms so fragile so innocent she cantdie please dontlet her die it hurts harry said ginny in a pitiful small voice a solitary tear fell on ginny lips as she said this harry angrily wiping away the rest of his tears increased his pace you ll be okay ginny i promise as harry sprinted with superhuman speed down the corridor he searched desperately for the hole with the letters mwpp scratched around it i solemnly swear that i am up to no good he screamed at the hole whipping his wand inside he had stuck his wand inside with such a force that it almost snapped an event that harry would ve regretted enormously had it actually taken place however he was in a fever practically bouncing up and down clutching ginny in his arms like a priceless jewel or a newborn baby she was getting weaker and paler by the second a stunning spell whizzed past harry he didnteven notice it opened ever so slowly every second seeming like an eternity every second could be a second that ginny would stop holding out every second a year of torture to harry as ginny bled in his arms she shivered and harry tightened his grip around her a hand closing over her wound to prevent more blood loss diving through the hole cradling ginny in his arms he sprinted for the fireplace and softly lay her down on the sofa hermione heal her he cried tears now filling to the brim of his eye as he watched ginny breathe slowly sniffing and letting out sobs in front of him hermione quickly ran at ginny pushing harry out of the way impatiently and waved her wand starting to chant various spells harry she dying blood loss no charms to we have to no time to make a potion she needs harry took just a second to contemplate and understand this take mine he said in a hollow voice as much as she needs and mine said ron stepping up offering his arm as if blood was going to be pouring out of it any second all on its own no mine said hermione harry almost snapped at her then but stopped as hermione opened her mouth again veela blood restorative properties warmth what she needs now with that hermione with a wave of her wand cut open a large slit in her palm where blood started squirting out like a fountain grimacing with the pain she moved her palm down to ginny wound and slowly transferred the blood from her to ginny harry ron go help snape and moody they might go hollered hermione they didntmove go they need help said hermione a steely glint in her eye i not leaving said harry when ron had already ran out after kissing hermione on the cheek and hugging ginny and pecking her on the head you are the freaking boy who lived they need you out there go harry time and time again people had pecked at his responsibility in order to get him to do something i dontwant to be the boy who lived what good is it when i canteven stay when my own girlfriend and my best friend are lying there bleeding suffering hermione stopped for a second and raised her eyes slowly to harry s cool amethyst met fiery emerald suddenly he found himself floating into a web of happiness a harmonious tune playing softly in the background his mind emptying all he knew was he had to walk outside and go and help snape and moody or else terrible terrible things would happen he found his feet carrying him out of the marauder room he had gotten halfway up to the astronomy tower when he realized what hermione just did dratted veela powers fuming harry sprinted up the astronomy tower best get it all over with the sight that greeted him wasntthe one he expected slumped in the corner were moody and snape and the death eaters were the ones towering above them damn paristran magica he roared the spell smacked straight into a death eater and he felt an awesome surge of power that left the last death eater there he stared into the man eyes it was none other than macnair the scum that had tried to kill buckbeak he grinned foolishly harry didnthave time for this little nonsense rage flared through him that he had never known before the bastard shot ginny he walked closer the idiot still smiled and turned to him raising his wand harry his eyes still alight did not notice a huge torrent of wind erupt around him as he glared macnair in the eye fury radiating from every cell within him the smile disappeared turning into a horrified expression yes you should be scared ssss st stupefy stuttered macnair the red jet of light disappeared engulfed by the whirlwind spinning furiously around harry he didntwant to play around anymore this bastard shot ginny avada kedavra he roared the jet of bright green light hit macnair in the stomach harry watched in slow motion as macnair let out a deep roar as it hit and harry watched as his body still clinging on to life arch backwards cold eyes stared upon harry as he hurtled towards the stone walls the last thing macnair saw was the fury in harry potter green eyes his spirit which was already leaving his body shook like mad macnair smashed into a windowpane ripping out its iron foundations as he flew straight out of the window no one in the castle saw him fall but many people heard it macnair had been blasted all the way to the forbidden forest and as he fell he landed neck first onto a sharp boulder the sickening crack as the thin bones connecting his skull to his torso snapped anyone who heard it and knew what was the cause of it would remember they would remember that no one messes with harry potter girl around hogwarts the battle was ending the muggle soldiers rounding up the last of the death eaters that had not managed to escape or death eaters that refused to corpses littered the halls stained the floor and walls the majority of the muggle soldiers and almost half of the wizards and giants had fallen in this long battle tanks lay burning in the grounds and several jets had nosedived to the floor going up in flames but they were successful the death eaters had nearly been cleansed only about a hundred of them escaping all the dementors and trolls had been vanquished or killed in this battle tanks had blasted away much of the grounds and parts of the castle fighter jets had strewn corpses all over the hogwarts grounds which was blood drenched but at the long battle end they were successful they took back the symbol of hope in the wizarding world hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the once heralded as untouchable the pride and joy of centuries of headmasters great wizards and witches it was also lord voldemort strongest fortress and it had been felled a large horn blew in the distance signaling the end of the war and also as a tribute to those that died bravely in the noble fight harry potter ron weasley hermione granger and ginny weasley the two girls supported by harry and ron who had escaped practically unscathed besides for a few cuts and bruises stood at the top of astronomy tower they surveyed the grounds hogwarts was theirs again but at a great cost indeed tears of joy and of grief came out of everyone eyes but harry potter s in their eyes the war had now turned to their favor in essence it had but the still the main obstacle lay ahead lord voldemort still lived at the top of the tower harry potter trembled slightly he felt the anger and hatred radiate from lord voldemort he snorted aloud the hatred was mutual powers from both sides both so strong so proud and they both knew that at the end only one would stand your move riddle twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty four united we stand what in the name of merlin are you guys doing here asked a very confused ron weasley at the sight of neville and luna in the great hall word was that neville had been taken into luna family by her father they were quite rich and neville grandmother had been abducted by the death eaters in one of the earlier campaigns leaving him with either a choice to leave the country and go to america with his refugee relatives or else stay in london with luna he chose to stay with luna helping her father with writing articles for the quibbler which had now served to supply the wizarding population with laughs and rumors entertainment was much needed in times of war and suffering however on this day neville luna and luna father were both standing outside the great hall with snape and mcgonagall the house its flooded said luna sadly her father patted her on the shore consolingly harry noticed that all three of them were soaking wet neville shuddering with the cold what going on here neville luna what are you doing here hermione had just come down the stairs with ginny smiling warmly at neville and luna we re here because the house has been flooded repeated luna granger weasley weasley go in and have your breakfast potter come with us we have something to show you harry with a meaningful glance at ron left with snape potter a letter arrived for you this morning apparently it is not jinxed as professors flitwick mcgonagall moody and myself have tested it for any spells it seems perfectly safe besides for its peculiar packaging would you like to open it err i suppose so said harry cautiously it is in professor mcgonagall office you may go there now yourself the password is animagus as i sure you know inform myself or any other professor if there is any useful information yes professor said harry and walked by himself to mcgonagall office on the way he saw peeves glide around sullenly silent and inactive for once harry supposed that peeves must ve suffered during voldemort reign at hogwarts he had been like this for a long time now shaking his head he said animagus at the gargoyle and walked into mcgonagall office on mcgonagall desk was a black letter with gold rimming around it he cautiously moved his hand to open it relieved that nothing had happened harry took out an old yellowed piece of parchment out of the envelope potter at the summit lies the cure come get it if you dare the letter burst into flames right in front of harry eyes harry frantic to write down what he had just seen grabbed a piece of parchment lying on mcgonagall desk and a quill and copied down the short message on the parchment he knew this was no childish prank this was serious so do you know what this means asked harry mcgonagall snape and moody raised a hand to quiet him harry was growing exasperated for the last half an hour the three adults had been staring at the parchment and debating in hushed whispers i believe potter this was from lord voldemort himself harry sighed well that much was obvious quiet potter ten points from hogwarts isntrunning right now severus reminded mcgonagall yes yes okay now this part of the message is intriguing at the summit lies the cure hermione who had been sitting with ron and ginny whilst harry paced furiously around the room spoke up i think its to do with the plague she said thoughtfully but where is this summit the summit i thought i d never hear that phrase again after albus well the summit is the last earthly link to the pandemonium citadel what the pandemonium citadel then hold on hold on i getting there now where was i the pandemonium citadel cried harry and ron right the pandemonium citadel is a surreal place linking our realm to the mysteries of the unexplored or as the muggles call it heaven or hell where is it no one knows for certain rumors are that it lies at the peak of atlantis codswallop said moody mcgonagall gave him an icy stare i ve been there myself it in the himalayas and you know this because didnti just tell you i ve been there myself no mortal has you re lookin at one right now enough came snape voice i believe we have the message now lord voldemort is obviously trying to lure potter to the summit and using the cure for the plague as bait the question is what do we do wondered hermione we asked harry whipping around to face hermione of course we what are you thinking that you re going to go yourself no one going until we find out if this is a trap or not of course it a trap cried harry then you dontgo said snape and started to go out of the room no snape turned around we have no choice within weeks the muggle borns and the muggles will all be dead hermione couldnthelp but make a slight offended noise at that listen here potter you re going to risk your life on voldemort word harry sighed resigned at the six pairs of eyes glaring at him i suppose not but the wheels and cogs in harry brain had already started working by the cover of the night he d leave any way to stop the plague he would gladly take dobby can you help me harry potter sir harry potter dobby was fearing that you would not come back but you has cried the house elf and immediately cannon balled into harry stomach dobby this is urgent i need a spellbook which has information on how to conjure food certainly harry potter sir i is being right back the summit is a mysterious place little known to wizard kind it is rumored to be the sole gateway to the pandemonium citadel a place heard of only in the great tales of old a surreal place where spirits pass through on their journey in the afterlife what is known of the summit is that it is of incredible danger both natural and magical hazards from the diary of general reneziger of norway in the demon extermination campaigns written in 239 b c there are creatures which are said to have come from another dimension lying at the summit and it is said that the sun never shines there an adventurer by the name of trevent was the last recorded person to have reached the summit although he had gone insane four days after returning no one has come back alive since harry shut the book it was almost midnight harry had secretly prepared everything he would need for his journey to the summit drawing information out of moody reading about the herbs that grew in the himalayas grabbing his firebolt the cookbook from dobby the invisibility cloak his wand fortuna magically shrunk and lightened food that would last him at least two weeks the cookbook was just a precaution and traveling cloaks and a thick black cape for protection against the cold should the warming charms not be appropriate for use at some stage for example a frozen pond harry knew nothing about the summit besides for that the co ordinates the fact that it was very cold and that there were many dangers along the way he looked out into the moonlight he saw the quidditch field illuminated by the pale moonlight he saw the stillness of the forbidden forest he saw the warm flickering lights from within hagrid hut he turned away it may well be the last time he would ever see these things he thought to himself he sighed now he would have to do what he dreaded most he turned and looked at ron i sorry mate he whispered i hope that you ll live a happy life with hermione whether i come back or not his touching words were ignored by a snoring ron who had tossed in his sleep and murmured no donttouch the cinnamon firecrackers ron junior seven sickles apiece buy your weasley wizarding wheezes no hermione house elves dontlike toilet brushes harry couldnthelp but smile at that with one last glance at the tall gangly redhead he took his baggage with him and gently closed the head boy dorm door dropping his things on the couch upon entering the common room where the fire was still burning merrily he walked up to hermione and ginny room gently sliding open the door he walked in had it been under any other circumstance harry would ve felt very awkward about it he walked to hermione bedside first sis he whispered i want you to be happy also hermione thank you for everything you ve done for me i going to try and pay you back memories flooded his mind the numb feeling he had gotten when he heard that hermione had been petrified back in his second year the fright that she had been dead earlier this year when they were at riddle mansion the worry he had felt when malfoy bewitched her he kissed hermione sleeping form on the forehead and slowly turned to ginny he stood for ten solid minutes staring at her sleeping form moonlight shining on her illuminating her hair and face ginny he choked out harry couldntthink of any words in which to express his innermost feelings as he watched ginny turn over in her sleep all the small things he thought things like this that what i fighting for and that why i must go he whispered aloud turning to leave he allowed himself one last glimpse at ginny he soaked in her peaceful image lying in her bed deep in sleep he walked over and planted a small kiss on her cheek for the road goodbye ginny he said ginny twisted violently in her sleep harry watched for another minute before gathering the resolve to leave as he walked down out of the girl dorm and to the portrait hole carrying a rucksack his firebolt on his shoulder fortuna jumped onto his shoulder are you ready fortuna we re going now say goodbye to it all said harry stroking fortuna fortuna purred smiling harry turned to the fireplace when a voice made him jump a meter into the air and where do you think you re going harry damn it was ron the boy sure did have a thing for interrupting harry in the middle of something important whether it be a passionate kiss or this an escape from hogwarts to try and save the world of muggles and muggle born he must ve gotten up to get a cup of water or something ron i have to go no harry you dontknow anything about you cantjust hermione he hollered now harry was in trouble i never should have said goodbye seconds later hermione came sleepily followed by ginny down the staircase s matter ron he tried to leave leave quidditch mumbled ginny sleepily no dontyou remember the letter exclaimed ron ginny seemed to all of a sudden snap awake i knew it she cried i knew you were going to go but even you arentthat stupid to leave without preparing anything are you i have prepared things said harry slightly annoyed that ginny dismissed his entire day of hard work oh yeah said ron stepping in yeah so what is at the top of the summit he asked raising an eyebrow harry was struck dumb he didntdo any research on what he would actually find in the summit just how to get there however he wasntgoing to let ron outwit him dementors he said saying the first thing in his head damn i wish i knew if that was right harry laughed despite having three angry stares on him we re coming with you harry sighed this was what he had been dreading no you don t understand ron almost yelled we understand you better than you understand yourself this is a trap ron and we re going to get trapped with you if your damn stubbornness makes you walk knowingly into one ron he not the only one said hermione standing next to ron harry we ve been with you the entire way we ll be with you till the end harry resolve was slowly weakening tears threatening to form as he watched his two best friends staring him resolutely in the eye what have i done to deserve such friends no one not one person has come back alive for a century and then ginny spoke up if you dontlet us we ll follow you we ll follow your tracks like dogs on a hunt you either let us come willingly with you or you make us chase you as harry lifted his eyes to ginny s he knew he had made a mistake more than any veela magic could ever do the determination in her eyes melted the last of the resolve he had when he spoke it was in a dry croak all right okay give us a few minutes to pack what we need hermione ron ginny we need to go to diagon alley you guys will need supplies yes of course said hermione thoughtfully getting up and going to the staircase please harry let do some more research before no hermione every day thousands of people get infected with the plague if the cure really is at the summit the sooner we go the sooner the plague is stopped but we dontknow what there that why we bring every last gadget we can think of said harry waving at his bag hermione stomped up the staircase ignoring harry last comment ginny was at her heels ron had already disappeared back up the boys staircase harry slumped down on the couch defeated he never wanted to drag anyone with him through his adventures they always seemed to want to come along harry didntknow what would happen if one of them got hurt or even worse died people said he was the hero how wrong they were it was his friends always his friends that were the ones who stuck through it through thick and thin they were the ones who helped him through everything they were ones that kept him sane it wasnthim that was the hero he thought dimly observing ron coming down the staircase it was them ron what had i done to deserve such friends he thought again yeah thanks for what nothing nothing at all thought harry everything a small girl of eleven tossed and turned in her bed she had been dreaming of a big wedding of feasts and ceremonies of music and joy when an unbidden shadow penetrated her mind she saw flashes of images a lion roaring snakes flying screams unearthly screams and a pair of bright green eyes she mumbled in her sleep at the summit the end will come no one was there to hear it and the new prophecy was lost it was around three in the morning when harry hermione ginny and ron finally set off okay we floo to diagon alley first to buy our supplies said harry grabbing a fistful of floo powder from the shelves and threw it into the flames green embers erupted diagon alley he said and carrying his rucksack broom and fortuna he whirled in the fireplace tumbling out at the other end he never would like traveling by floo powder ginny appeared a few seconds after him followed closely by ron and hermione c mon quality quidditch supplies first we need to buy you three the best brooms there are we could very well need them ten minutes later harry gringotts account was a whole lot emptier as hermione ron and ginny came out clutching brand new firebolts ron stammering his thanks in an incoherent ramble of words next we go to the dark market err harry yes dark market yes what we need next we re not going to find in diagon alley what do we need next an invisibility cloak oh that not going to come cheap murmured ginny i ll manage said harry and led them down to knockturn alley pull your hoods up we dontwant to be recognized even in the early hours before sunrise the market was bustling harry walked up to a frightening vampire and growled in a deep voice do you know where the invisibility cloaks dealers are the vampire stared at him for a second and hissed there only one cloak dealer and you re looking right at him now how much for an invisibility cloak state your price i looking for a fair lot of money on this one ten thousand sounds about right to me ten thousand yelped ron ginny kicked him taken said harry handing over a bank note the vampire waved his hand and a massive wardrobe appeared in front of their faces he grabbed a silvery one near the end and tossed it at harry take it and be gone he said and with another wave of his hand the wardrobe disappeared harry tried it on work he asked yeah let go good doing business with you he added to the vampire who turned away what now whispered hermione after they had left knockturn alley now we go said harry put a finger on the portkey said harry taking out a chocolate frog portus he said the frog glowed blue for a second and then stood stationary the four of them placed a finger on the frog and with an incantation of activatio they whizzed away from diagon alley and to the bitter cold of the himalayas the four arrived shivering flinging on their cloaks they looked to the mountains it looked like a difficult trek indeed even on broomstick snow covered the paths jagged rocks blocking the views the summit could not be seen as moody had warned harry they would have to continue the majority of the journey on broomstick and the final stretch on foot clouds gathered overhead and thunder roared we better get going said harry and mounted his firebolt the four teenagers flew forwards no one noticed the maniacal eyes burning holes through their backs no one noticed a lone shadow follow twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty five hope at hogwarts the order was assembled the disappearance of harry potter and his friends caused an enormous uproar we have to follow them no what do you mean no if we leave hogwarts might be attacked but potter the prophecy he is ready many have sacrificed to buy him the time this last road none of us can help him on he has left our range how do you know this is the last road exclaimed mcgonagall because said moody no one leaves the summit it d take a miracle and potter better well provide one you left the summit started someone but was abruptly cut off by mcgonagall but what do we do in the mean time surely he who must not be named wontattack hogwarts if this is all a trap for potter moody paused sliding his hand over his scarred face deep in thought snape stood strike them from behind trap the trappers wontyou know who be prepared for that asked tonks frowning a silence followed this statement yes he will said snape but we ve got advantage in numbers we cannot hope to gather any of the muggle support with the plague about i doubt any dare go to the core of it all you fool diggle snarled snape dontyou understand potter gone off on his own little solo journey leaving us in a very nasty position we donthave a choice and why not have you not been listening for the past two years shrieked mcgonagall all of a sudden the prophecy how do we know that it not a trap for us not for potter we don t but think about it logically diggle what is more important to lord voldemort removing the only threat that could harm him or attacking an empty fortress the man named diggle bowed down low and took his seat all in favor of going to potter aid whether by catching up to them or by diverting you know who forces asked mcgonagall almost all hands were raised mad eye you do know how to get there dontyou asked tonks yawning widely several people glared at her moody sighed yes he said but i dontever want to go there again the old auror shuddered much to the surprise of the whole room a deep sense of foreboding took them all no one spoke i afraid you ll have to said snape heavily at last as you said this is the last road harry swung his broomstick on his shoulder and continued on foot they had come to a tunnel in the mountains too dark to fly lumos the four of them said the pale beams of light shone a path in the darkness it was the afternoon after they had first set off on their trek to the summit harry did not think it would have been as difficult as moody had described it as there were jagged rocks along the mountainside the rain which had started to pour around mid day pounded had pounded on the four of them whilst they sped up the mountain on their firebolts soon the rain had turned to snow and then to hail which poured down at such a speed that cuts covered all four of their bodies fortuna the only unscathed as the mysticat had been sleeping in harry rucksack harry felt ginny shiver slightly next to him in the darkness here he said handing her a thick overcoat he had bought thanks harry she said quietly an uncomfortable silence took the four friends after that the feeling of impending danger was upon them harry knew only too well that they were very lucky indeed that none of the hideous creatures moody had told him about had appeared yet harry pointed his wand at the walls seeing the sight he grimaced the walls were stained red what looked horribly like remnants of torn apart human skeletons littered the floors beside them no one spoke still although all of them had seen it turning his wand away from the walls and towards the slippery mountain path harry continued onwards all of a sudden his scar flared with pain and clutching his head he slipped on the floor hitting his head hard on the icy floor harry cried ginny ron and hermione voices three beams of light shone on him it was voldemort he gasped rubbing his head blood covered his fingers harry didntknow what compelled him to say his next words but as soon as he said it he knew it was true just like how he could sense voldemort mood he knows we re here how many are we three hundred and twelve professor snape sir how many are muggles the errand boy stopped and frowned none very well please inform the supplies division of the numbers so they can hand out equipment yes sir cried the boy and sprinted off severus snape was busy making a rough map with mad eye moody out of the rough sketches snape had right now it did not look like an easy trail it was like a labyrinth twists and turns in the path where one could get lost and wind up in a place far far away from the mountains moody also warned of creatures and ancient enchantments placed on the road to the summit it looked like a dark journey indeed mad eye call together everyone we have now we will go over the plans and all that are fit to leave shall leave snape swept out of the room grim faced leaving an equally foreboding mad eye moody standing in the room himself he hobbled away shaking his head okay let make camp said harry motioning to a dry patch of ground under a small cliff they had barely got out of the tunnel by midnight and they were hungry cold and tired where do we sleep asked ron with a frown why in the leaky cauldron let just pop down there now why dontwe said hermione sarcastically who was in a bad mood from the cold and the long march through the tunnel oh great said ron before realizing the bitter sarcasm in her voice idiot muttered ginny also in a foul mood summune tent said harry and before them a big squashy looking lime green tent appeared i daresay this ll be good enough said harry walking into the tent first it wasntanything close to the magical tents mr weasley had got when they visited the quidditch world cup it was a one roomed tent with four sleeping bags and a small table this reminds me of something said hermione thoughtfully surveying the surroundings her eyes sparkling this is remus tent said harry quietly three pairs of eyes shot towards him he gave it to me last year another silence took the four as they wordlessly took out the prepared food they had brought hermione muttered a quick charm to heat the food and sitting at the small table they started on an uneasy dinner now that they were warmed up and had food in front of them the mood took an upturn hermione and ginny were laughing about something and ron was licking his lips diving into his plate of food mmm said ron munching on his fish and chips harry would ve laughed as ron discreetly took a piece of fish from hermione plate as she looked the other direction had it not been so serious of a situation hey ginny can i have some said ron holding a fork in one hand and a piece of fish in the other ginny shot ron a slightly disgusted glance and nodded fanks ginny said ron beaming and spitting out a piece of fish onto the table as they finished their meager meals harry motioned to the sleeping bags you three sleep first i ll take lookout duty lookout duty asked ginny we re not in a safe place anymore said hermione nodding to harry you re not planning on running off and stranding us here are you harry gave her a penetrating stare in response to his consternation she giggled you know i never would ve thought that i d be at the legendary harry potter side walking knowingly into a trap harry eyes were sad as he looked at hermione strangely her face held no blame rather admiration for reasons unknown i never would ve thought i d turn out to be a veela a hero even finished hermione a dreamy look on her face although hermione smiled at this harry felt such a strong feeling of guilt that he never experienced before i sorry he whispered downcast i sorry i dragged you all into this he didntdeserve them he thought again oh harry sighed hermione and ginny both sitting down next to him and wrapping their arms around him in a sisterly fashion hey what about me said ron who was still munching on the remnants of ginny dinner he burped then smiled eww the girls said and scampered away from ron jokingly harry couldnthelp but smile even in times like this going on what was most possibly the most dangerous journey anyone has taken for years his friends could still joke and have fun he turned his sight to hermione and ginny ginny was still busy giggling but he could ve sworn hermione caught his eye and winked smiling indeed his friends were extraordinary we re ready excellent said snape a grim smile on his face mad eye the auror nodded everyone portkey out neville grabbed the copy of hogwarts a history shooting a glance at luna who stood resolutely next to him holding a potato multiplicus activatio shouted snape and neville found himself being whizzed away from the warmth of the hogwarts halls where he had been sweating like mad just a few seconds ago and into the bitter freezing cold of the himalayas immediately he regretted his rash decision to join the party to find harry if he and ron hermione and ginny were still alive that was however seeing the grim determined faces of his friends and professors he found courage he had never known existed before seldom tapped into he looked around next to him was luna and seamus and around them were parvati lavender dean ernie cho chang and a couple of others that neville only knew by appearance despite having many meetings with them he couldntremember their names all were here to help save harry whilst the majority of the forces had been sent across the other side of the mountain led by snape and moody to try and smoke out voldemort death eaters neville raised his head towards the summit much like harry had done a few days ago we re coming harry he said solemnly luna snatched his hand her eyes also focused on the stormy top of the mountains let go said neville and so they went the core of the original dumbledore army off to find their general harry glanced outside through a small window in the magical tent the moon and stars shone bright outside he turned and surveyed his best friends sleeping peacefully in the sleeping bags on the floor it was three o clock in the morning his shift was over nonetheless as he saw ron snoring slightly a smile plastered onto his face he couldntbear to ruin whatever dream his best friend was having they were willingly coming into this with him the best he could do was at least let them get their rest yawning harry turned to fortuna who was stretching luxuriously over his invisibility cloak a bowl of milk in front of him all of a sudden fortuna meowed and hissed jumping to harry shoulder the feline eyes glowing blue what is it fortuna asked harry quietly knowing all well the cat couldntanswer he walked up to the window and looked outside you can stop looking i right here said a girlish voice he didntrecognize thinking extremely fast he whipped around and cried expelliarmus protego said the girl lazily his own jet of light flew back at him and he only barely dodged it as it hit his bag food began to fly out his yell had woken his friends up s matter mumbled ginny ron and hermione however were quickest to survey the scene in just a few short seconds grabbing their wands and turning towards the intruder expelliarmus shouted hermione and ron the girl once again raised her wand and flung the spells back towards their casters ron and hermione wands flew out of their hand but the girl in doing this took her eyes off harry for a second too long expelliarmus he cried again and this time the girl wand flew out of her hand much to his dismay however she whipped out another wand from her pocket and with a wave ginny wand joined ron and hermione in a neat stack on the table and harry found his wand being tugged very forcefully away from him must hang on he thought cantlet that death eater win serpensor serpensortia prisone he bellowed and suddenly found that his wand was in his full control again just on time he pointed it at the girl and screaming she was bound tightly by magical snakes however after she fell over apart from the initial shock she didntlook remotely scared at all you know they always said you were the best dueler harry laughing slightly to herself she muttered an incantation and the snakes released her dontmove he snarled aiming his wand right at the girl eyes now having time to see just who this intruder was he saw she looked rather like ginny only her eyes were ablaze with the fire of one who had suffered one that was searching for revenge she had red hair a slender curvy body she looked like she would ve been extremely attractive had she not had a nasty smirk plastered on her face who are you who sent you what are you doing here he asked first question first said the girl rolling her eyes not at all bothered by the four wands that were pointed at her cut the crap growled ron my name is hope weasley she said liar proclaimed ginny you re not a weasley i know all of our family members mum made us memorize it all ignoring ginny she continued no one sent me i ve come by myself all of a sudden she looked at ginny so you re aunt ginny she murmured to herself who the hell are you cried ron obviously itching to hurl a hex straight at the girl i told you dad i hope huh dad ron said scratching his nose looking rather insulted load of dung this is er hope was it said harry drawling in such an attitude it would ve made draco malfoy himself proud you know i dontthink i like you she said narrowing her eyes you re the one with four wands pointing at you i d keep my comments to myself if i were you multiplicus expelliarmus all four wands including harry flew out of their hands you d think you would ve known to watch out for a spell your own mother invented enough of this said the girl called hope just let me talk she said placing her wand down we re listening you re the one armed after all snarled harry i going to say this once and only once my name is hope virginia weasley eldest daughter of ronald and hermione weasley second head witch of the phoenix resistance but you dontknow about that well i am from the year 2020 and things arentgoing too well dung spat hermione we ve done time travel traveling in any means besides a time turner will open up a separate timeline and but you invented a new spell said the girl smiling slightly it was a sad smile much like one harry had found himself giving in times he d rather not think about you are insane ron had dived for his wand and turning to the girl yelled stupefy the girl caught at unawares fell unconscious onto the floor what the bloody hell is this yelled ron death eater said harry coldly looking upon the girl with distaste the girl i just realized something she didnttry to harm any of us just disarmed started ginny let see what she has to say said hermione fairly no hermione was shocked her mouth hanging half open in mid sentence at the hardness of harry voice we cantrisk it you donthave a choice said hope voice they whirled around and all started shouting incantations don t please i ll tell you why i here they stopped halfway through their spells the four friends glanced at each other their wands still trained on hope and after what seemed an age nodded to her say we are to believe you say you really are from the future said harry how do we know who you are who you claim to be the hair and freckles not enough said hope with a hint of a smile tugging on her lips harry however was dead serious show me who you are how like so grabbing her wand from her hands he turned it to her she didntmove how very trusting of her thought harry memoirtransverto a n now you didntreally think i was going to put all the brain to brain communication stuff in the story for no reason did you the girl reacted similarly to james and lily when he had used the same spell on them early in his seventh year when things had been so simple tears welled up in hope dark blue eyes harry shrugged day in the life of the boy who lived okay you want proof i ll give you some taking back her wand she did exactly the same as harry and with a cry of memoirtransverto harry found himself drowning in memories that did not belong to him a dinner table with eggs and ham mum and dad standing over me feeding me soup from a tin whilst i spat it out a boy pulling on my pigtails a picture of a black haired boy with a scar on his head a crazy woman mummy told me was my aunt my treehouse a scream of pain crimson eyes blood more blood mummy lifeless eyes staring back up at me daddy anguished howl more blood more death a high pitched echo of laughter a greasy haired man falling in a flash of green light a phoenix and a cat speeding across the lands chasing a snake run hope run those eyes again more blood and harry snapped back into his mind ten minutes later all of them knew that what hope was telling was the truth she took a deep breath and started telling them why she was here something bad happened today something that will change the course of history hope broke off rubbing her eyes what asked harry glancing into the girl tortured eyes she didntlift her head what asked harry again this time more forcefully you died she whispered in a strangled voice twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty six the work of hope weasley you died a chilly feeling took harry what he stuttered although he heard perfectly i sorry said hope looking sympathetic much to harry surprise he had thought the girl as a cold hearted sufferer of the second war it shocked him that she could be disposed to feel sympathetic to the one that had caused all her suffering a person she had never known but how he had thought about death before but the idea of it happening to him never quite struck home how could i die a flame sprite attacked this tent an hour before sunrise and burnt your wand into cinders and wounded you horribly you mum dad and auntie ginny couldntdefeat the sprite without you being armed and you four ran away from it towards the summit desperately when you reached the summit the sprite had caught up to you and so had voldemort band of death eaters you were trapped harry surveyed the girl eyes voldemort killed you when you dived to save auntie ginny but they were rescued by the order bursting through that all dad told me said hope and it was at the summit that almost all of the order perished he used legilimency to detect any trace of a lie as he looked into her eyes much to his dismay there was none are you going to change the future i going to change the past i here to help i know how to vanquish the flame sprite you wontdie today ginny looked slightly concerned but wontyour timeline be changed if harry doesn t die yes she said that exactly the point but you might not have been born cut in hermione that a sacrifice i ll have to make isntit but you dontwant to live in the world where i live in said hope solemnly you donteven know me why do you want to save me asked harry voicing his thoughts sybil trelawney prophecy was true only you can defeat lord voldemort but he immortal sighed harry i here to get the cure for the plague spreading in great britain here said hope taking out a vial of purple liquid it a kind of bacteria reversing the effects the of the black plague just pour it out into a warm place and it will multiply have one person drink it and walk around and before you know it everyone will be cured wouldntthat just spread another plague no the bacteria dies in a person after a month time although that was enough to save what was left of the muggle and muggle born population what was left of it squeaked hermione anxiously six hundred muggles that all that was left all their mouths fell open hope ignoring this continued but you saved them mu hermione you found the cure the girl broke into the first genuine smile harry had seen and he saw that it brightened up her eyes immensely so they shone almost a light purple color instead of the dark blue hermione eyes he thought looking from hermione to hope hope was a part veela too i i found how you were an inventor er hermione said hope awkwardly she seemed to find it difficult and awkward to call her elder generation by their first names whereas harry nearly laughed at the thought of ron cradling a baby in his arms it was funny how different generations of people had immensely different views he thought even at the same age they must ve really grown up an inventor what did i invent asked hermione now interested you ll find out said hope what was i asked ron with interest but hope had turned to harry we have two hours to prepare the flame sprite struck at five in the morning harry finally trusted the girl with all his heart any daughter of ron and hermione couldntbe bad tell us what we need to know cho was near the head of their little party with neville longbottom flying up the very same path harry had gone just a few days ago she saw smoke in the distance hurry she shouted pointing at the smoke high high above them putting all of the flying skills she had inhibited from years of being a seeker cho zoomed ahead of them all hail blowing in her fair face leaving deep cuts all over her body but she didntcare she saw her goal she saw behind her everyone following with the same determination as she turned around once more she found herself facing a jagged rock a door to a crack into the mountain there was no way for them to go up above it as hail poured down and a cliff blocked the brooms from going up she took out a map we re at the tunnels and climbing off her broomstick with an incantation of lumos cho walked in through the gap it should come about now said hope stepping outside and looking near the skies the last two hours or so were spent talking discussing their plans for the demon and after half an hour slightly forced casual conversation ron himself was still slightly wary of the girl despite her allowing him to see her memories he had gripped his wand tightly the whole time at the table much to harry concern as hope eyes darted occasionally to ron hand a sad expression on her face lingering for just seconds before her lazy smirk replaced it harry thought she must ve been thinking about the ron from her world from what she was saying a responsible well mannered man with morals ron had interrupted then saying morals schmorals no one had spoken for half a minute their mouths half open from talking then hope laughed and the three girls went on talking hermione and ginny however seemed to be most sympathetic with hope chatting amiably with her whilst harry and ron remained silent ron watchful and harry pensive i suggest you pack away your tent unless you like sleeping in ashes right said harry evanesco the tent disappeared the five started shivering slightly despite the cloaks they were wearing hope mmm replied hope still looking to the skies what happened to the world after we lost at the summit asked harry hope didntanswer please when you died your friends my parents and auntie fled from the summit with the order but lord voldemort after killing you had no more fears he came to hogwarts and destroyed the entire castle she stopped at that and sighed before continuing no one else could defeat him the last hope was gone now harry sighed ron ginny and hermione looked terrified lord voldemort won the second war what was left of the wizards that opposed him were fifty wizards six survivors from the order of the phoenix led them who dad i mean ron minister longbottom nymphadora tonks parvati patil myself and my cousin sammie what what happened to everyone else seeing the distressed look on the girl face harry said never mind i know but you see that why i ve come we cantlet that happen harry nodded solemnly all of a sudden hope whipped out her wand it coming harry all of a sudden felt an surge of heat blow through him like fire spreading in his very veins and then it appeared it was the flame sprite hope had spoken of an eight foot tall demon hovering in the air fearfully flames engulfed its body dark sharp looking horns on its skull and seven inch long claws on its hands its red eyes stared at them it was what harry had always imagined the devil looked like all of a sudden a massive boulder composed of what looked suspiciously like molten lava shot towards them rondache conjure shouted harry and hope two large round shields appearing out of thin air blocking the boulder and causing it to roll in a separate direction tumbling off the side of a mountain crashing against the snow filled ground below them smoke rose so thick that harry could barely see in front of him maximus reducto shouted ron and ginny how they managed to aim through the smoke harry did not know but the spells hit the sprite making it stumble slightly it roared a jet of fire escaping like an inferno as it did so torrentoria shouted hermione clouds appeared above the sprite pouring down torrents of water dampening the flames that lit the body of the sprite up it bellowed with pain and with a slash shattered harry shield he and ginny jumped behind hope s just as hope jumped out from behind the shield and charged forwards her eyes burning with veela fury a sphere of fire appeared in each of her hands this is for the uncle i never had shouted hope and flung the fireballs straight into the sprite stomach it roared once again but with the fire dampened it couldntsend out its blast of fire it started stomping towards hope this is for my aunt she shouted again and another two fireballs impaled the demon the demon lashed out against hope shredding her robes and leaving two gashes along her shoulder this is for the twins she roared and yet another two fireballs smashed into the sprite smashing it backwards a bit it jumped at hope smashing her on her legs ripping her robes completely so it was just mere strips of cloth covering her her knees bled impaled with sharp claws she didntflinch just shot a warning glance at harry not to run out before it was time this is for my dad she roared turning back to the demon two more fireballs engulfed the sprite which now staggered hope jumped towards the demon her eyes burning maniacally claws extending out of her fingers her face mutating rapidly and wings bursting out of her shoulder blades she was embracing all of the veela blood within her focusing her energy in a way hermione never learnt despite his numb excitement observing hope combat the sprite in the back of his mind he couldnthelp but be impressed with this girl from the future letting out a scream of pain two more fireballs appeared in her hands this is for my mum she bellowed and flung with what seemed like the last of her strength two final fireballs towards the staggering demon the final fireballs as they sunk into the flesh of the demon engulfed it with flames once more only this time it wasntin control of them the demon batted itself wildly shrieking with pain its flesh alight hope collapsed onto the floor the wings retracting the sharpness of her face disappearing this was their signal harry ron hermione and ginny ran out now from behind the shields and as they aimed their wands at the demon they felt a strong surge of power course through them the shield of the founders harry remembered hermione exact words on the day they found out what they had all along thought was the marauder shield truly was it a mystical shield which was said to be a myth found by the founders of hogwarts in a stash of merlin things it is said to be a bonding talisman a bonding talisman forms a strong connection between a certain number of wizards which magnifies their abilities as long as the four are in a reasonably close proximity to each other it appeared their particular bond needed such a situation which required teamwork from all of them to initiate the bond with quick glances at each other they roared as one vanquisho as the jets of white light flew out of their wands mixed as one and struck the sprite straight where hope fire had burnt a scalding figure eight shape it let out an otherworldly wail glowing so brightly harry had to squint to see the demon disappeared in a flash of white light harry let his wand arm relax and he turned to his friends hope he cried seeing the girl lying on the floor for right before his eyes the girl had a white light gathering in her chest as they spoke her face now had fully changed back now looking rather like a timid child than the fierce veela that had fought against the massive fire sprite hope what happening to you cried hermione running to her side ron and ginny right behind her but harry understood as she changed their future her own past was doomed the light began spreading across her body now covering her entire torso no stop it hope cried ron who now seemed to have taken a liking to the girl much in contrast to just merely minutes ago when they had been chatting what going on wailed ginny hope started harry the girl met his eyes and she smiled thank you you know what i think i do like you after all you re welcome she said hermione and ron turned to harry for just a second before turning back to hope her body was now completely covered in the light all that they could see were her glittering violet eyes bye mum bye dad said hope voice dreamily sounding rather detached i love you but hermione and ron as much as they liked the girl they just met just couldntsay it back goodbye hope said hermione solemnly bye hope we ll always remember you said ron not looking at the glowing body next to him but rather at the skies and with ron words hope weasley and all that she was all that she would be was gone her work was finished alastor mad eye moody stumped resentfully up the cold mountains hundreds of wizards behind him the weather he could bear the hardships of the road he could suffer but mad eye moody did not know what he would do should he run into another fire sprite those fearsome creatures moody feared above anything in the world and nothing not even the threat of the world itself collapsing could make him stare one in the eye much to his self loathing step by step seemed a labour to moody fear growing and growing with every meter closer to the summit and lo and behold the peak was in his sights halt here said moody take our meal break and tell everyone to pull themselves together in three hours we take the final stretch we better go said harry softly two days later upon sunrise ron hermione and ginny were still numb with shock about the peculiar girl that was their next generation having come and gone within hours saving their lives and the lives of millions of muggles they had spent two days sitting in the tent the first day out of plain dumb shock at the extraordinary events with the flame sprite the second day because of the torrents of wind that made it impossible to fly in harry by far suffered the least from hope abrupt entrance and departure his life had already been touched by too many woes he learnt to deal over time something that he hoped ron hermione and ginny would never have to get used to why said hermione slowly we have the antidote yeah agreed ron we know this is a trap why dontwe just go back to hogwarts truth be told harry didntknow why either just that there was a strange feeling pushing him forwards closer and closer to the stormy peak that was the summit this is it he said falling into a trance like state yet strangely aware of some things around him completely unaware of others he could almost hear each individual raindrop hit the mountain and slide down to the ground he could feel each rock that shifted as water batted against it weathering its rough surfaces what harry asked ginny who was puzzled still in shock but her words fell on deaf ears this is where it ends what are you talking about harry asked ron this is the last road harry shouted hermione as harry had already started walking up the path this is what they bought me time for hermione he said his voice soft but confident stop harry no ginny you dontunderstand the prophecy this is where it all ends he said how do you know cried hermione who had grabbed harry arms to make him stop he snapped out of his little trance i can feel it in my blood ron shuddered from behind harry no mate don t come back there will be another chance go back all three of you go back deliver the cure this is my path and mine alone shut up harry snapped around what i said shut up snarled ginny whose days of trekking in the harsh himalayan mountains built up her foul mood it was finally being let out puzzled harry looked to hermione and ron for support but found them staring back at him with the same expressions of anger what wrong with you asked harry with indignation what wrong with you retorted ginny waspishly look i dontknow that much is obvious snapped ginny hey i ve had enough of your you know what harry just shut up and start flying because if you re going we re not going anywhere but with you but but ginny had prodded him and he still not understanding jumped onto his broomstick and zipped up the path his friends close on his tail harry knew deep down in his heart this day was indeed the day it would all end it was just like how a baby could recognize it mother voice before even understanding what it meant it was like how a person could walk around in his or her own house in the pitch dark and know exactly what was where although they couldntsee it it was instinct and instinct told him that today was the day that all of the sacrifices people had made for him would either be in vain or be rewarded and the instinct told him the final fight was his own he didntknow why exactly he should trust the instinct just that he did gaining speed he left ginny ron and hermione behind they never were quite as good as him when it came to flying and now finally it paid off he thought as he zoomed away despite the protests of his friends behind him and within three more hours of strenuous flying ginny hermione and ron were nowhere in sight and he harry landed on the summit with a horrible mix of lightning rain winds gathering in the air around him weathering anything that dared stand in its way there was a dolmen near the center of peak made of battered stone black in color but with a strange glitter to it much like one would see in raw gold that hadntbeen extracted from the outcrop of rocks yet what kind of a place is this for the gateway to heaven he said aloud after walking around for twenty minutes more to the highest point possible next to the dolmen you idiot yelled a feminine voice from below him it was ginny and she didntlook happy what on earth were you thinking flying away from us like that she roared her eyes ablaze with rage ron appeared next an equal expression of disgust on his face you said you wouldntrun harry pretty retarded of you really another person on a broomstick came up the hills and harry braced himself for yet another reprimanding lecture from hermione however it was something far worse than that the death eaters had come that not that not hermione shouted harry ron and ginny whipped around momentarily stopping their admonishments how very observant of you pot started a sneer flipendo ron had roared halfway through the word observant the wizard halfway through speaking with a smirk on his face was blasted off the mountain ron had learnt never to bother listening to death eaters all they did was gloat sadistically moan or just laugh like a villain you would expect to see in a comic book but by then the others had come and much to harry surprise right behind the first five death eaters was hermione flying right behind a death eater and she wasnton a broomstick she looked exactly as hope had when she was battling the sprite shining metallic looking wings had protruded from her shoulders it looked like she finally found a way to call upon all of the veela blood within her landing down next to ron the monstrous changes in hermione had shrunk until all that was left were long scaly wings and sharp claws protruding from each finger harry had remembered before hermione had not if you will sprouted wings what had caused the change this time he would never know the four had now gathered into a tight ring in the center of the mound where the dolmen was blasting away in all directions as more of voldemort dark wizards zipped up the summit on their brooms multiplicus serpensortia shouted harry as he had not seen voldemort yet the snakes would be under his control as the sole parseltongue speaker spread out and kill harry hissed mercilessly despite the snakes the four friends were still furiously outnumbered all of them still standing unscathed only thanks to ginny watch and fortuna who was taking turns jumping from one to another deflecting spells just when harry knew they couldntstand it much longer a blast a bright green light flew straight towards him tempus immobulis shouted a voice and much to harry surprise the jet of light itself the killing curse stopped a meter away from him he ron hermione and ginny stepped gingerly away from the mound where the dolmen lay and started casting hexes at the death eaters frozen in time harry heard yells from the several death eaters not falling victim to the unpredictable time stopping charm and then much to his surprise came more wizards from the sides of the mountain owe you one neville yelled harry as he saw who had cast the charm the boy nodded grimly his face pale and returned his attention to the battle which had erupted again now that neville brief charm wore off this time however it seemed as though the death eaters were winning despite the interruption of the order charging up the mountain harry ginny ron and hermione now had been separated harry the only one left standing on the little mound that was the top of the summit and a face he had never expected to see again confronted him remember me potter snarled the man he did not grace the man with a reply and then harry really did remember doing a double take how does he remember my name so you thought it was fun to take away my memories did you spoke lucius softly hatred vibrating in every syllable he shouldntbe remembering anything at all reducto yelled harry all of a sudden protego drawled lucius and harry spell was absorbed i think it time to repay that favor potter damned would harry have been had he let lucius malfoy get a free shot off and take away all his memories he raised his wand in preparation lucius mirrored his exact position flipendo shouted ginny who had ran behind lucius malfoy lucius was blasted high into the skies off the mountain caught at unawares he looked rather comical as he hung in mid air for just a few seconds before he dropped down to the mountains below stop wasting your time with filth like that she hollered to harry furious with his own stupidity yet also relieved harry returned to the battle the duels raged on harry dodging the volleys of curses following him blasting an occasional death eater when the same trance that had took him earlier that day had grasped harry again his mind had become strangely numb at this point his wand arm falling to his side what are you doing harry cried fred or george voice maximus reducto he bellowed aiming his wand at the mound which he had stood on a few minutes ago still in a trancelike state he walked to the center of where the mound had been and stood harry looked down snapping out of the reverie he saw a strange symbol engraved into the earth where he stood take me to the pandemonium citadel he said and a green light rose around him the next thing he knew the summit was gone he found himself in a cold steel chamber every inch of wall was engraved with symbols and letters he shivered and looked around he felt fortuna shudder slightly on his shoulder purring softly to his left was a glittering window and to his right was a dark hole in the fortress directly in front of him was something he had hoped he would never see again it was the veil from the department of mysteries or else a veil that looked remarkably like it he turned to see what was behind him and nearly dropped his wand in shock hello potter it been a while twilight evabandmamber13 chapter twenty seven destiny call where s where harry roared ron over the chaos hermione and ginny had finally found their ways back to ron he blasted the dolmen there and then he just stupefy and he just what disappeared yelled ginny whipping around and yelling skeledestructo let go after him hollered hermione after dodging a curse aimed at her ron didntrespond but rather ran to the mound where the dolmen had stood as he ran however a curse caught him from behind and he let out a shriek falling and screaming his arm and part of his torso slumped the bone breaker curse ron man that felt good cried a voice ginny had reached ron by now and with inhuman strength spawned only from situations like these picked him up running away from the fray hermione however turned to the person who had shouted malfoy she spat he turned to her his eyes flickering from her sneaker covered toes to the stray strands of hair blown up by the wild winds he smirked my mudblood bastard you must feel nice granger he said conversationally as if they had met in the great hall at hogwarts and not a place heard merely in legends with hundreds of curses flying about some dangerously close to them feel nice she asked raising an eyebrow i guess you re not really my little mudblood anymore you do realize that the infusion of the more superior bloods has ridden you from the filth from your parents sneered draco still speaking conversationally his magic eyes rolling about in their sockets too bad an infusion of blood cantrid you of your filth retorted hermione you d have to remove all of your blood to do so oh touch hermione now turned the conversation more serious as she had a very nasty feeling of foreboding creeping up against her we have a score to settle malfoy she said in a cool tone a trait she had picked up in her time as a part veela do we granger his voice turned hard yes we do didntyou hear what i just said then settle it he said ignoring hermione last comment malfoy moved into the standard dueling position she moved into a quick dodge stance something she had picked up from watching harry i not counting down against the death eater that shoots on two said hermione skeptically code of honor replied draco raising up his hand what your honor worth a knut well actually less but i digress no countdown hermione raised her eyebrow nope granger pity we couldnthave another quick shag before i have to kill you oh woe is me avada kedavra shouted draco suddenly but hermione was ready she easily rolled to her left and jumped up so much for your honor malfoy snarled hermione draco laughed and reached into his pocket here take a knut granger my apologies he said strangely calm and collected throwing a knut in hermione face reducto she snarled and a round hole appeared in the middle of the knut she tossed it back just like your honor a big hole in it stupefy skeleincendio the spells bounced off each other and flew off in different directions mudblood he hissed the word you re looking for is part veela unless what you told me was wrong said hermione with a smirk avada ke transfiguro ferret hermione bellowed out of a strange reflex and in a loud crack a silvery ferret appeared where malfoy had stood a few seconds ago hermione laughed aloud ah the memories she said to the ferret goodbye malfoy the ferret started twittering like mad attempting to flee accio ferret the ferret zoomed back dejectedly obliviate said hermione coldly and draco remembered no more it been awhile potter spat lord voldemort harry scar flared up with pain but he managed to completely block it out this time there will be another time for pain he told himself not long enough said harry staring his nemesis in the eye voldemort however continued as if no interruption had taken place tell me potter how have you managed to escape me again and again even after your mudblood mother protection wore off dontcall my mother a mudblood voldemort laughed a high pitched mirthless laugh that chilled harry very bones you tell me what to do potter he laughed again the sound was as horrible to harry as a person dragging their fingernails down a blackboard why not after all my blood purer than yours harry snarled using voldemort own obsessions against him how dare you whispered voldemort question the sacred blood of the slytherin line crucio fortuna bounced the beam of light away and voldemort glared at the mysticat potter i have not brought you here so your cat could save you time and again i not running this time said harry you donthave a choice shrieked voldemort anti apparition fields anti portkey charms and all the wards you could find in a thousand tomes of ancient spells have been activated as soon as you appeared through the summit so you ve trapped yourself in said harry sounding more confident than he felt your insolence amuses me perhaps i ll allow you to live a few more minutes longer this way voldemort said recovering his cool the mood took a serious turn as harry locked eyes with lord voldemort harry could feel a strong warm feeling rush through his veins just like the phoenix song this ends tonight voldemort smiled wickedly yes it does potter yes it does at the summit winds were blowing ferociously biting the skin of those left alive ron a girl voice could be heard sobbing a boy was lying on the floor limp and helpless crying out with pain with a throat that was too dry to make a sound leave me said ron ginny felt tears come to her eyes no ron go we need every person we can get there nothing more you can do for me gin i going to take you back ron you re going to be okay no snapped ron gathering up the last of his energy ginny flinched at the hardness of her brother voice go we cantlose this fight he said and he fell to the floor sobbing a red headed girl bent over her brother body a few seconds later she bounded up rage consuming her she ran back into the fray her mind bent on revenge honora shouted lord voldemort in the echoing halls of the pandemonium fortress a massive cannonball of yellow light flew towards harry rondache conju he started but halfway through he realized that there would not be enough time harry jumped to the side and the ball of light smashed into the veil disappearing paristran magica shouted harry without saying a word lord voldemort waved his wand and the beam of light disappeared you realize potter that you cantpossibly win trixtonia he bellowed the shockwaves hit voldemort in the stomach and he fell back a few paces avada kedavra the spell was poorly aimed and harry did not even have to move to avoid it skeleincendio he roared the spell again found its target and lord voldemort let out a shriek of pain finally a spell that works much to his dismay however within a few seconds his enemy had recovered tsintsuacha hissed lord voldemort and a strange net flew towards harry not knowing what to do he cried protego but it was of no use the net smashed into harry and wrapped around him like a cocoon fortuna was blasted off his shoulder and collapsed against the wall with a piteous meow only then did he realize that the net was cold steel well well look what got caught in the mouse trap this time drawled voldemort slowly and casually son of a reducto cried harry the spell bounced right back into his leg causing a searing pain to come through him which he ignored he dropped his wand in pain and it fell out of the prison on to the floor next to voldemort did you really think i d give you a breakable prison potter asked voldemort obviously very pleased with trapping his opponent so cleverly now walking around harry stopping behind him is this how you win your usual fights riddle beat your opponents when they re trapped but then one would expect that from a person with blood like yours silence potter harry heart was beating hard in his chest but he knew that the only way he d survive was to taunt voldemort into letting him out you want to win fair and square lord let me out and let finish that battle but why should i let you out when i ve already won unless you re scared said harry cutting in with a long drawl voldemort laughed very well little mouse let play a little more with a wave of his wand harry tumbled out again voldemort kicked the fallen wand to harry emmendo harry said pointing the wand at his own leg then standing up he faced lord voldemort again time for round two the wind howled things were changing thunder roaring death blood it was the end of the path the beginning of the end had come the summit itself glowed eerily the very mountains trembling wind now so strong it butchered those without cloaks and bit at the face and eyes of the ones that did no more thought of battle came to any of their minds wizards from both sides focused just on keeping themselves alive whilst rain poured down on them and the bitter wind blew all things without roots clear off the top just one stood at the very top one ginny weasley who in her rage could not be moved the skies were dark around her she trembled she just as everyone else knew great things were happening expelliarmus crucio the spells clashed and bounced off each other yet again somewhere in this surreal place the rain from the earthly dimensions had come through and was pouring into the fortress at every second flipendo shouted harry zonareteco the spell smashed into harry and he felt a strange force tug from inside as if someone was trying to rip him into two pieces he grit his teeth as to not shout out he would not give lord voldemort the pleasure i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great flashes of his life came unbidden to his head the prophecy cedric lifeless eyes staring blankly up at him sirius his parents remus lupin who had died saving him dumbledore who had died needlessly so he would have the power it took to defeat voldemort and yet he stood here grimacing with pain get yourself together potter you owe it to them harry shut his eyes lord voldemort laughed a high pitched laugh which turned into a pathetic moan as harry opened his eyes again lord voldemort saw a defiance that was rarely seen in any of his combatants he had always managed to break them every last one of them impedimenta cried harry all of a sudden the spell served no purpose rather than to make lord voldemort stumble a few steps backwards in which he took his chance reducto he roared flipendo yelled voldemort after being hit by yet another spell stellartica lumare voldemort blinked harry saw yet another chance and just as he raised his wand he saw it lord voldemort is only immune to magical damage he suffered as harry could see from physical damage stumbling with each spell but what good is it to make him stumble crucio harry jumped aside reducto he cried it hit lord voldemort again flipendo shouted voldemort and harry was blasted across the room where he crashed against a candlestick holder his glasses knocked away a searing pain going up his arm he groaned voldemort shadow came closer and then he realized that his arm was impaled gritting his teeth he wrenched his arm out from the now blood covered candlestick stand clutching his wound the rain washed his blood over the floor so that the ground beneath him was stained and then harry felt it it was an emotion that could not be described in words it was similar to the trances he had received earlier only this time he wasntcontrolled at all he knew what he had to do picking himself up off the ground he started sprinting towards the shadow that was lord voldemort voldemort taken aback did nothing to stop him harry leaped into the air tempus rewindo he yelled his voice drowned out by the rain lord voldemort for the first time in a long while was at a loss where had the boy gone he turned around clutching his wand the boy was nowhere how was this possible another few seconds passed had he escaped again but no potter would not leave his little pet he was hiding somewhere come out potter i had not brought you here to hide but he was nowhere serpensortia find him he hissed in parseltongue the snake slithered off he lord voldemort was now a bit nervous he cannot have left it isntpossible and then he heard a roar harry burst into a lion upon returning letting out a bloodcurdling roar still flying through the air rain beating down upon him he crashed into lord voldemort and with yet another roar smashed the wand out of his hands the wand snapped in two as it hit the ground awkwardly such adrenaline he had never known was pumping through his veins he let out another savage roar as he extended his massive claws and swiped at lord voldemort he let out a shriek of pain yes the human part of harry thought but the lion part of him caught fire in this heated battle and was now fighting furiously much to his surprise however the gashes that he had left merely seconds ago disappeared but in the accursed veil that had been his godfather bane he had at last found a solution sinking his jaws into the throat of lord voldemort he ran and dragged him to the veil then as lord voldemort struggled to stand he turned back into his seventeen year old self it ends now riddle good riddance and with strength no one would suspect from his lanky frame he grabbed lord voldemort by the neck lifting him up inches into the air he ignored the elder man desperate kicks towards his body pain is for later and with the last of his strength he raised his wand and yelled wingardium leviosa and so raising the body of the most feared sorcerer in the world he sent him flying into the veil then came such a destructive force unseen in the long years of magical history as a gargantuan burst of energy was released from the veil of death consuming itself and spreading to obliterate the very foundations of the ethereal pandemonium citadel and a seventeen year old boy clutched his now glowing white scar drowning in pain and harry potter collapsed onto the floor and for him in a flash of fire before his eyes he knew no more at the summit the winds and rain died down huh mumbled hermione who had been hanging onto a large root with one hand and ron hand with another she quickly dragged ron onto a mound of dirt and raised her head to the girl standing a few meters away from her it it stopped whispered ginny it stopped it over hermione what s and then it sunk in harry where harry shouted hermione and as if in answer a burst of fire appeared right before her eyes and a boy with a cat slumped on top of him landed at her feet and a phoenix flying overhead harry she shrieked what where cried ginny running to hermione harry oh no i think moaned hermione as she looked at the two bodies on the floor no hermione yelled ginny making hermione jump harry answer me yelled ginny shaking his motionless body ginny started hermione tears now sliding down her cheeks at an alarming rate harry wake up she cried now furiously slapping harry ginny said hermione again but this time finding the strength to finish her sentence he s he gone no he not shouted ginny now moving over to feel for a pulse but even as she did so her face gradually grew deadened until she collapsed entirely and started beating the ground with her fists sobbing her heart away sirius black snarled as he saw a crippled form of an old man topple into his realm looks like my godson has finally done his job he spat bitterly the old man jumped up stay away fool dontyou know who i am i am lord voldemort he said in what was obviously meant to be an intimidating tone but came out as a croak sirius laughed a mirthless laugh you dontunderstand do you lord stay away no you don t down here you dontgive orders down here you re nothing the man tried to laugh but the sound came out as a dry cough down here i the boss snarled sirius three years of indescribable suffering had hardened him driven him to a state of psychosis no traces of the joyful person he was as a child left in him look at yourself voldemort or should i say riddle only then did the once high and mighty lord voldemort realize that as he fell through the veil his earthly transformations were removed he was human again don t go away moaned the man piteously who without a wand could no longer instill fear or command anyone let alone this looming shadow in front of him this is what i ve been waiting for tom riddle i here to finish my godson job i ve seen it all the shadow grew and grew a mysterious darkness engulfed the body of tom riddle and as the shadow shrunk he was no more sirius black let out a laugh of insanity before calling on the powers picked up over three bitter long years and turned them on himself as he consumed his own substantial body his wraith like existence with his own bitterness his spirit was freed at last and sirius black finally returned to his long lost friends harry floated through empty space is this death it isntso bad after all he thought as he glided through the strange emptiness that could not be described as air he swept across the skies towards a glowing white light he raised his hand to his eyes to no effect he saw that his hands were see through am i a ghost suddenly he felt something jerk on his stomach and he felt himself land hard onto a bed and he could feel that he was completely solid wake up harry called a voice it was all a dream he thought dimly a long dream at that just a few more minutes aunt petunia he mumbled and turned over why i never that wasntaunt petunia voice he opened his eyes and found himself face to face with another set of bright green eyes in a face framed by dark red hair he gasped it was his mother lily evans potter twilight evabanmamber13 chapter twenty eight the small things all the small things true care truth brings i ll take one lift you re right best trip always i know you ll be at my show watching waiting commiserating say it aintso i will not go turn the lights off carry me home blink 182 all the small things are are you alive croaked harry in amazement lily stepped away from her son no harry no spell can bring back the dead images suddenly flashed through harry mind dad i have a month to learn to be an animagus a month training pain the exhilaration of being a lion flying through the skies slashing roaring wingardium leviosa the soft swaying of the veil and then the explosion fire agony scar am i dead said harry lily much to his surprise smiled sadly only if you want to be harry what do you mean it means harry you ve been granted a choice dumbledore professor it so good to see you cried harry and sprung off his comfortable soft bed anxious to speak more with the wizard harry stopped about a foot away from dumbledore why did you do it whispered harry suddenly dumbledore looked into his eyes twinkling blue meeting tired green because you were the prophesized one if you ll pardon my words said dumbledore letting out a hearty laugh you were the only one to defeat lord voldemort no one else spells had even a meager effect on him not even my own my sacrifice was to buy you the strength you needed to get to him but let not speak of this now there are some people that want to see you harry said a male voice harry remembered from his month training as an animagus his dad dad you ve done well harry harry couldnthelp but smile hello harry came another voice fringed with joy remus cried harry with delight running to the man who he had gotten to know so much better in his sixth year i never got a chance to thank you for doing that remus face also went somber let not speak of that here harry you re in a better place now but where am i asked harry but before anyone else could interrupt yet another person came into his room hey harry smiled sirius sheepishly sirius he cried out yet again and ran towards his godfather giving him a hard hug i sorry i let you down harry you didntsirius i it was my fault i so sorry started harry i never should ve been that thick sirius held up a hand dontmention it harry you re here with us now harry stomach suddenly dropped despite seeing the ones he loved in front of him so i really dead yes and no harry cut in dumbledore what do you mean you ve been granted a choice said dumbledore again what choice asked harry not daring to hope as you rendered an extraordinary service to the light the gods have decided to offer you an option whether to stay with us in the heavens or to return to the earthly existence everyone stared intently on harry what you cantjust make me this is beyond my control harry here we are all equals none of us which have the strength to comprehend let alone defeat the godly powers he stared at his mother and father whom he never really got to know in his real life he stared at dumbledore his mentor the person who had sacrificed so much to help him he turned to remus his friend his source of comfort and adult care besides from molly weasley after sirius had passed away and last he turned to sirius he saw the hopeful gleam in sirius eyes and he couldnthelp but wonder whether it would be worth it or not to stay here and leave his pain and sorrow behind i the whole room leaned in closer to harry i cantdecide said harry softly take your time harry said lily patting harry arm and smiling in the sad way she had done when he asked if he was dead one by one they filed out of the room harry exhausted fell promptly asleep upon waking he saw his mother and father sitting next to him on chairs whispering quietly but stopping as soon as they saw he was awake i cantdecide whispered harry i dontknow what i want you will harry you just need a little help what do you mean come on we ll take you to the room of seeing harry despite everything couldnthelp but snort you mean like divination no none of that garbage this stuff is real said james harry rolled out of bed finding himself fully dressed and followed after his parents they walked along beautiful gleaming white halls sunlight shining down on them and doves flying overhead lily had locked his arm in hers and led him down a small corridor which had a dead end where a door stood engraved with many runes and symbols what is this this is the room of seeing you must go through alone er okay said harry and nervously he stretched his hand to the doorknob and opened the door he walked into the dim halls and in the center was an altar slowly he made his way there as he looked down towards the altar a voice made him jump hello harry potter my name is erised what can i assist you with harry thought for a second he didntreally know what he was here for other than it was to help him make a choice i need to make a decision i need to see what i really want in my heart the man called erised stopped and stroked his beard i dontusually allow it but i believe i will allow you a glimpse into the seeing goblet and also a glimpse of the mirror harry didntno how to respond so he just nodded and said thank you kindly step up next to the altar and kneel instructed erised harry did as he was told feeling rather nervous erised walked over to him and placed a goblet in front of his face look deeply into the goblet and it will show you what you wish to see in the earthly realm harry now feeling self conscious and foolish looked into the goblet he nearly blacked out at the sight why harry why did you leave me sobbed ginny clutching onto a body ginny harry please come back please come back to me ginny we have to go the order everyone leaving i love you harry why did you have to go come back i command you come back ginny we need to get ron to st mungo s there nothing more you can do for harry but ginny made no response sobbing hugging and kissing a limp lifeless body his body no harry yelled calm yourself harry potter i ginny but harry felt like screaming but the eerie man mere presence calmed him take a look into the mirror harry reluctantly stood and before him a mirror was placed erised erised this is the mirror he said remembering something the mirror of erised i found it in my first year at hogwarts it shows you your heart innermost desires said both of them at once look into the mirror said erised again harry moved himself into the center having a faint idea of what he was going to see first he saw just himself and then it a petite redhead appeared next to him smiling her arm around his waist he patted his own waist unconsciously forgetting that it was just an image on his other side a tall redhead had his arm around a smaller girl a bushy haired girl with brown eyes and large front teeth behind him then appeared his family or what he considered as his family his mother his father sirius remus dumbledore mr and mrs weasley bill charlie fred and george and percy even on top of his head was a small kitten this doesntanswer my question erised he said softly and even as he said so the shapes behind him waved and disappeared until it was just himself ginny ron hermione and fortuna in the mirror fortuna was next to go disappearing into thin air harry absentmindedly patted his messy hair ron and hermione smiled back at him and slowly slower than the others they too faded away and all that was left was ginny and even there as he looked into those bright brown eyes the flaming hair set on her shoulders in the very realm of heaven harry potter knew what his choice had to be i have to go back said harry to the room filled with his loved ones there was no response besides for lily hugging him tightly i sorry said harry looking around at everyone no harry do not grieve we will meet again i sure said dumbledore his eyes still twinkling here he seemed to be joyful in all due time said james you have a life to live harry you have earned it it all thanks to you he said addressing the entire room every person had in his or her own way contributed goodbye harry said dumbledore extending his hand harry grabbed it and also pulled the old man into a hug goodbye professor dumbledore said harry thank you for everything you ve done for me dumbledore nodded and he swept out of the room remus lupin stepped up next harry you ve come a long way from the boy who was down on not being able to go to hogsmeade once he said with a smile nodding at harry harry pulled him into a hug too goodbye remus goodbye harry and with a slight sniff remus lupin exited sirius shot a look at lily and james and sighed walking up to harry he voluntarily pulled his godson into a hug take care of yourself harry he said gruffly trying to sound unemotional and failing horribly you ve made me proud harry you truly are a great wizard and a better godson than than anyone could ever ask for goodbye goodbye harry he bowed his head and walked towards the exit looking miserable sirius dontleave said lily he stopped dead in his tracks please lily i cantdo it again sirius called harry he turned around not raising his head you were a good godfather too sirius raised his eyes meeting harry s smiled and then left the room mum dad i just realized i donteven know how to get back started harry feeling rather foolish just focus on the reason why you want to and you ll be there lily and james now wrapped harry in a hug tears sliding down all of their faces we re proud of you son we ll always watch over you we always have said james smiling at his son if you ever miss us harry look to the light said lily now also smiling we love you harry they said together mum dad i love you too and even as lily potter bent down and kissed her son one last time on the forehead he disappeared from their realm back to the world he left behind harry awoke suddenly wheezing gasping for air his throat dry he found himself on a white bed and he sat up looking around water he said blankly oh my god shrieked someone right next to him water he repeated harry shrieked the girl and he felt a pair of arms pull around his neck strangling him hot tears dripped down his shirt it was ginny water he rasped harry asked ginny looking confused all of a sudden water he yelled and immediately regretted it his throat already burning just hurt more something wrong with me i think i need to lie down hermione called ginny feeling for something to sit on harry sprung up and he walked to a sink he spotted across the room and placing his head underneath the tap he drank deeply ginny fainted it was just then that harry realized that he was no longer in the pandemonium citadel where he should ve been where am i he wondered aloud walking over to ginny who are you snarled a voice behind him hermione i harry dontyou recognize you died harry said hermione softly and i alive again you re either some idiot death eater dumber beyond imagination or i insane well i ve always wondered what was up with all the studying harry she gasped incredulously miracles happen but how but dontfaint on me now hermione said harry fighting back a grin is it really you harry yes hermione it really me smiled harry you d think i d get used to miracles happening now spending seven years with harry potter arentyou asked harry hermione fainted it was two weeks later when harry hermione ron and ginny found themselves back at hogwarts freshly out of st mungo hospital where they had spent two weeks discussing and sharing stories of what had happened on the summit and what happened after harry battle with lord voldemort much to harry relief his best friends had escaped alive and with no lasting injuries besides for ron whose doctor warned him a hard hit to the chest perhaps by a bludger would shatter his ribcage again neville and luna escaped with just a few scrapes and in luna case a concussion hermione remained untouched besides for the cuts and scrapes from the trek upwards and ginny the same hermione had handed the cure over to snape upon arriving at st mungo s and harry heard that muggles were on the verge of recovery and the muggle born were already completely freed of the plague the dark floods a product of voldemort wizardry died with him and the world was slowly recovering despite the aids of magic repairs took a long time death eaters had either fled or surrendered immediately realizing the fall of their master as the dark marks on their arms ceased to burn and as the ministry aurors surprisingly under a new minister had rounded up all of those who surrendered after the order had chased them down the himalayas where tonks had managed to call the aurors and inform them of their location and they were now held temporarily in the dungeons of the ministry of magic until azkaban could be fully reclaimed and new prisoner guards established dementors found lurking were treated to no mercy their treason was enough to warrant them death harry suspected that there werentany more dementors left in great britain anymore meanwhile although harry hadntpersonally read anything himself the press was now publishing a harry potter section on the daily prophet new biographies were released by the hour how they managed to get all the information down in so short a time harry would never know on the wireless there was a harry potter show where witches would call and tell the hostess just what they loved about him it was all very out of hand and harry was finding it harder and harder to block it all out lucius malfoy corpse was never found and this worried harry greatly death eaters still walking free was a menace to the wizarding world he had laughed about hermione battle with draco malfoy and hermione placing the transfiguring spell that only she could undo on him then wiping his memories ron did a very accurate imitation of a wheezing tomato when he had heard and a strict nurse that attended to the three of them snapped at him and made him take another dose of skele gro harry had then heard confidentially from snape that the new minister for magic a person by the name of tanner was secretly negotiating with the muggle world about the confidentiality of the wizarding world snape had told harry that the majority of the muggle leadership had already agreed for a mass memory modifying so that the two world could live in harmony personally harry didntsee how the entire world of people could be memory charmed but thankfully it was not his problem to worry about anymore hogwarts as mcgonagall had informed them was being turned back into a school and they were preparing to welcome back students in a few weeks to continue their studies in fact many of the students who had actively helped in the war were already at hogwarts all would ve been perfect for harry had it not been for ginny she had stormed into his room one morning kissed him passionately and then much to his surprise slapped him hard on the face and stormed right out again saying i ll never forgive you harry he had tried to laugh about it with ron and hermione who assured him that ginny was just over reacting and she d be better in no time but it didntlook like she d be getting over anything anytime soon ginny shied away from ron hermione and harry upon arrival at hogwarts spending time with her parents bill and charlie harry had not told his friends everything about his brief lodging in the heavens he found that almost a day had passed since his body was found dropped by fawkes the phoenix fortuna on the other hand seemed to go through the same miracle as harry dumbledore had been right the mysticat truly was tied to his own fate right now harry was left alone on the quidditch field ron and hermione in hogsmeade with ginny who had kindly asked for harry not to come but harry didntmind his friends leaving him alone would give him some time to reflect he summoned his firebolt boarded and flew up high into the skies this was where he truly felt powerful despite whatever people see of him on the ground whereas hogwarts now felt somewhat changed since the last battle and the trek up the summit the skies did not the air was his domain harry dived furiously towards the ground pulling out at the last second very well little mouse let play a little more stellartica lumare tempus rewindo the lion inside his soul just waiting to be called upon harry did another dive sheer exhilaration in his veins as the tremendous feeling of wind rushing against his face took him this is the end riddle good riddance pain is for later he had indeed lay in pain in the dim room in st mungo s the nurses telling him that he had broken seven bones ripped four muscles and suffered from internal bleeding almost everywhere in his body harry had actually been scared but then learnt from hermione that internal bleeding was just another way for saying bruises he spiraled upwards into the sky to the level of the clouds hssssroar screams if you ever miss us harry look to the light he wheeled about on his broomstick and dived forcing his firebolt to its limit and down he came like a bolt of lightning just barely managing to swerve away from the ground his thoughts were jumbled his mind absolutely full he now fully realized what dumbledore had meant when he first found harry over the pensieve in his office remembering the palm sized pensieve his father had gave him he landed down on the floor and began walking up to the castle intent on placing some memories in before going to dinner hey harry said a voice hey parvati remember in our sixth year when you said he had indeed parvati i think we should take a break started harry awkwardly hmm yes sighed parvati no not that kind of break a break from us harry and parvati i think we should just be friends parvati looked shocked why she said frowning look with lord voldemort parvati flinched see you canteven hear his name without being scared if you re with me he ll come after you it only a matter of time before he comes after me again i cantbear to be responsible for anyone i know and like that is love to get hurt goodbye parvati harry said and started walking away what about after when you know who is defeated sniffed parvati if i alive we ll give it another try then shall we harry just one last kiss please said parvati tears now sliding gently down her cheeks we ll save that for the victory day too parvati he left a gently crying parvati sitting on the couch so much had changed since then for starters there was ginny and ginny in herself was already more than enough reason i sorry parvati but harry no parvati i m i with ginny now then before he knew it parvati had grabbed him into an embrace pulling his face down to hers and pulling him into a fiery kiss parva he started but it was too late she had already begun the kiss and slid her tongue into his mouth and slowly harry felt his hormones start to get the better of him he broke away whether to gasp for air or to stop the kiss he no longer knew parvati i dontlove you anymore i don t i with ginny now dontdo that again he gasped we re nothing now parvati it over parvati eyes flickered downwards looks like not all of you agrees she pulled him closer but this time he resisted no parvati he said this time his eyes serious i love ginny parvati we re over and before she could respond harry grabbed his fallen broomstick and flew up to the castle not looking back harry walked down feeling reasonably cheerful after placing his firebolt back into his trunk down to the great hall for dinner dimly thinking about having some mashed potatoes and ham when a fist suddenly rammed into his stomach caused a slight diversion he was stunned for just a second before recovering his wits whipping out his wand and cried flipendo ron was blasted away from him crashing against a wall ron asked harry you bastard bellowed ron and ran at harry again impedimenta cried harry frightfully afraid that ron was under the imperius curse what wrong with you you snogged parvati you re going out with my little sister he yelled and miraculously harry spell was broken and ron ran at him again harry grabbed ron fists ron kicked him in the shins look ron come i ll explain it all explain what said a cold voice damn people do seem to have a knack for running into me when i dontwant them there dontthey it was ginny and next to her a very worried looking hermione gin began harry dontcall me gin who said i was talking to you i was about to say ginger beer when you just cut in snapped harry lately ginny had rather annoyed him with her behavior and he didntfeel she deserved any patience just then it not like he actually did anything ron had told him she just didntfeel like speaking to him what he had done to warrant such treatment he didntknow women crazy that what they are he had thought angrily if it hadntbeen for the mirror of erised showing him that what he really wanted in life was ginny he probably wouldnthave graced her with a reply ron despite being angry with harry at that moment chortled ginny glared at harry with an strange expression of mixed something harry couldntquite place and a strong dose of hate looking rather comical and walked away purposely at a very slow pace making harry eyes follow her all the way until she took a turn and the bright red hair disappeared look harry i ll talk to her tonight okay said hermione sadly and she quickly followed ginny he sighed c mon ron he said pulling his friend up i ll tell you what you missed in your snog fests with hermione last year we were on prefect yeah whatever said harry and beckoned to ron to follow to the marauder room that slut said ron angrily relax nothing happened that how parvati plays she queen of passion and gobstones remember what dean said and she knows you re seeing ginny relax ron it what i said in sixth year when i actually liked her still harry interrupted fred and george had once said it was better to cut off mrs weasley before she builds up a head of steam and continues for hours harry had found it works with all weasleys chess ron nah dinner first and then then you get reminded what losing feels like harry smiled things would never be quite the same he thought but right now as he saw the twinkling light of challenge in his best friend eyes if things indeed couldntever go back than this is how he d want it to be just the small things in life things we notice and never really thought about ron obsession with chess and quidditch hermione obsession with books and learning and ginny everything from her shining eyes to her caring but fiery personality harry took in and loved dontworry weasley i know plenty about losing ron looked slightly taken aback for a second but seeing harry smile he returned it now c mon let go get some potatoes before ginny eats it all said ron that girl does eat a lot when she in a foul mood harry laughed last one to the hall a flea bitten kneazle he said in a sing song voice and laughing joyfully the boy who lived conqueror of lord voldemort hero of the world at large ran out of the portrait hole and sprinted down the halls a tall redhead following in his footsteps twilight evabanmamber13 a n the next chapter is the very last chapter and i know your just going to love the ending so i thinking of making you wait for but then again maybe i wonti guess you will just have to wait and see chapter twenty nine back to normalcy it was a warm july morning and harry was sitting at the gryffindor table eating a piece of toast with a large goblet of pumpkin juice next to him mcgonagall had informed the students they could either finish their disrupted studies over the summer holidays or they could wait until next year and retake the whole year of study again about a quarter of the students chose to finish their studies over the holidays most of them being seventh sixth and fifth year students including harry ron hermione and ginny recently there had been a memorial service in which hundreds of witches and wizards had turned up for in honor of those who had fallen in the second war in truth however although the war was over the threat of the death eaters surely wasn t half the death eaters were unaccounted for and were being searched for by the ministry aurors harry was glad that he didntneed to join the fight he felt he had deserved a rest at last selfish as it may sound on this particular morning however harry was fed up despite it being the day of an awards ceremony and a special celebration quidditch match at hogwarts between the other schools of europe mainly featuring students from beauxbatons and durmstrang this quidditch match featured the best students from all of the school and it was with a purpose of celebrating the victory of the second war and to honor the bonds of friendship between the countries many witches and wizards were to come harry had seen professor flitwick enlarging the stands and adding more seats to them harry would ve been nervous a couple of years back but conquering the most evil wizard in the universe kind of had a strange effect on you ginny had been very noticeably purposely avoiding him in the halls taking long cuts to avoid seeing him and when they did collide paths she determinedly looked the other direction at breakfast harry cornered ginny gin i need to talk to you this time there was no comment like dontcall me gin but rather a nervous glance towards ron who shrugged apologetically as if to say sorry harry got a point he should be able to talk to you and ginny looking slightly deflated got up and followed harry look gin please ron and hermione wonttell me what wrong and i just cantstand us being like this please what did i do this time ginny said shortly nothing as ginny turned away harry grasped her shoulder roughly and her jumper slid to the side holding ginny back ginny made an angry face and harry quickly said sorry gin but if it nothing why are you why are we like this at last defeated ginny looked into harry eyes she looked rather like a lost little child then and it was all harry could do to stop himself from hugging her tightly then you want to know i wouldntask otherwise fine meet me down in the common room at midnight bring your invisibility cloak or get the one you gave hermione and leaving harry wondering ginny scampered away potter potter hollered mcgonagall from the staff table wondering what he could ve possibly down now he walked up to the table yes professor i ve been trying to give you some time some time off from your letters but i think it time you start either burning them or reading them the room of requirement is full of them er okay professor i ll get started on it now and potter if you arenttoo busy tonight come to my office we have a serious matter we need to discuss harry nodded and walked out of the great hall speculating what people would write to him about and what mcgonagall wanted at night he walked alone to the room of requirement waving to a few people along the way including a very embarrassed looking parvati patil harry didntthink that girl had ever known flat out rejection before she did seem to get used to having things her way as he walked absentmindedly into the room of requirement he gasped on a large table in the center of the table were three crates not small shoebox like crates either crates the size of a bathtub damn said harry softly i going to need reinforcements for this hey look harry another marriage proposal cried dean who was helping harry open his fan mail along with almost all of the gryffindor seventh years nope this one doesntbelieve you vanquished him he says its all propaganda and a conspiracy by the ministry to cover up that they made a deal with you know voldemort said ron firmly what a load of rubbish you reckon that person knows luna said seamus with a wink receiving a scowl from neville hermione gasped what asked ron looking up from his pile of ripped envelopes dear mr potter how goes your love triangle with hermione granger and ronald weasley i could offer some help with that i hear ron is pretty damn please dontfinish that letter said harry looking sick harry picked up the next letter one hedwig had just dropped in dear mr potter he read where are you and mr weasley the match starts now harry yelped ron what harry the match ron in turn yelped and they ran out of the room leaving a stunned crowd of seventh year gryffindors hanging inside the room what are you waiting for yelled seamus as if on cue the rest of the gryffindors piled out of the room sprinting for the quidditch field where were you potter gasped a frantic looking professor mcgonagall sorry opening my fanmail ron coughed something that sounded most suspiciously like lockhart hurry up and get changed cried mcgonagall again throwing robes in harry and ron faces er professor said harry what you re still here you changed in front of alicia spinnet katie bell and angelina johnson for years and you never complained then snapped mcgonagall i old enough to be your grandmother potter dontthink i haventseen my fair share of please professor please dontfinish that sentence gulped ron mcgonagall swept out of the changing room nonetheless and harry and ron quickly through on the robes accio firebolts cried harry and the two brooms flew towards him tossing ron his broomstick harry ran to the rest of his team where ginny susan bones ernie macmillan michael corner and terry boot were standing harry smugly observed there were no slytherins on the hogwarts team alright men he said gasping ginny cleared her throat yeah as i was saying continued harry this time susan cleared her throat oh right and women he added rolling his eyes this is it asked ron the big one asked ginny giggling harry paused for just a second smiling at her the one we ve all been waiting for hey that copyright wood material cried ron okay okay let just go out there and show them why hogwarts is the best for hogwarts shouted the team and i present to you our very own hogwarts all star team yelled dean voice magically amplified harry smirked apparently they had managed to get down here in time after all they did not fly out together but entered one by one as was the special entry mcgonagall had planned chaser virginia weasley cried dean and ginny with a nervous little smile on her face zoomed out above the field to loud applause from the hogwarts students and a vast majority of the visitors chaser ernie macmillan ernie zoomed out ron began jumping up and down nervously chaser susan bones susan flew out to more applause beater michael corner michael followed suit to slightly less applause from the hogwarts crowd to harry surprise beater terry boot the applause went up again as terry nervously flew up to join his teammates keeper ron weasley ron his face white flew out after terry leaving harry feeling slightly nervous and the seeker started dean the applause if possible got even louder as the foreign schools also applauded and almost all of hogwarts besides the slytherins stood and stomped their feet the captain of the hogwarts team roared dean the one the only harry potter bellowed dean so loud that harry eardrums hurt and the tumultuous applause that followed it only made it worse harry jumping on his broomstick flew out to the crowd trying his best to block out the cheers and screams but as soon as he joined his teammates everything felt right again all his nervousness gone he was in the skies again captains shake hands yelled madam hooch he flew forwards to where a very pretty girl with silvery blonde hair was hovering she smiled and giggled fluttering her eyelashes as she shook his hand bitch he heard a voice behind him mutter good luck arry said the girl with a heavy french accent and you too said harry and withdrawing his hand he flew back to his position harry observed as hooch let out the snitch and the bludgers managing to keep his eye on the snitch for just a few seconds before it disappeared from sight and the quaffle is released yelled dean voice as hooch raised the ball to the air with a flick of her wand as he heard hooch whistle signaling the start of the game he hurled away up to the skies the blonde girl captain of the international team tailed him harry now flew up high surveying the pitch for a glint of gold the blonde girl about fifty feet below him watching the game below him he whooped aloud as he saw ron pull off yet another brilliant save sending the quaffle flying back halfway across the pitch straight into ginny hands as ginny sped towards the goalpost the international team began to crowd her in alarm harry dived down for ginny causing the other team seeker to zoom down after him but ginny didntneed his help spiraling upwards in a move he himself had taught her in his sixth year she dodged them all and with a clever feint threw the quaffle like a fireball into the hoop for ten points harry then realized that he shouldnthave been down at playing level at all immediately correcting his mistake he went back up to the skies just as the blonde girl dived down with a yelp he zoomed after her only to watch her swerve away from the ground at the last second damn harry muttered the blonde girl winked at him seductively or at least as seductively as one could hovering in the air and zoomed away across the pitch harry decided that it was time to take matters into his own hands operation hufflepuff he roared it was the code name he had given to the strategy they had taken against hufflepuff using himself as a surrogate chaser and here potter is calling a gamble started dean but as he zoomed forwards he finally managed to block out all the commentary ginny he hollered ginny who had been speeding up the field merely dropped the quaffle and by pure momentum it landed where harry was ernie and susan were flanking harry and ginny who were going forwards like an arrow tossing the ball into the air he gave a perfect pass for ernie who spiked it through the left hoop but even as cheers erupted harry heart dropped the blonde girl was streaking down halfway across the pitch full of determination harry pushed his broom to the limit as he streaked down the pitch faster than any in the crowd had ever seen before save perhaps from viktor krum the blonde girl had her arm outstretched faster he yelled at his broom he could see the snitch now but the girl was still closer now he roared and with the momentum of his broomstick favoring his movement he leaped off kicking off the handle propelling himself forwards at a blindingly fast speed and as he jumped for the fluttering golden snitch small petite hands blocked his way out of pure luck he with his feet managed to kick the snitch away from the girl grasp only to fall to the floor himself with a loud crack in his shoulders harry hollered his team every one of them flying to him go he roared grimacing in pain win this one for hogwarts accio broomstick as his faithful firebolt came towards him again he mounted with a cracked ribcage and a mangled left arm and rejoined the fray and captain potter returns roared dean timeout hollered ron no yelled harry who had just seen it the fluttering speck of gold amidst a fiery mane of red the snitch was in ginny hair flying towards ginny discreetly as to not attract attention from the rival seeker he increased his pace as he extended his hand for the golden snitch in ginny hair she yelped and tried to fly away the snitch with her but harry had soon caught up with her sweeping his fingers gently through her silky hair harry nearly forgot for a moment just why he was there and almost where there was but as the seconds passed harry gently swept the golden snitch out of her fiery mane of hair and with a broad grin on his face he bellowed i ve got the snitch the crowd exploded with its loudest roar yet so loud that harry could see birds flying out of the forbidden forest and so loud that harry felt his very broomstick was shaking and as he turned around he caught a glimpse of ginny face which held a grin almost as wide as his own and as she flew up wrapping her arms around him and planting a quick chaste kiss on his lips he realized that he got a lot more than the golden snitch the rest of his team ron in the lead flew towards him their mouths open shouting words that no one could hear actual tears in some of their eyes and as they did a victory lap around the quidditch field together to deafening applause for the first time in a long while harry was in bliss and even as he landed into a field swarmed with students and visitors alike he noticed that in one hand was still the struggling snitch and the other hand held tightly onto ginny s however as they left the highly charged atmosphere of the quidditch field harry suddenly found much to his dismay that ginny had again turned away from him to ron and were excitedly gabbling about the match even as they walked to the awards ceremony held out on the grounds where a massive tent was erected the four of them had dressed up in their very best robes after a long shower and a huge feast ready to receive awards they knew were going to be presented to them harry walked into the tent with hermione ron and ginny laughing uproariously about something behind them the insides of the tent harry noticed were obviously magical instead of a plain empty space there was a massive hall filled with seats and in the very front of the tent was a stage where tonks could be seen tampering with a wizarding microphone catching harry eye she winked at him c mon lets go get seats said ron finding seats near the back of the hall harry ron hermione and ginny sat down and waited for the ceremony to begin ten minutes later when everyone had piled into the tent the new minister a tall lanky man by the name of john macdonald harry was told that it was a girl that went to hogwarts father stood up at the stage it is with both sorrow and with joy that we gather here today in honor of those who fought against lord voldemort during the second war firstly we take a moment of silence for those who fell the minister closed his eyes and almost everyone in the hall followed suit when the moment of silence passed the minister let out a strained smile but as for now we gather to celebrate those who are still amongst us those who proved themselves to be extraordinary heroes and without further ado i give you professor minerva mcgonagall headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and our fine hostess for today programs of quidditch the excellent feast you have all just enjoyed and now the awards ceremony the minister stepped aside and sat down on a seat in the front row we honor cedric diggory first to fall victim to lord voldemort on and on went professor mcgonagall going through a massive list of names and people some of them earning small awards ron had just let out a loud yawn causing several old witches to glare at him when mcgonagall announced that the order of merlin awards would be given by the minister himself ms nymphadora tonks order of merlin third class for combating lord voldemort troops on the front line tonks her hair now strawberry blonde and long enough to touch the small of her back beamed and walked to receive her award shaking the minister hand to a series of clicks and flashes from cameras smiling tonks walked off the stage in her hand a badge and a certificate then there was about forty more people all who were from the order of the phoenix or from the hogwarts students of dumbledore army that went up to get their awards including fred george bill charlie mr and mrs weasley neville cho and luna harry observed that percy did not receive a reward ms minerva mcgonagall second class for heading the fortress hogwarts against the dark forces and also for combating on the front lines mcgonagall stood up a smile on her face and accepted the award gladly and flushed red as the minister kissed her hand as mcgonagall came down the minister began again mr severus snape for heading the army that brought about the defeat of the death eaters at the himalayan mountains i present to you the order of merlin second class snape stood not even a ghost of a smile on his face nodded politely taking his award he followed mcgonagall mr rubeus hagrid for rallying the giants and now providing both communities with another chance at peace i award you the order of merlin second class hagrid walked up nervously shook the minister hand and pinning the little badge on his shirt he beamed for the audience then followed suit mr ronald weasley for extraordinary valor and skill in the battles of hogwarts and the battle of the summit i award you the order of merlin first class ron walked up beaming so widely harry thought mentally that if he was any happier his face would burst ron then walked off the stage trying to get back to harry ginny and hermione but was ambushed by his mother who had grabbed him and hugged him furiously causing ron to blush wiggle and struggle whilst a tearful mrs weasley could be seen saying something in his ear harry couldnthear as he was halfway across the hall the minister cleared his throat and mrs weasley immediately went quiet pulling ron down next to her miss virginia weasley for immense contributions to the effort of the war both in battle and out of battle fred and george could be heard snickering i present to you the order of merlin first class ginny then followed ron footsteps a dazzling grin on her face as she went up to retrieve her award ginny unlike ron went straight to her mother receiving hugs from her entire family miss hermione granger continued the minister for an extraordinary exhibit of both intelligence and bravery in the face of danger countless times in the second war i present to you the order of merlin first class hermione with a huge hug for harry nearly skipped up to the stage where she received the award stood for pictures a few younger wizards in the crowd had catcalled at her then went to her parents who were sitting in a specially charmed booth for muggles so they could see just what exactly was going on and last but certainly not least mr harry potter for personally bringing down the hammer on the world most feared dark wizard in centuries for a gargantuan contribution to the war and for an excellently played quidditch match said the minister getting whoops of approval and laughter from the audience i present to you the order of merlin first class as harry walked up to the stage and the minister pinned the badge onto his robes he smiled for the cameras and he was nearly blinded as he walked off the stage not knowing where to go hermione was waving furiously to him and so were the weasleys but he suddenly remembered hermione words from christmas time i love you harry you re my brother and it doesntmatter if you werentborn as my brother or even if you consider yourself to be you ll still be my brother my family you might not have your blood family with you but you have family all the same he grinned to himself not noticing he was still in the spotlight as many people still stared at him but he waved apologetically to the weasleys and went to sit with hermione and her family you know for a second there i thought you werentgoing to come said hermione grinning at harry you know for a second there i didntthink i was either but this is a time for family and as far as i know now you re it as far as it is now asked hermione which is as far as it ll be for a long time sighed harry sitting down next to hermione and her parents that good enough for me grinned hermione so you want me to be the secret keeper asked harry again it was late that night and most of the visitors to hogwarts had either taken to the rooms provided for them or had left harry was in mcgonagall office with the minister snape mcgonagall various muggles that harry assumed were important due to the slight snobbishness of their voices and at the doors mad eye moody yes potter said mcgonagall again they had been discussing many things about the wizarding world and how muggles were going to take it now that they knew of its existence harry had heard from mcgonagall that they had developed an extremely powerful spell over the past weeks to hide the magical world from all those that had no magical blood unfortunately including squibs also into the soul of one person much like the fidelius charm the muggles would still know in the back of their minds about the wizarding world but the people present in the room hoped the muggles would just dismiss it as a strange fantasy or daydream do i get a choice or anything what do you think we re giving you now snarled snape there then came a silence in which harry used to think whether or not he would want to keep such a secret no disrespect intended and i honored you chose me for this but i dontwant it said harry mcgonagall nodded very well potter we shall find someone else you may leave and remember not a word to anyone else save perhaps mr weasley and miss granger yes professor said harry leaving the room still trying to get his mind around the spell that would be the wizarding world protection from possible future problems with the muggles he walked out passing the great hall and to his alarm he saw it was almost midnight sprinting off he ran quickly to the head boy dorms and saying out the password he jumped inside ginny i sorry i late i was it okay harry said ginny in a strange voice i ll get the cloak shall i yeah you go do that accio invisibilty cloak said harry pointing his wand to his dorm as the silvery cloak zoomed into his arms he stared at ginny again so where are we going where else would we go for a private chat er here no ron or hermione might come down at any second we re going to the marauder room twilight evabandmamber13 chapter thirty twilight look i sorry said harry and ginny at the same time no you shouldntbe they said again okay you talk they said in unison this isntgoing to work is it muttered ginny under her breath flushing slightly as she realized she spoke aloud okay ginny you talk i ll listen ginny rolled her eyes okay harry the reason okay i sorry i i cantjustify what i did and i apologize for that my only reason is that when when fawkes dropped your body on the ground at the summit and the winds died down i thought i thought you were dead and it okay started harry but ginny waved her hand impatiently obviously wanting to finish when i thought when i thought you had died then i just wanted to my world just fell apart i wished i was dead with you i wished that i never failed you failed us by letting you leave harry remained silent at a loss for words and when you came back it just seemed like everything was being pulled back into place but it didntseem real and i was afraid i was scared harry scared that ginny sniffed loudly then bowed her head and when she continued it was in an ashamed soft whisper i was afraid to love you again i was afraid to chain myself to what might ve lead to more pain i was afraid that someone would take you away from me again i was a coward harry i what about now ginny asked harry almost shaking a silent question burning up in his heart what if she still feels the same and she wants to break up now said ginny laughing bitterly i couldntever stop loving you harry i never did from the first time i saw you in king cross and you asked my mum for instructions on how to get on to the platform i even thought you were quite cute and lonesome then she giggled a smile lighting up her face much to harry relief even in hogwarts after i gave up on you i still loved you as a friend as i got to know you and then i fell in love all over again she sighed harry didntknow how to respond so he just kept quiet look harry she started again her voice much more serious i tried to get over you i tried with all my might but i couldn t cause you complete me you re like the air i breathe you re like my other half please harry please forgive me for doing this harry finally let a grin come over his face already done ginny weasley as he pulled her into a tight hug a feeling he had missed deeply in the past few weeks he noticed again how ginny hair seemed to literally be alight different colors sparkling and shining you know gin he murmured half consciously your hair isntthe same as all of your family s ginny pulled away slightly arching an eyebrow it like a splash of different colors it like you have a bit of blonde in there said harry smirking like veela blonde almost or like malfoy blonde ginny pulled away entirely now are you asking for a kiss or a slap she said in a very false cross voice i dontrather fancy a handprint on my face said harry a smile tugging on his lips would you fancy something else on your face said ginny seriously her eyes dancing with amusement and she licked her lips are you saying what i think you re saying oh shut up she said starting to giggle furiously as harry started to move towards ginny he remembered how the shield of the founders used to play music for the marauders and he thought he might as well give it a shot cintrectra he said a small bit of rubber flying out of his wand and smacking the lion on the shield perfectly and a slow tune started playing from nowhere i swear that i can go on forever again please let me know that my one bad day will end i will go down as your lover your friend give me your lips and with one kiss we begin are you afraid of being alone cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of leaving tonight cause i am i lost without you i ll leave my room open till sunrise for you i ll keep my eyes patiently focused on you where are you now i can hear footsteps i dreaming and if you will keep me from waking to believe this are you afraid of being alone cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of leaving tonight cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of being alone cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of leaving tonight cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of being alone cause i am i lost without you are you afraid of leaving tonight cause i am i lost without you i lost without you i lost without you and as ginny stood up with harry and they swayed to the music he realized how true the lyrics of a song could be as he held ginny in his arms and he looked down into her hair and realized just how much she meant to him i lost without you and he knew would be without ginny there with him the days passed into weeks and the weeks turned to months and as august had come and almost gone graduation had come graduation had come the newts taken and for most passed as of this moment harry and hermione stood on a stage conjured in the great hall with the whole of the seventh year and their families there i give you miss hermione granger and mr harry potter head girl and head boy for hogwarts said professor mcgonagall dressed up in a dark blue robe for graduation day the crowd cheered loudly and harry could distinctly hear ron roar those are my best friends up there hermione walked forwards to the microphone harry at her side he as his custom had not prepared for the speech at hand and he was silently begging the gods to grant him inspiration at the last second so he didntlook like an idiot my friends and family started hermione hogwarts has been my home for seven years seven years of inspiration education adventure friendship and love it is with both anticipation and remorse that we graduate today and take our next steps into the wizarding world i myself as a muggle born have much to explore in the wizarding world as an adult and i certain that even those that grew up accustomed to magic will still feel the same but our time at hogwarts i shall never forget here i made my two best friends harry potter and ron weasley here i learnt loud snickers went through the crowd of students and a collective hissing came from their parents hermione grinned nervously as she continued here i learnt the values of friendship and love and it is here that i can appreciate my gift of being a magical person and i can thank heaven that this gift was given to me and i urge you all to never forget how lucky you are to have this gift yourselves she paused i thank you hogwarts and all of her staff and students for changing my life much for the better she nudged harry nervously as applause went up through the crowd harry numb with fear held the microphone up and smiled to the crowd nervously receiving several sighs and squeals of pleasure from some girls in the crowd both young and old and loud snickers from seamus dean neville and the weasleys er hermione grasped his hand under the booth hardly and not at all helpfully digging her longer than average nails into his skin ah he gasped before getting control of himself i can stand the cruciatus and not hermione pinching me but suddenly even as he stood rooted to the floor inspiration did indeed seem to flood through him possibly because of hermione impaling his skin possibly because he didntwant to look like an idiot or possibly because he saw ron elbow ginny in the crowd and whisper something in her ear i may have been made head boy but it was not for my intelligence or my efforts and certainly not my fondness for rules began harry too right exclaimed mcgonagall in a much too loud whisper she had the grace to look ashamed as a few people laughed in the crowd including fred and george who let out loud extremely fake guffaws and bowling over ginny who was sitting next to them in a fit of fake laughter harry grimaced slightly as he continued i was made head boy because professor dumbledore had faith in me he trusted me to do the right things to make the most of the opportunities given to me and try to make others do the same i believe he made me head boy to prepare me for things beyond life at hogwarts to give me a sense of responsibility and above all to show that he believed in me i thank you professor dumbldeore he said smiling up at the enchanted sky not caring whether or not anyone thought he was insane a respective silence came over the crowd which brings me to my message to all of you he continued when he deemed the time was right it isntthe just smartest the bravest the most hardworking nor the most cunning that can succeed i urge you all to remember this and remember that you can make a difference and you can succeed it is your choices that make you not your abilities and i hope to see all of your choices will lead you well in the future my classmates there was a silence in the hall still everyone gazing intently on him questioning whether or not his speech was over i wish to thank my friends my classmates and my professors for helping me along the first stretch of the road that is life for granting me support when i needed it and wisdom over the years so that i could make the right choices when i had to hogwarts was the first home i really ever had and in more ways than one i am sure i will always think of it as a home thank you hogwarts for everything you ve given me he stepped down from the microphone and walked with hermione off the stage muttering sorry for using your speech for inspiration as mcgonagall continued on to introduce the prefects including ron harry and hermione took a seat near the back a few rows behind the grangers who beamed back at hermione harry asked hermione suddenly yeah where are you going to live after hogwarts harry paused a new dread starting to come over him just seconds after the initial worry about his speech had dissipated i i never really thought about it probably the burrow for a while he said and then pressed hermione i dontknow you said harry d you want to rent a flat or something together in london or something after we get jobs or something we could be roomies she said enthusiastically roomies roommates harry honestly didntyou grow up with muggles since when do you use slang started harry but then he stopped himself that a great idea hermione we can poke around for an apartment somewhere after school over great grinned hermione what about ron he asked ron you cantexpect a girl to move in with her boyfriend straight out of school can you it moving too fast she said in an as a matter of fact tone what girl said harry grinning stupidly on purpose oh god harry said hermione exasperated hey it ron said harry pointing at the stage ni hao da jia wo jiu xiang shuo ji jiu hua is he speaking chinese squealed lavender doubling over in high pitched laughter and so he was fre d george ni men liang ge da zei wo hen si ni men wo zhua dao ni de shi hou wo jiu ba ni de tou ge kan diao fred and george laughed uproariously in the crowd giving each other high fives beaming at what looked suspiciously like a bar of chocolate in each of their hands mrs weasley smacked them both on the head and everyone in the crowd started laughing uproariously finite incantatem said mcgonagall in a waspish voice obviously not pleased with this disruption stupid gits i ll cut you open and stuff you until you re the size of milicent bulstrode roared ron who was in mid rant apparently not aware that the spell was taken off him and everyone including a very disapproving bulstrode family could hear him a very loud eh hem from mcgonagall snapped ron back to his senses er good luck everyone and have a nice life said ron sprinting off the stage for harry and hermione his face twisted in an expression of the purest loathing his face so red harry was surprised steam wasntcoming out of his ears yet stupid little started ron language ron snapped hermione i didnteven say anything yet you were going to was not was too guys said harry softly nervously looking at the stage you know you just go and assume hermione i wasntgoing to guys bellowed harry all eyes snapped towards them ernie macmillan who was on the stage with his mouth open and his arms hanging in the air stared at him blankly mcgonagall looked absolutely livid at the disruption er sorry called harry feeling stupid carry on like i was saying hermione started ron not you he hissed those two would never stop bickering thought harry it just wouldntbe the same if they did okay okay line up for the whole year photograph waved the bald photographer enthusiastically ron groaned next to harry they had been standing there for the past hour and a half wearing stuffy dress robes waiting for the others to finish their personal photographs after completing the house photographs okay gryffs here ravens here huffs here and snakes i mean slytherins here said the photographer moving a stubby arm with every house twenty minutes later they were walking up to their common room where they prepared for the graduation ball only open for seventh years and no dates from other years could be brought much to harry dismay hey ron he said as ron nervously smoothed the sleeves of his dress robes and raked his hair with his other hand what i not going said harry what repeated ron turning his head to look around at harry i going to go see hagrid one last time before we leave oh hagrid exclaimed ron how could we forget you guys go on to the ball god knows hermione been looking forward to it i ll send hagrid your regards said harry tell anyone that needs to know where i am sure mate have fun said harry and he still wearing his fancy dress robes walked down to hagrid hut for the last time as a student to see his friend and teacher the last night had passed far too quickly for the seventh years tastes and before they knew it their final moments at hogwarts had come many of them had already crowded in the great hall awaiting the signal from the professors telling them that their year was over and they could leave but harry ginny hermione and ron were still in the head boy and head girl dorm harry seemingly paralyzed it the last day he started hollowly c mon harry dontworry we can come back and visit it anytime we want this was the first home i ever had c mon mate we ll be late no you guys go first i just want a few more minutes go ron and hermione left the dorms lugging their trunks behind them ginny sighed and took a seat next to harry cuddling up to him and wrapping her arms around his chest it ll be alright harry hogwarts may have been your first home but it wontbe your last i dontknow if i can leave ginny why this was where i learnt i was more than just a punching bag for dudley i found out who i really was here hogwarts holds my roots gin she didntrespond just wrapped her arms around him gently and stared up into his face her wide brown eyes thoughtful and caring i i almost wish voldemort had never been destroyed said harry suddenly the war life in hogwarts this is all i have ever known i dontknow if i ll ever be the same away from it all dontsay that harry it true isntit gin this is who i am this is what i am all i really good for is defence against the dark arts you re not just some kind of war hero harry you re so much more you re a wonderful flyer you re a kind loving person and above all you re harry you re the one i love now come on harry come with me slowly he nodded and untangled himself from ginny and walked to his trunk we better go said harry the carriages will be leaving soon yeah c mon gin yes harry she said fumbling with her trunk thanks dontmention it and turning to the dorms one last time he nodded to himself and levitating his trunk into the air he opened the portrait hole and started running for the exit ginny beside him they just made it in time to reach a carriage where ron and hermione were waiting looking anxious goodbye hogwarts he said solemnly and as if on cue the thestrals started galloping come on hollered ron in what seemed to be a second later surprisingly they had already arrived at the platform and the students had already boarded the train the four of them being the last ones still on the platform running onto the train they journeyed up and down the train struggling to find a compartment in the end settling for one already holding luna and neville throwing down her trunk hermione plopped down next to luna come on she cried we can still see it harry leapt to the window soaking in the majestic beauty that was hogwarts castle which was slowly fading away until harry could just see a newly repaired divination tower and then as he blinked hogwarts disappeared behind a hill and he could see no more harry continued staring at the place where hogwarts had been hoping that the train would turn another corner and he could get another glimpse of it but it became clear to him after fifteen more minutes that it would not happen turning back to his friends he joined them in a game of exploding snap ignoring the feeling of sadness that started welling up in his soul so where are you going to live now neville asked ron an hour later coming back from the restroom oh i ll still live at my gran for a while until i get a job preferably at the ministry gran has this feeling as she says that i going to get a high rank one day mind you i did okay on my newts great uncle algie going to buy me a new broomstick ron snorted clapping neville on the back why where are you going to live asked neville looking around me and ginny are going to live at the burrow until we grow old and have white hair said ron proudly what he means is neville we re going to live at the burrow until we find jobs in his case that might just be until he old but i still have one more year at hogwarts and you guys said neville indicating hermione and harry we re going to go rent a flat or something said hermione vaguely we re said ron his attention snapping onto hermione me and harry said hermione didntwe tell you said harry frowning we re going to be broomies roomies harry but what about me asked ron looking outraged well as you said started harry you cantexpect a girl to move in with her boyfriend right out of school can you said hermione it moving far too fast girl what girl said ron hermione huffed glaring at ron and harry ron looking slightly disgruntled pulled ginny towards him slinging his arm around in her in a brotherly fashion and messing up her hair how bout it gin let go get a house in manchester or something eww you wiped mayonnaise all over my hair groaned ginny mayonnaise i didnthave any mayonnaise today well what else is white and slimy asked ginny i can think of a few things said harry and none of them are things you d want in your hair ginny suddenly grimaced urgh she bellowed you sick you urgh slapping ron hard on the face she announced that she was going to run her hair under the sink until she could be sure that the white stuff was gone you poor misguided boy said harry leaning back and helping himself to a pumpkin pasty what what ginny on about said ron clutching his face hermione flushed red giggling furiously harry struggled not to join her and ultimately failing as he broke out into laughter a few seconds later neville looked just as confused as ron and luna sang hot cross buns under her breath poor ron had no idea what had upset his sister so much so he turned back to his sandwich and exclaimed oh there is mayonnaise in this ginny ron harry hermione called the weasleys who were waiting for the four of them at the platform hermione had asked her parents to allow her to stay at the burrow for a few weeks until she and harry would find a flat to rent hi mum squealed ginny hello mrs weasley said harry and hermione hey ginny hollered fred and george how our little winky ginky gin ginny gin ginkiedums swallow a brain remover mint or something smirked ginny and smacked her brothers playfully you just saw me yesterday come on now let get off the platform and head home now shall we said mrs weasley ushering them off to the platform to where a car was parked hello all said mr weasley enthusiastically like our new car the ministry gave it to us as a reward for out contributions wonderful dad exclaimed ginny and her father hugged her happily what about me dad said ron wait on second thought never mind harry caught ginny eye and they laughed aloud as they got into the car and mr weasley drove away back to the burrow later on that day after they had finished their massive welcome home dinner harry and ginny sat outside in the backyard wordlessly staring as the sun slowly began its descent it not so bad now is it harry said ginny softly not bad at all he replied surprised at how as soon as those words came out of his mouth he knew them to be true harry thought back on the times he had spent over the past seven years in and out of hogwarts his thoughts were mostly scrambled until he settled on one distinct memory in the summer before the seventh year remember last summer in gringotts gin how could i forget that huge vault she said yawning widely no remember what you said to me ginny didntreply thinking hard her eyebrows furrowed in concentration you said i ll live and grow up happily i ll get married to a wonderful girl live my life have children watch them live their lives and even watch their children i didntbelieve you then so you believe me now said ginny softly as long as you re with me ginny he said painfully aware of how corny he sounded just to express his innermost thoughts she smiled at him and slid an arm around his waist that ll be forever harry i promise another memory suddenly flashed into harry mind and he sprung up suddenly causing ginny to jerk back frightened if you ever miss us harry look to the light and even as he thought that he looked to the bright skies and as the twilight filled the skies he could almost feel the spectral forms of his loved ones smile down upon him and maybe it was a trick of the light but as he started to turn away he could see what suspiciously looked like his mother face up in the skies smiling down at him gin look can you see he said pointing slightly unnerved see what harry said ginny slightly cautiously my never mind ginny he said finally understanding you think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us you think that we dontrecall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble your father is alive in you harry harry could see now that dumbledore had been right that one day not just his father but his mother sirius remus and even professor dumbledore himself would never truly leave him and then for the first time in his life he was truly complete as he knew all his loved ones were there with him that day gin he said a smile creeping up on his face mmhmm she murmured thanks for everything i love you ginny he said suddenly and even as her eyes lit up with shock and delight he bent down and kissed her softly but with passion like he had never kissed her before and was never going to kiss her again until a loud voice coming from the porch broke them apart just like during the summer ginny come in mum needs your help with the pies hollered percy bossy voice ginny let out a low frustrated growl i better go she said i love you too harry and with her cheeks flushed and a wide grin on her face she walked into the house harry looked to her retreating form and then turned back to the skies once more where the sun was now almost set he could see clearer than before the spectral forms of his loved ones in the skies even though he knew they were not really there he could see his best friends hermione and ron bickering beside a window probably about something small as usual he could see his pet mysticat fortuna bounce playfully in the garden with crookshanks both batting at what looked suspiciously like a garden gnome he could see mr weasley fred george percy bill and charlie at the kitchen table poring over a large piece of parchment over the table and he could see mrs weasley and ginny by the kitchen window chopping up apples as ginny saw him outside she smiled and waved him in and harry smiled walking back into the burrow to friendship to love to a home and to a family the last rays of twilight shining upon him the end twilight evabandmamber13 chapter three phoenix in action diagon alley under siege remus fainted the house was in an uproar harry had yelled for the weasleys and the grangers who were trying the best they could to heal remus harry tried to use floo powder to get to hogwarts but it was blocked harry was desperate he needed to contact dumbledore just when he was about to floo to hogsmeade then run up to hogwarts fawkes dumbledore phoenix appeared it must ve sensed that an order member was in distress and came to see what was going on harry quickly scribbled a note to dumbledore prof remus hurt diagon alley under siege hurry hp the phoenix took the letter from harry hand and erupted in flames returning to dumbledore arthur bill charlie percy fred and george weasley immediately flooed to diagon alley to join the aurors already there molly weasley with the help of hermione and ginny was healing remus who had been hit in the chest with an arrow charm the arrow had already been taken out they were cleaning the wound and resealing it remus lay there out cold harry and ron were left there standing useless to anyone frustrated harry decided he had enough motioning to ron he walked to the fireplace threw a handful of floo powder into the flames and yelled diagon alley as usual harry felt like he was being sucked down a giant plughole spinning around he finally came out of the fireplace at the other end of diagon alley dusting off his robes harry did not wait for ron as he kicked the door to the abandoned leaky cauldron open and flew out into the streets it was absolute chaos harry had often wondered what a massive wizard war would look like and it seemed like he was getting a small sample of it now aurors and ministry members held the eastern side of diagon alley whilst dark wizards were taking over from the western side harry thought that diagon alley had looked bad a few days ago but now it was horrible the once smooth pavement was now smashed and shops were burning down harry saw six redheaded men sending jets of light simultaneously towards the dark wizards and harry rushed to join them crying out impedimenta as soon as he reached the front lines of the battle no one had time to tell harry off for being there everyone was too busy sending off curses harry barely noticed that ron had come up behind them stupefy roared the weasley men and harry five out of the eight curses thrown found their target avada kedavra screamed the dark wizards back six aurors fell dead flipendo yelled bill and charlie weasley two dark wizards one of them a death eater flew backwards crashing into the apothecary landing in barrels of frogspawn harry ran into the fray yelling stunning spells until a jet of silver light hit him harry crumpled hit by a knockout spell the next thing he heard was a wizard yell ennervate and he snapped awake he tested all body parts everything seemed to be okay harry jumped up and immediately returned to his position next to the weasleys harry saw in the midst of the dark wizards ranks a pale blonde boy whose mask had fallen off draco malfoy avada kedavra yelled draco an auror collapsed dead harry had had enough conjunctivitus harry roared draco clutched at his eyes harry knew his curse had hit its target draco malfoy would not be seeing anything anytime soon maybe not for the rest of his life with a hideous shriek draco fell to the floor his wand snapping harry satisfied turned around and launched a series of curses expelliarmus stupefy impedimenta diffindo unfortunately for harry the only curse that met it target was the severing curse and all it managed to do was severely embarrass lucius malfoy as his more private body parts were shown when the severing charm ripped his robes open ron let out a groan man i did not need to see that harry as harry flashed ron a grin a cold sense of foreboding shook harry only one thing could do that dementors they came pouring into diagon alley making many of the aurors and ministry officials fall trembling as the worst experiences of their lives started to replay themselves it became apparent to harry that not many people could make a patronus here five or six clouds of misty grey flew out of wands half heartedly dark wizards were advancing harry whipped out his wand thought of a world where he could live happily ever after with his friends a world free of voldemort where all the people he loved were alive and happy and bellowed expecto patronum the silver stag erupted out of his wand furiously repelling the dementors attacking in a pure animalistic rage it was not enough however one stag could not overcome a hundred dementors all the people that could still move ran harry potter stood alone watching his patronus beat back dementors he yelled multiplicus serpensortia fifteen giant cobras flew out of his wand harry hissed attack it was no use eventually the dementors and the dark wizards had pushed to within ten feet of harry all seemed to be lost as the wizards of the light trembled before the dementors when albus dumbledore appeared with fawkes by his side expecto patronum roared dumbledore and five phoenixes flew out of his wand assisting the lone stag it seemed that dumbledore arrival and fawkes phoenix song spurred on the aurors as they stormed into action sending off multiple hexes as the dementors were pushed back by the patroni the curses hit the dark wizards dark wizards that had not been hit shook in fear harry had read about how the phoenix song had different effects on different people and he saw it visibly now aurors charged headfirst whilst death eaters and other dark wizards ran away seeing that their battle was lost the dark wizards grabbed their associates and apparated out the dementors had no such luck between dumbledore and harry patroni the dementors were soon forced into a tight circle what do we do with them asked harry there was no mercy in dumbledore voice as he said vanquish them but professor isntit i dontknow how to for a response harry saw dumbledore draw himself up to his full height and bellow maximus vanquisho in a flash of pure white light the dementors let out an otherworldly wail and were no more harry studied his headmaster eyes there was no mercy no twinkle of benevolence there was blue fire hate for the dementors harry now fully understood why dumbledore was pronounced as the greatest wizard in the world you shouldnthave come harry dumbledore sighed pocketing his wand harry said nothing but observed the damage done to diagon alley shops were smoking and the once smooth street was blasted to bits it would take a long time to fix many wizards including the weasleys were running around casting extinguishing spells it is a good thing that you did though if you had not then the dementors would have overrun the ministry wizards and diagon alley would be under the control of voldemort he didnteven manage to take it during the first war you and ronald have proven yourselves today you are worthy of being in the order harry still stood wordlessly i must go sort things out with the ministry please return to hq and stay there until september 1st draco malfoy sir will he be punished for his involvement with the dark wizards and casting the killing curse asked harry finally speaking up draco malfoy will be expelled and probably sent to azkaban we have captured draco we have eyewitnesses that he used the killing curse he was writhing on the ground when we found him clutching his eyes for some reason when we caught him but his father apparently escaped our clutches i afraid i must leave harry there are a lot of things to sort out with that dumbledore apparated away the weasleys and harry returned to grimmauld place dirtied tired and bloodied mrs weasley had immediately shrieked at ron and harry for leaving so abruptly but calmed down when mr weasley told mrs weasley on how harry had saved the day and how ron had saved harry so that who revived me thought harry and mrs weasley was beaming hermione and ginny were not as easily swayed we stay here being mediwizards and you two witness a real wizard battle professor binns had just asked for an essay on the most recent battle for holiday work you two have a full account now it not fair exclaimed hermione her complaints revolving around schoolwork as usual ginny reaction was strange she drew harry aside and with a hurt expression in her eyes asked very nicely why didntyou bring me hermione and mrs weasley needed you there gin remus was hurt pretty badly rubbish i wasntdoing anything and you know it ginny dontginny me tell me why you automatically ask ron to go with you is it because he your better friend is it because he male some kind of sexist thing are you afraid little ginny going to snap like a twig if she enters one little duel remember you re not the only person that survived voldemort i not absolutely hopeless colin sure treats me like an equal why cantyou i thought we were a team harry the four of us luna and neville you re right i sorry harry said emotionlessly and walked off why was she so emotional about this was she jealous of ron strange he harry didntgive half a thought to it just motioned to ron because it was natural it wasntas if he had insulted her or anything she was busy helping to heal remus and why did she have to mention colin deciding that he would never understand girls harry took a shower then shut himself in his room promptly falling asleep and not waking up until dinner it was not until he woke up did he realize that ginny words almost mirrored his own a few years ago the next morning the daily prophet arrived battle of diagon alley defeat of dark forces dark wizards and witches alike assaulted diagon alley yesterday ministry officials and aurors held diagon alley strong but were steadily being pushed backwards as they were outnumbered rumors say that remus lupin ex professor werewolf at hogwarts had ran out of battle clutching a bleeding hole in his chest and flooed away alerting albus dumbledore somehow harry potter received this news along with fellow student ronald weasley they charged into battle when the dementors of azkaban came it was harry potter yet again that saved many lives with an unbelievably powerful patronus he held back the dementors long enough for albus dumbledore to arrive on to the scene and save the day once again we as citizens of the wizarding world must thank harry potter however harry potter alone did not win the battle as his fellow student revived him when a knockout spell cast by one dark witch or wizard unknown hit him causing him to fall into the middle of the battle unconscious needless to say had he been left there he would ve been killed let us raise out glasses to the boy who lived and the boy who saved him this article was written by rita skeeter for a detailed description of the battle and background information about harry potter and ronald weasley turn to page 8 for information on all aurors and ministry representatives present turn to pages 9 and 10 well that new skeeter actually saying something positive good job hermione harry said folding the paper and giving it to ron returning to his meal harry did not notice two girls looking very left out leave the kitchen the final weeks of the summer vacation passed quickly and before harry knew it it was time to say goodbye to the weasleys and grimmauld place packing his trunk harry hermione ron and ginny portkeyed to king cross station making their way to platform 9 the four friends met up with luna lovegood neville longbottom and colin creevey along with dennis who tagged along behind his brother harry saw colin greet ginny with a kiss and a few whispered words that made ginny turn red harry suddenly had a strong feeling of hate for the boy that held him in such high regards since when had colin changed anyways looking away from ginny and colin he saw neville and luna holding hands walking to the invisible barrier and disappearing neville and luna harry never saw that coming walking towards the barrier ron and hermione were half heartedly striking up a conversation with little dennis creevey at least something looks normal thought harry wow for once they all forgot about the boy who lived thought harry as he walked through the barrier alone harry went to the prefects compartments up front and was greeted by professor dumbledore himself harry waited until hermione had come and sat down next to him reckon we ll have to make a speech mione honestly harry arentyou ever going to read hogwarts a history of course we have to i ve been spending the last week making up a speech but i didntknow could you make a joint speech with me sure if you want to talk about how the famous boy who lived is suitable to be head girl hermione smirked urgh dumbledore stood harry noticed that the room was now full of prefects welcome prefects i wontkeep you long as i sure you all want to catch up with your friends i present to you your head boy and head girl harry potter and hermione granger who will go over your responsibilities as head boy and head girl you will listen to them as you would me said dumbledore and portkeying back to hogwarts probably to prepare for the arrival hermione stood dragging harry up with her prefects of hogwarts started hermione it was a very long and very dull speech harry had switched his mind to thinking about quidditch when hermione slapped him on the arm what harry whispered i done its your turn harry straightened up i no good with speeches like hermione here there were sniggers in the crowd at this i just want to inform say that you prefects will be vital to the security of the school we will rely on your honesty and ability your task will be to stop dangerous deeds and to be a role model to younger students ron yawned loudly in the crowd and received a death glare from harry in return anyway good luck and dontlet us down dismissed harry watched as people filed out of the compartment until it was just harry hermione ron ginny colin and luna there harry watched spitefully as ginny cuddled up to colin did she not remember what happened this summer nothing did happen this summer though it just you that thinks so said the pesky voice whatever harry did think he wanted to grab colin stupid camera and stuff it down his throat but that would look conspicuous now wasntthe time for an internal battle harry decided and joined the conversation hermione speech nearly killed us could you have made that speech any longer said ron well at least i covered what needed to be covered which is more than i could say for someone replied hermione scathingly sending a look in harry direction well it wouldntdo me any good to repeat what you said now would it said harry yeah that and because you dontknow anything about the duties of a prefect laughed ron true true hermione smacked harry playfully which in turn he fell over playfully crushing hermione feet under his elbow hermione yelped and ron rolled his eyes exploding snap anyone harry watched hagrid and the first years get into little boats for the traditional trip to hogwarts by the lake whilst harry hermione ron and ginny shared a warm carriage pulled by thestrals it had become a very chilly night and the four friends were thankful that they didnthave to go on those tiny boats where it would be freezing there it is yelled ginny hogwarts one of the only places where harry felt at home over the years he had gotten to know and love every corridor at hogwarts yet he often found new surprises the castle of hogwarts was purely magical a n pardon the pun couldntthink of anything else harry led the way into the castle where they all sat down at the gryffindor table and awaited the arrival of the first years come on come on groaned ron clutching at his stomach harry smiled some things would never change the first years led by professor mcgonagall walked through the doors to the great hall harry noticed that there were a lot more foreign students than he was used to seeing hermione who had obviously been thinking the same thing whispered with dumbledore and you here parents obviously think this is the safest place to be which it probably is conversation was pulled to a stop as the sorting ceremony began the sorting hat finished its song harry counted the new students there were 16 new gryffindors 24 new hufflepuffs 20 new ravenclaws and just 2 new slytherins dumbledore looked worried the two slytherins were welcomed warmly at their table but received glares from everyone else in the hall dumbledore stood and the hall fell silent welcome students to another year at hogwarts as you all know the wizarding world is in chaos yet we must not allow that to control us or lord voldemort gasps and a shriek from a 2nd year hufflepuff were heard dumbledore cleared his throat and continued or lord voldemort has already won quidditch and trips to hogsmeade will be continued but for safety purposes only fifth years and above may visit hogsmeade this year we have a new club at hogwarts inspired by an underground club founded by our current head boy and head girl this year alastor moody will teach a select few the arts of dueling both with wands and with swords you know who you are already as your letters would have told you to buy the necessary equipment now before i let you all fill your stomachs as i sure you re all desperate to do our caretaker mr filch has added another two hundred and four items that are forbidden in hogwarts you may see the list outside his office harry ron and ginny sniggered fred and george have been doing well eh now tuck in said dumbledore with a twinkle in his eye as masses of food appeared in front of the students and staff after a massive feast harry and hermione bid good bye to ron ginny neville and colin and went to the head boy and head girl dorms where a portrait of a bearded man asked password err hermione do you know honestly beauty rest the portrait swung open and harry entered harry first reaction was wow their shared common room was about half the size of the gryffindor common room with a large sofa in front of the fireplace and two desks which were labeled h j potter and h a granger harry laughed hermione you never told me your initials were hag hermione turned crimson and said well which room do you want the common room linked to two staircases supposedly to each person room harry took the left staircase and went up to his room there was a private bathroom linking to the room and a drawer for his clothes and trunk harry forgot that he lent hermione his book on curses which he planned to read a bit before going to bed so he went up to her dormitory when harry knocked on the door lightly and received no response he opened the door a crack harry chuckled lightly to himself inside was his best friend hermione polishing her head girl badge fervently like he had seen percy do four years ago twilight evabandmamber13 chapter five godric hollow harry woke up the next day puzzled at seeing a blanket on him hermione must ve put it on me he thought i ll have to remember to thank her harry said aloud thank me for what harry said hermione who was taking a bread roll out of the picnic basket the house elves had left for the blanket what blanket you didntput the blanket on me no must ve been a house elf oh okay here have a roll hermione tossed a butter roll at harry we ve got about twenty minutes left so hurry up and eat so we can go i haventpacked yet what i haventpacked yet harry ran from the room stuffing the whole butter roll into his mouth harry threw things into a day bag three sets of robes one set of casual clothes and his invisibility cloak harry thought better safe than sorry harry slung the bag over his shoulder and ran down to meet hermione who was already next to the portrait hole come on we re going to be late harry and hermione sprinted out of the portrait hole to dumbledore office hermione paused at the gargoyles oh no we dontknow the password honestly hermione said harry in a perfect imitation of hermione licorice stick licorice disgusting harry and hermione knocked on dumbledore office door come in they heard professor sorry we re late said hermione breathlessly oh not at all how was your breakfast satisfactory i hope oh yes it was delicious all i had was a roll hermione elbowed harry in the chest dumbledore laughed well that wontfill a growing man stomach will it with a wave of his wand dumbledore conjured up a plate of sandwiches eat up whilst i explain the theory behind the time travel charm hermione cast harry a disapproving look as he started shoveling sandwiches into his mouth the time travel charm is to allow one essence spirit if you will to enter the fourth dimension and fly backwards hence traveling backwards in time wizards have honed this charm to allow a person to choose exactly when and where they want to go with certain limitations of course i have further developed the charm to take our bodies back the incantation is tempus rewindo followed by your stated time and destination wand movement is a full circle going anti clockwise remember that you must not go clockwise or your body will be transported into the future whilst your mind goes to the past or so my theory says needless to say it would be very hard to reunite your body and spirit when they re in different timelines making it impossible for you to do any counterspells now practice the wand movement follow my demonstration dumbledore swung his wand around in a circle then flicked when he reached the starting point of the circle red smoke stayed in place where dumbledore wand had traced through the air harry and hermione did as they were told but it was a couple of times before dumbledore was satisfied with their wand movements good now put your wands down and practice the incantation tempus rewindo december 1979 godric hollow said harry and hermione as one harry shot hermione a curious glance you want to go meet my parents too of course i do and its better if we stick together anyway right so we have our destination planned already i see okay before we go we will need a method to convince lily and james that we are not hostile and we are who we claim to be the easiest way to do this is the memory duplication charm which shouldntbe too hard for you to master the incantation is memoirtransverto you may practice now harry wasntcertain he wanted to do this hermione looked equally nervous well i ll go first then memoirtransverto said hermione harry saw hermione life flash before him memories as a little child licking ice cream and playing jump rope to a nervous eleven year old placing the sorting hat on her head to a frightened girl as they went down the trapdoor to retrieve the philosopher stone to the cold emptiness of being petrified to the fright of dementors and riding a hippogriff in third year and the joy of helping harry free his godfather harry grimaced hermione crushes now flashed through his mind victor krum and ron blissfully the crushes ended and harry saw the whole fight at the department of mysteries through hermione eyes feeling her own admiration for his ability to think under conditions like that then was the sixth year hermione year with ron harry shut his mind at that and said yeah it worked my turn i suppose memoirtransverto hermione eyes glazed slowly tears began welling up in her eyes hermione then winced a great many times until a big knowing smile appeared on her face only to be wiped out again oh harry hermione hugged him harry was uncomfortable he could not think of any words to say so he gave a pleading look to dumbledore over hermione head eh hem i know it is trying to experience harry life in such a short period of time but we really must get going on our field trip before the rest of the school gets up our bodies should only disappear for one minute but it would be hard to explain if someone saw so on the count of three then harry and hermione picked up their wands one harry checked his watch it read 8 19 two harry thought of ginny and how he had left things with her at a bad note harry stiffened knowing he wouldntsee her again for another month well at least he could think of ways to get back on her good side whilst he was away three three voices yelled tempus rewindo december 1979 godric hollow the sensation was strange harry felt a jerk from all directions making him feel rather stretched out and then his mind spun around and around and around until he landed face first into a red and gold carpet harry felt hermione next to him and he saw dumbledore boots next to his face how did the headmaster never fall over when using strange forms of travel harry heard his voice lily run they ve found us i ll head them off james potter ran into the living room and sent out a flurry of stunning spells dumbledore produced a shield out of thin air without an incantation which absorbed all of james stunners dumbledore uttered james in disbelief who are those two people and why is one of them disguised as me are these death eaters you captured harry and hermione stood up dumbledore said i should hope not james as these two are head boy and girl at hogwarts in the year 1997 more importantly that boy is not disguised as you he is your son james laughed now come on albus seriously who are they my name is harry james potter it a pleasure to finally meet you dad said harry looking his father in the eye harry felt like he was looking into a mirror only james potter eyes were brown and he did not have a scar oh my god you re not joking are you albus he has my looks and lily eyes but wait how did these two come to our time with a lot of research and a bit of my help they are here to learn james you came from the future too asked james disbelieving dad can i transfer some memories to you to show you asked harry almost timidly if you hear me saying anything else other than memoirtransverto you may stun or kill me whichever you wish james potter nodded but kept his wand up harry waved his wand and said softly memoirtransverto james potter stood quietly at first until his body had begun shaking violently when he looked up he was fully convinced oh oh my god me and lily died you grew up with those pathetic muggles stuttered james and you went through all of that without a family damn peter i did gain a substitute family though the best i could ask for the weasleys hermione hagrid remus and and sirius in response james yelled lily come here you ll never believe this lily potter walked into the room she had shoulder length dark red hair and almond shaped emerald green eyes harry smiled at the sight of his mother she was just as people described her beautiful james what is going on oh hello albus who are those two said lily potter very fast lily that is our son the one you re just pregnant with right now that his best friend hermione granger and that albus 18 years later those three have just come here by a time travel charm clearly lily potter was not convinced whipping out her wand she yelled finite incantatem nothing happened harry hermione and albus stayed exactly the same way they did james potter looked like he was about to laugh and lily potter turned bright red lily let harry share his memories with you you ll understand then no way am i letting some random stranger who is probably a death eater perform a spell on me no matter how much he looks like you james yelled lily still brandishing her wand mum i honestly hope you have better thoughts towards your own son than to think he a death eater said harry lily potter met her son eyes and saw no hint at a lie fine do your spell memoirtransverto lily reaction was almost exactly the same as james at the end of it however lily potter was in tears she looked down at her yet to be born son and the seventeen year old standing before her i sorry that we let you down harry whispered lily lily ran and gave harry a hug wordlessly harry smiled at the fact that for the first time in his life that he could remember his own mother hugged him hermione albus and james watched on with a smile on their faces until james walked to his son and wife and joined them in their happiness so why are you three here asked james and lily the next morning over platefuls of eggs and ham the wizarding world in our time is darkening again voldemort has risen for the second time and his influence is rapidly spreading you know of the prophecy i trust well harry will need some training up and who better to train him than one of the top aurors and the most brilliant charms inventor the world has seen for many years oh stop it albus you re making me blush said james sarcastically batting his eyelashes everyone roared with laughter but seriously wontthis training mess up the timelines or something no james we are currently in a separate timeline created just for the use of us when we return to our timelines we will be the only ones who have any memory of this period of time however should we choose to return again you will remember us the way we are in the real timelines you are currently eating breakfast with lily by yourselves going off to work later on and returning home late at night in this timeline you can do whatever you wish you see the current time line does not really exist time travel is a very complex thing and i ll be glad to explain it later james should you have forty or so hours to spare okay i got it we re supposed to train my son and his best friend to be aurors more or less that the idea your main task is just to teach harry and hermione here as many tricks as you can i sure you two have learnt some during the war so far james and lily nodded but said we can have some time with harry alone though right of course i suggest daytime for lessons and nighttime for talking i myself have a few people i must visit i will return in a few days said dumbledore who then apparated away okay then what exactly do you two already know hermione was now in her element mainly defence spells and a few attack spells like flipendo and reducto okay how about we start on training tomorrow and we just talk for today i d really like to get to know my son seeing as we wontlive to watch him grow up how about you two tell us some stories said lily the rest of the morning was spent lounging about in the living room of godric hollow a warm comfortable place harry and hermione had just been describing vividly how they helped sirius escape when sirius himself popped his head in through the fire hi lily james do you two mind terribly if i pop on over for lunch wormtail is out and i cantbe bothered to cook something up lily rolled her eyes and said yes sure sirius we have some company though promise me that you wontdo anything stupid when you see them we ll explain when you get here a few seconds later sirius rolled out of the fireplace with a cheery smile hello lily hello james hello james what sirius stared at harry harry potter nice to meet you harry stood up and shook sirius hand of course i have met you before but that a whole different timeline harry swelled with happiness seeing his godfather once more after the situation had been described to a disbelieving sirius they had lunch at diagon alley harry observed that although voldemort was nearly peaking in his power the people at diagon alley walked around without a fear obviously this place was a haven harry and hermione had a nice day out with lily james and sirius returning late at night after going to several shops and buying unique artifacts that would ridiculously expensive once harry and hermione returned to their own time harry bought himself a silver chess set a gold set for ron a delicate looking watch for ginny and a book that had been outlawed after voldemort defeat in their own timeline deadly curses and hexes defence by attack by scott marlowe which was true to its name containing many extremely dangerous spells that little did harry know would soon need to be used and not for practice either harry may we have a word with you before you go to bed sure harry said i ll see you later hermione harry followed lily down into the kitchen where james already sat at the table harry when you transferred some of your memories i could tell that something is bothering you something that isntrelated to your mother and i dying nor sirius dying do you want to tell us what it is asked james we could help i dontthink so dad it a girl problem said harry sadly who better to ask than me then james asked with a smirk fine well i suppose it started really in my second year when i went to visit my friend ron weasley at the burrow and his little sister ginny had a crush on me harry had felt much better after he let it out of his system he had raged at colin creevey and described ginny in such vivid detail that he was surprised james and lily had sat there wordlessly listening to him and had not fallen asleep in the end they said that he had no choice but to let the situation sort itself out harry wasntreally expecting any advice but he was all too happy to let his frustration out of his system harry was surprised to find that he slept much better and he was fully rejuvenated when he awoke the next morning come on harry we have classes squealed hermione in delight harry sprung out of bed but then groaned do you think i ll have to call my parents professors potter and potter i d be horrified and insulted if you did son james said looking into the room come on down when you re ready harry and hermione walked down the stairs lured by the smell of lily cooking after a hearty breakfast harry and hermione had their first lesson with james and lily today we learn about different types of destruction curses the simplest is the destructo incantation which shatters a simple item like a vase destructo said james a vase broke into a thousand little pieces reparo said lily the pieces twisted and turned and reformed into a whole vase again this spell by itself isntvery useful at all unless you need to break something that you couldntdo with your hands what you will need to learn is the bone crusher spell the incantation is skelestructo when the spell hits a certain area of the body any bones in that place a shattered into a fine bone powder and then absorbed into the blood there is no counter curse to this the only way bones can be regrown is through a new invention skele gro that unpleasant stuff i tried it back in my second year did you how did it feel asked james curiously it was pretty painful i mean it like you re drinking liquid bone and its spreading through you excuse me potter men we were in the middle of something here snapped lily yes professor potter it wonthappen again miss chorused harry and james who then gave each other high fives and laughed lily and hermione rolled their eyes and hermione said honestly harry we re trying to learn here yes that the head girl talking muttered harry so that only james could hear him anyway if you hit someone in the head with this you could imagine what would happen all four people grimaced days flew quickly by with learning exquisite and often dangerous spells in the daytime and sitting in the cozy living room at nighttime hermione had now gotten very comfortable with harry parents and was constantly chatting to lily harry was in total bliss almost he was certainly very happy the past few weeks spent with his parents were heaven all harry ever really wanted but deep down harry knew it wasntreal despite his joy in spending time with his parents he missed ginny horribly and wished he could ve left her with a happier note one night the final night before harry hermione and dumbledore would be taken back to hogwarts james drew harry aside once more harry it has been wonderful to meet you and knowing that when you go back we will never be there lily and i have filled a pensieve with our memories so you can be with us even if we cantbe with you james took out a smaller version of the pensieves that harry had seen before it fit into the palm of his hand james handed it to harry harry took it with a nod and pocketed it also i have some advice to you about your girl i believe that you needed some advice harry nodded but thought to himself didnthe already give me advice couldntdo this with lily around cause i d never hear the end of it if she found out well did you know that me and your mother never got along until the seventh year yes really how snape pensieve and information from sirius right anyway i always had a little bit of a thing for lily and i tended to be err more of a showoff around her i thought that was the best way to impress her by being cool well harry do not try that i wasted about 4 years doing that it was when i gave up on my crush and acted normal that she finally fell for me oh padfoot never let me hear the end of that one but dad it different with me i already missed my chance with ginny harry you dontunderstand yet give it a bit of time and you ll find that you ve fallen for her and fallen hard my point is this when you realize that be nonchalant but be sweet to her be there for her if she gets hurt and your patience will pay off not in the history of the potter house has a potter male lost his true love harry smirked at that but said thanks dad i ll keep that in mind okay you and hermione go to bed or something i ve got something i need to talk about with your mum harry nodded and grabbed hermione saying mum dad wants to see you come on hermione when the two had reached their bedroom on the second floor hermione and harry slumped into their respective beds what did james want harry to give some fatherly advice to me hermione smirked ginny she asked harry nodded and hermione let it drop you know harry i ve been having some weird thoughts lately oh yeah asked harry sleepily only moderately interested yeah must be the whole one month of separation thing but i think i ve got that crush on ron again harry snapped awake what oh i dontknow

smiled hermione i dontmind if you and ron get back together honest i want you two to be happy and if that makes you two happy then who am i to stop it hermione yawned and said harry you can be the sweetest thing you know i hope ginny realizes what she missing soon or someone going to come and snatch you up harry turned red he took his wand and whispered nox totalus goodnight hermione goodnight harry twilight evabandmamber13 chapter six of duels and death eaters harry and hermione were packed ready to leave dumbledore had just apparated to godric hollow and alerted them that they had fifteen minutes before they were taken back harry could you come here asked lily this was the part that harry had been dreading more than anything saying goodbye to his parents would be the most painful thing he d ever have to do a muggle saying flew into harry mind as he walked numbly towards his mother better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all only now did harry realize the truth in it despite the fact that it was not romantic love he was glad that he had spent this month with lily and james james lily and harry potter stood wordless none of them could think of anything to say finally the three of them locked in a tight embrace that lasted several minutes harry sniffed lily we want you to know said james also looking like he was struggling to control his emotions we re proud of you son more than you could imagine do not be scared and do not be sad when you return to your time harry the future of the wizarding world lies with you show voldemort what it means to be a potter said james lily whose tears were now sliding rapidly down her face stuck an envelope in harry pocket read it when you need us harry harry lost it for the first time he could remember he cried cried in joy of finally getting to know his parents cried in pain for losing them again again lily had locked her son in a hug bad time asked sirius who was standing a few feet away from them i wanted to say good bye to harry harry finally had the chance to say good bye to his beloved godfather something had been stuck inside harry for more than a year sirius thank you for everything i never got a chance to say goodbye at the department of mysteries i ll miss you just as much as i miss my parents harry couldnttake it anymore he walked slowly away from his parents and godfather one minute harry called dumbledore voice harry we love you said lily and james together sirius nodded and said that goes for me too goodbye harry goodbye mum dad sirius i love you all too and with a jerk lily and james potter along with sirius black were no more harry collapsed in dumbledore office tears running down his face the grandfather clock in dumbledore office read 8 20 hermione had pulled harry into a hug awkwardly and dumbledore just looked on by lunchtime harry had calmed down there was no evidence to show that he had been crying except his now slightly red eyes harry obviously had not given much thought to the fact that in real life only a minute had passed seeing a disgruntled ron and ginny next to him harry ran towards them and pulled them both in a hug saying i missed you two so much harry remembered too late that ginny wasnthappy with him err right harry you just missed one history class it wasntthat long apart said ron looking at harry as if he was slightly insane why did you skive off history anyway have you been crying harry your eyes look awfully red said ginny ha the famous harry potter was crying oh my god i need to get a picture of this one said colin creevey sod off creevey take your camera somewhere else no wait my camera broke when i last took a picture of you capturing you in its lens must ve caused it to burn up go away you slimy git you know what i know why malfoy always hated you now you just strut around all day colin was stopped there as his teeth and chinbone disappeared and the bottom half of his face slumped harry pocketing his wand said i told you to sod off creevey go run to the hospital wing before you do something stupid and make me mad again colin fled clutching his face with his left arm harry caught a bit of black as colin lifted his arm up a bit too high harry also noticed too late that colin eyes had a deadened look in them harry gasped it was the dark mark that was uncalled for harry yelled ginny ginny he a death it was no use ginny tore after colin leaving harry very miserable indeed did you see what i thought i saw harry asked ron the dark mark colin said harry hermione and ron at the same time but what about his eyes they looked deadened like the imperious curse pondered harry i have to see professor dumbledore continued harry no we have care now you can see him afterwards harry grumbled but followed ron and hermione as they trudged off to a session of care of magical creatures hagrid had not changed one bit still as loud and as big as ever the only difference was that there were lines of worry on the half giant face hey hagrid greeted harry enthusiastically all righ there harry ron hermione all right they responded as the rest of the gryffindors and the slytherins appeared hagrid began his class i ve got a real treat for you seventh years this project will last your entire year and count for your n e w t s there are fourteen eggs in here one for each of you in there are seven different species your task for the whole year is to let your animal hatch and to raise it you may keep the creatures as pets when you graduate or you can give them back to the school there will not be any classes but i ll be here if you have any questions said hagrid line up to pick up your egg everyone ran into a line no one wanted to be left with one of the two sinister looking black eggs that were shaking violently harry was about sixth in line and he picked a small egg with a red and gold pattern it felt warm in harry hands immediately he felt glad that he had chose the egg it had an aura of warmth around it with that the seventh years left hagrid hut harry looked at hermione and ron eggs hermione was a brown egg with specks of blue and ron was a plain gold colored egg hermione immediately went to the library to check on different types of egg and hopefully to find out which species hers was harry went to dumbledore office only to find that he wasntthere harry left a note with fawkes professor dumbledore urgent discovery can i see you after professor moody class harry and ron sat down at gryffindor table in the great hall to plan out their quidditch strategy for the year and who to ask to join the team ginny was to try out for chaser for sure but she was the only person that was definitely trying out the gryffindor team was composed of harry ron and two beaters called andrew kirke and jack sloper for now and they would hold tryouts tomorrow evening ron why is ginny going out with that creep creevey asked harry out of the blue after an hour of discussion i dontknow colin wasntthat bad a guy until recently since when do you care who ginny dates anyway asked ron suspiciously ron you know why sweet merlin harry why now why couldntyou have done this two years ago i was stupid alright ron harry sighed is this irony or what my sister pines after harry potter for god knows how long ever since mum read her the story of how you conquered the dark lord she tries to get you to notice her for more than three years at hogwarts and about two years later you reverse roles i knew it i knew it you re trying to steal my girlfriend nice to see you got your teeth and chin bones back creevey are you coming to lose them again snarled harry what going on here asked ginny who had just come up behind colin potter here was discussing with your very own brother how to steal you away from me pronounced colin harry stood as he was more than a head taller than colin this was an impressive move we discussed no such thing liar spat colin i dontlie you worthless death eater better a death eater than a liar and a coward like you who a coward you if you arentprove it i challenge you to a wizard duel at midnight inside the dark forest meet outside hagrid hut you re on death eater my second is ron who your second ginny although i dontneed a second to beat you two ginny wouldntbe your second would you ginny said ron there was a long pause as three pairs of eyes burned into ginny fiery green ice blue and mud brown ginny said has it occurred to any you that i might not want a part in this at all ginny ran and colin soon followed her harry stared a hole into colin retreating back you dontmind backing me do you ron mind asked ron incredulously i wouldntmiss you kick that little death eater arse for anything well not unless you were kicking malfoy arse speaking of malfoy has he been sent to azkaban yeah dad told me last week the problem is there nothing guarding azkaban anymore the dementors have all sided with voldemort all that stopping all the criminals in europe from escaping is a vast ocean and an anti disapparation jinx it was with a dark mood that harry ron and hermione went down to moody sword dueling class after dinner today topic is dueling the in form of fencing the sport of fencing developed out of the formalized sword duel the duel of honor which first became prevalent in the early 16th century may have had roots in both the single combats of the medieval tournament and in the notion of trial by combat which dated to norman times the weapon most commonly associated with early dueling the rapier also originated in the 16th century the rapier had a narrower blade than the medieval broadsword and was optimized for thrusting attacks although it could also be cut with contrary to popular conception rapiers are not any lighter than broadswords as they tend to be very long and usually require the wielder to have some additional device like a small shield or parrying dagger in the off hand to use for defence with changes in technique and fashion the swords were essentially gentlemen sidearms worn as much for style and status as for defence the rapier was gradually lightened and shortened into the smallsword of the 18th and 19th centuries the smallsword was quick enough to be used for both attacking and parrying eliminating the need for a separate parrying device the fighting styles developed for the smallsword are the direct ancestors of modern fencing techniques killing in a duel had long been outlawed by the beginning of the 1800 s and by the 1820 the wearing of swords had passed out of fashion fencing was moving into the realm of sport sport fencing was originally done only with the foil the blunted practice sword used to teach the basics of swordsmanship in the second half of the century the lightweight dueling saber gained acceptance as a sporting weapon the practice of duelling continued to be found through the late 19th century and into the early 20th century though by this time duels were rarely fought to the death the thrusting sword often used in these duels was heavier and stiffer than a foil and the nature of the weapon and the duel required a somewhat different set of techniques and tactics than used in bouts with the foil this weapon eventually became standardized into the fencing epee lectured moody however a fencing epee is not a weapon one would use in a real swordfight so we will start off by learning with the real killing sword the longsword of course your swords should be blunted and an impact absorbing charm shall be placed on each of you before you duel colin looked particularly nasty at this comment now get into partners and we ll see how you can do without instruction growled moody ron grabbed hermione and smiled at harry tough luck mate harry turned to ginny at the same time as colin gin harry asked come on sweetheart dontbother with famous potter ginny found herself torn again but this time she made a choice harry eyes pleaded with her and she snapped out of something as if harry look broke a charm that colin had on her ginny walked to harry and said come on harry grinned like a cheshire cat and whispered thanks gin colin shot harry a murderous glare all the more reason to kill you tonight he hissed you treacherous excuse for a human being weasley consider our relationship over and done with you chose potter now you have to accept the consequences said colin raising his voice harry grabbed colin by the collar and smashed him against a wall threaten ginny again and you wonteven have time to dread the consequences you ll be dead like this harry snapped his fingers ten points from gryffindor potter let that boy down harry walked over to moody look through his shirt at his left arm moody turned around looked and gasped that a dark mark boy i going to go see dumbledore immediately end this lesson for me potter dontdo anything stupid damn i should ve looked through every student i never thought creevey would be initiated he a muggle born never thought voldemort would want one of them never in all of his history has he initiated a muggle born witch or wizard but that it who would suspect a muggle born with that moody swore and hobbled out at an amazing speed everyone lesson is canceled go back to your dorms hermione ginny ron come here for a second everyone filed out besides for colin who had a shrewd look on his face funny i dontremember your name being hermione ginny or ron oh dontworry i dontwant to breathe in the air that you pollute with your presence any longer than i have to just seeing if you decided to chicken out on our wizard duel or not it not every day i get a chance to kick death eater arse creevey i ll be there the question is will you be there colin nodded once with a sick look of satisfaction on his face and left hermione ginny one of you should come under the invisibility cloak to call for help in case this is a trap it not big enough to fit both of you enough so you can run if you need to ron stay in hagrid hut with hagrid use his fire to call dumbledore if there something wrong i going stated ginny plus hermione cantbe caught out she head girl think what that would look like but what about harry he head boy spluttered hermione since when have rules applied to harry smirked ron i going under the cloak hermione you can stay with ron if it makes you feel any better harry who would you rather have go asked hermione pulling harry into a trap i dontcare flip a coin what asked ron and ginny it a muggle way of deciding who gets something there are two sides to each coin each person chooses a side and whichever side faces up after flipping the coin into the air and landing wins got a coin mione in response hermione took out a sickle from her pocket flipped it and called out heads the coin span around and around and landed on tails damn ginny you win you go with harry ginny smiled damn i good at this harry plan was set in motion when ron under the invisibility cloak ran to hagrid house harry just saw ron and hermione materialize and give the thumbs up sign through the omnioculars when he grabbed his wand and said accio invisibility cloak harry didntsee it until it smacked him right in the face handing it to ginny they made their way down to hagrid hut halfway there ginny said quietly harry i sorry about the whole thing with colin and err i want you to know that i a loud crack stopped them both in their tracks decided to show up huh potter creevey come on we re going deep into the forest where your second i decided that i dontneed one i dontplan on dying today funny thing is potter i agree with you i dontplan on dying today either harry and colin now stood in the clearing that hagrid giant brother grawp had made during harry fifth year strangely none of the creatures that inhabited the forest had been seen or heard by harry so far harry felt a pair of lips through his invisibility cloak graze his cheek and a voice whisper good luck harry hoped ginny had enough sense to stay out of the way so now we duel from a bird eye view a tall black haired boy and a short brown haired boy could be seen circling around holding their wands in attack position ready to strike on the count of three potter three two colin bellowed crucio harry fell to the floor letting out one shout in agony white hot knives pierced every bit of his skin harry wished for death so he could see his parents and sirius again but then he remembered a certain redheaded girl standing invisible probably silently screaming at the sight of her friend on the floor yelling filled with emotion the boy who lived did something that had never been done before he stood up and shook the cruciatus curse off rage was burning in his eyes again you filthy little maggot figures a death eater would cheat on a duel of honor it was my fault i suppose that i forgot that you lost all your honor when you joined voldemort creevey diffindo yelled harry show your master disgusting little tattoo colin left sleeve was severed from his robe and harry saw the dark mark on his skinny upper arm enough of this potter avada kedavra colin roared harry rolled out of the way and yelled skeledestructo totalus his spell went a bit to the left and missed colin good mudblood you served your purpose a new voice said lift the imperious curse son let potter see whom he really been arguing with we can put it back on later this mudblood may be of some use yet harry glared at the intruders and then at colin colin creevey looked puzzled then horrified and then he slumped to the floor as a voice yelled stupefy harry swore well potter i guess its me that gets the pleasure of delivering you to the dark lord i told you that you chose the wrong side potter on our first train trip to hogwarts remember that potter it was draco malfoy who was bent over colin creevey apparently examining any traces of injury that meant that the other death eater was lucius malfoy harry found himself outnumbered two to one he remembered ginny was in the area and tried to think of some way he could communicate with her he thought of the communication charm but he remembered that he had to at least know the location where ginny was at when he felt a hand prod him well he had the location now before you think of doing something hopelessly heroic and stupid remember that there are two of us and just one of you if you even start the incantation to stun one of us the other one of us will kill you oh how we ve all waited for this day to finally come the great harry potter fails at last gloated malfoy senior harry whispered barely moving his lips inteltransverto ginny can you hear me if yes tap me on the shoulder once harry felt a tap ginny at the count of three stun the malfoy on the left dontsettle for one stunner shoot as many as you can better safe than sorry i ll get the one on the right tap me again when you re ready immediately harry felt another tap one are you listening potter it not very polite to ignore your captors two enough of this come here now potter drop your wand on the floor where you are now draco malfoy who had just stood up and looked behind harry and gasped audibly father there someone behind potter now stupefy roared harry and ginny ten times in succession there was no need though the first two hit their targets the malfoys with no time to react fell to the floor thanks gin now come on help me get these three up to the castle and just to be safe harry walked over and took all three of their wands before saying mobilicorpus harry and ginny ran out of the forest with the floating bodies of malfoy malfoy and creevey in front of them ron hermione hagrid yelled harry the three sprinted out of hagrid hut but not before dumbledore had reached them to harry surprise he was absolutely livid what do you think you were doing you could ve been killed harry you should ve came straight to me roared dumbledore professor dumbledore i wasntaware of any of this creevey challenged me to a midnight duel and did it not occur to you even after spending a month with the one of the best aurors of the century that it might be a trap yes it did that why i had ginny come under the invisibility cloak dumbledore now calmed down and sighed harry you must not keep risking your life like this one day you might not be lucky enough to come out alive i know but this was something i had to do for personal reasons i understand harry now let us try to get some information out of these three i have an idea everyone turned towards harry place a memory charm on the malfoys so they can report back to voldemort with bad information but colin colin was under the imperious curse they wontneed him anymore so he ll have to be kept safe yes yes what type of trap to set though hmm pondered dumbledore professor what is my punishment for being out of grounds and persuading others to join me dumbledore sighed again no punishment harry you did a good deed tonight just dontkeep pushing your luck any further now go back to the head boy and head girl dorms for tonight good night harry walked back up to the castle silently with hermione ron and ginny in tow stinking malfoy cried ginny when they had gone through the portrait hole i so stupid this is all my fault i should ve known that colin would never have acted that way towards me what way asked ron and harry simultaneously jolting out of their reverie he wasnt colin he was sweet romantic comforting it wasntnatural how could i not have seen ginny slumped to the floor gin everything is alright now colin will be protected here at school and they ll deal with the malfoys you dontunderstand harry it my fault i didntsee its my fault that colin suffered a whole year under the curse it my fault he has the dark mark now ginny harry voice was hard now remember your first year how you suffered the whole year under the influence of voldemort do you blame me for not figuring it out until it was too late do you think it my fault no of course not dontbe silly but then colin wontblame you and this isntyour fault either even moody didntnotice colin stop blaming yourself it not your fault you dontunderstand i was practically a death eater girlfriend for a year harry opened his mouth but found that no words came out despite himself harry felt jealous of colin harry stood up apparently to go up to his dorm but turned around and instead of voicing the question he dreaded to hear the answer to he asked remember when i blamed myself for things that happened in the past ginny nodded slowly i needed some time to let it go to mull it over eventually learn acceptance and self forgiveness so time is what i ll give you but when you re ready you know you can talk to me good night ginny said harry softly pulling her into a hug then walking away harry caught her eye once more seeing endless emotion in those deep brown orbs and walked up the stairs to his room meanwhile severus please administer the veritaserum to these two severus snape walked to the motionless forms of draco and lucius malfoy and placed three drops of the clear liquid each of their mouths ennervate what are your names questioned dumbledore immediately lucius malfoy said the blonde on the right draco malfoy said the other one in a toneless voice dumbledore noticed that both of draco eyes were magic rolling eyes someone must ve ruined his real eyes with a conjunctivitis curse how did you two escape from azkaban our master freed us a week ago by breaking into azkaban how why and when was colin creevey put under the imperious curse and initiated into the ranks of the death eaters filthy mudblood wouldnthave been suspected our lord had a plan to watch potter all year observe his social life to find a weakness and strike creevey was also to watch the muggle lover dumbledore draco put the imperious curse on creevey a year ago when he sent him a note supposedly from potter to meet him down at the quidditch field draco and lucius malfoy continued tonelessly when was voldemort planning to attack mr potter i dontknow what instructions have been given to creevey to spy on potter and observe dumbledore and to cause trouble for potter any way possible the mudblood was supposed to get into fights with potter at any small excuse what has colin creevey found out and reported potter has feelings for the weasley girl dumbledore looked shocked for a moment but then said what is voldemort going to do with this information kidnap the girl and use her as bait if he could not get potter tonight what was your plan tonight a stupid smile came over draco face our lord sent us to collect potter from creevey at midnight under a ruse of it being a wizard duel creevey was to lead potter deep into the forest where me and my father were waiting why were there not more death eaters awaiting our master said that our presence must not be revealed until the plan has been executed why didntyou just stun mr potter and take him asked dumbledore curiously potter ruined my life i wanted him to suffer and be humiliated before we took him to the dark lord where is the dark lord now london england in knockturn alley what are his plans nothing at the moment just waiting for the opportunity to strike at potter or dumbledore dumbledore nodded thank you draco lucius that will be all severus snape nodded obliviate twilight evabandmamber13 sorry i haventupdated in awhile i ve been really busy so i decided to post a few chapters well here you go chapter seven the halloween ball all right you three get into the air andrew jack whack bludgers at them when i give the signal yelled harry it was the quidditch tryouts and twelve hopeful students came to exhibit their skills ginny weasley seamus finnigan and neville longbottom were up neville had greatly improved over the years and now looked like he could fly all right but he was still way behind the standards that harry and ron had expected from the tryouts in fact only ginny and seamus had managed to put any goals past ron so far the rest of the people trying out were there was no other way to put it absolutely hopeless since colin had been released from the imperious curse his attitude and skills had returned to normal he no longer was the self confident and annoying person harry grew to hate but the timid now even paranoid boy that had always followed harry around colin had lost all of the imperious gained power that came from malfoy and when he came to try out not surprisingly he could barely fly in a straight line in harry and ron opinion ginny seamus and neville were the best three so they teamed them up to see how well they d fare against ron ginny riding fred or george cleansweep seven outstripped seamus and neville by a considerable amount as they were still on the old school brooms the shooting stars ginny seamus and neville streaked towards ron tossing the quaffle from one person to another trying to bait ron into concentrating on one person eventually seamus tossed the quaffle high into the air which was grabbed by a speeding ginny who spun around a bludger and threw it backhanded into the left hoop just a split second before ron long arms reached out over the exact spot where the spinning quaffle had been ginny seamus and neville were doing a celebratory lap around the field harry noticed despite himself how ginny hair flew behind her a curtain of red whipping through the air her weasley inherited flaming red hair flying behind her blending perfectly with her black hogwarts school robes people trying out were not given the gryffindor quidditch robes until they were accepted into the team harry was snapped out of his daze by a bludger that almost took his head and ron voice oi harry what are you doing harry immediately turned on his firebolt and streaked down towards ron needless to say he felt like an idiot for staring at ginny weasley when he should have been observing their plays more carefully well what do you think who the best so far asked ron ginny one hundred percent no competition replied harry looking at ginny who was now flying in formation with neville and seamus yeah i agree with you on that but who should the other two be seamus and neville i guess they work pretty well as a team already okay then oi gin seamus nev come here everyone else dismissed yelled ron bit crude dontyou think ron congratulations you re on the team practice on saturday morning at five said harry with a smirk when they had come over five in the morning cried neville oh dontbe such a baby nev laughed seamus giving neville a shove this wasntthe smartest thing to do neville already in shock was in no condition to hang on to his broomstick he fell harry and ginny swore and simultaneously bolted downwards towards neville harry firebolt outstripped ginny cleansweep and before long he had caught up to neville grabbed his hand and swung him onto his broomstick neville let out a cry of pain as his entire body weight was grabbed through his hand causing a sharp pain in his wrist the two combined weights slowed the firebolt down by a lot but harry quickly brought neville down neville looked petrified but other than that he was unharmed dammit seamus cried neville you scared the magic out of me seamus was caught between laughing uproariously and apologizing profusely and ended up just spluttering then collapsing in a laughing fit harry suddenly realized something that he hadntnoticed for six years about ginny weasley he harry of course came diving down right after neville it was his very instinct or as voldemort would say his love for playing the hero but what he didntsuspect was that ginny just came streaking down right at the same time as him somehow he had never thought of ginny as the heroic type and immediately admonished himself for it harry suddenly had a feeling of admiration for ginny character not just for the subtle beauty on the outside but for the very noticeable beauty on the inside ron was patting neville on the back awkwardly jack and andrew were laughing with seamus ginny was staring right back at him with an eyebrow raised and a mischievous smile lit on her face harry snapped out of yet another trance and with a smile at ginny they went to go help ron with neville who was still wide eyed and pale the new gryffindor quidditch team walked up to the great hall for dinner life at hogwarts had returned to the norm besides for the fact that harry was now doing satisfactory in potions and when teamed with hermione they could last ten minutes in a duel against dumbledore before the old wizard got the better of them harry was glad to see that ginny had returned to normal besides for being slightly ashamed of herself for not noticing colin unconsciously she had severed her connection with colin as they no longer shared a common room and she tended to work with other people during class harry was unashamedly glad that colin had left ginny alone harry now had taken to walking around at all time with the red and gold egg either under his arm or in his bag as it started to shake by itself every once in a while despite looking in many books harry could not find what he was looking for harry found that parvati had also had the same egg any idea on what it is he had asked a few weeks ago at dinner in the great hall harry was surprised that instead of getting a straight answer he found parvati flirting with him outrageously asking him if he really wanted to know the answer or just wanted to talk to her this drew a lot of attention from ron at that point his face turned red and he buried himself in one of hermione books and when parvati had finally left ron grabbed harry led him away from his steaming bowl of soup outside the hall and cornered him do you like my sister or not if you do you better stop flirting with parvati if you know what good for you ron yelled spit flying all over the place actually ron if you didntnotice it was just parvati well you sure looked like you enjoyed it i have half a mind to go tell ginny now tell me what hi harry tell me what harry was uncomfortably reminded of a situation that had arose in the summer before his fourth year at the burrow when mr weasley had been telling fred and george off for giving dudley a ton tongue toffee despite himself looking at the expression on ginny face caused harry to roar with laughter collapsing against ron who shook him off tell me what ron said ginny now starting to look dangerous nothing ginny just err nothing gin ron just being an arse cause parvati was flirting with me harry laughed again ginny paused then asked and ron finds this a way of threatening you by saying he ll tell me why is that harry stopped laughing immediately then the words that came out of ron mouth made harry want to disappear cause he supposedly likes you ginny what you heard me he has something for you if you know what i mean i caught him writing a poem about a beautiful red haired girl when we were in history hmm who could that have been ron said pulling a face but then again you cantblame harry can you sitting through binns lectures awake is an accomplishment to be proud of said ginny with a smile harry was puzzled there was no trace at all of the shy girl who was taken into the chamber of secrets in his second year harry has the hots for you and you have nothing to say harry had gone to a shade of deep red at this but to his surprise ginny was nonchalant he has fine taste she had said and then walked off to dinner nothing had been said about this topic since then and harry had taken to admiring ginny from a distance watching her help first years with difficult charms watching her fly around the quidditch pitch at night time and sharing nights talking about classes dueling and quidditch in the head boy and girl common room ron and ginny had moved in a few days after colin creevey had been released from the curse harry observed that colin had pulled away from everyone besides his own little brother dennis despite the fact that harry knew that colin was under the imperious curse and he did not blame him one bit for it harry and his friends no longer felt normal in his presence colin had dropped out of moody classes and unfortunately no one could say they really missed him what bothered harry more was his situation with ginny they had continued on as best friends but harry often wondered if ginny took ron seriously and if she did why this topic was never brought up but tonight was not a night to have any doubts about his situation with ginny harry stood waiting nervously in his own dorm it was one day after dumbledore had announced a halloween ball and three people had already approached ginny probably for a date to the ball but before any could say anything a pained look from the boy who lived the symbol of the wizarding world as he watched the boys walk up to ginny from a short distance behind her was enough to make them change their minds make up some excuse to talk to ginny then walk away almost immediately harry realized and appreciated the fact that others were giving him a chance and also knew that he shouldntpush his luck he had asked ginny to come up to his room after dinner on the friday before the ball so he could ask her something in private harry heard voices outside the portrait hole and a few seconds later ginny and hermione came into the portrait hole giggling madly hi harry guess what just happened ron asked hermione to the ball oh yeah hermione that twenty galleons you owe me now harry was delighted for hermione remembering how she said she might have some feelings left for ron during their one month trip to godric hollow what did you say asked harry unnecessarily oh harry you re so adorably na ve of course she said yes hermione beamed like ginny had just announced hermione as queen of the world oh i just remembered did you want to ask me something hermione covered her mouth at this but was unable to hide her giggles i ll leave you two alone for this shall i no dontbother i sure harry wontmind you overhearing whatever he has to ask hermione collapsed in a fit of giggles now positively writhing on the couch now that attractive said ron who had just come in through the portrait hole what going on harry was going to ask a question replied ginny prodding harry err hermione ron do you have to turn furiously red and cover your mouths while i do this ginny was still painfully confused or at least acted like it hermione and ron didntmove purposely not taking harry hint all right all right ginny will you go to the ball with me ginny gasped apparently she didntexpect that damn stuttered harry it okay if you don t i mean i just you know wondered i mean he been wondering ever since the beginning of year said hermione to ron in a very audible whisper struggling to hold back even more giggles ginny still stood wordless making harry feel very uncomfortable indeed i ll treat you to a day at hogsmeade anything you want to do on me said harry in an attempt to lighten up the assumption that a refusal was about to come his way harry flashed ginny a smile well since you put it that way sure ginny pecked him on the cheek and returned his smile our little ginny all grown up and turned into a a scarlet woman yelled ron and he had collapsed into a fit of laughter and you potter i knew you had it in you good going continued ron once he broke out of his most recent laughing fit he frowned no wait that doesntsound right i complimenting you on getting a date with my sister on second thought you better watch yourself potter at this hermione grabbed ron and pulled him into her room loud roars of laughter could be heard alas why does the world enjoy me make a fool of myself so much pondered harry because you re so much cuter when you re embarrassed said ginny you re you re you re one to talk how does that make any sense ginny giggled harry couldntbear it anymore he joined in with the laughter hermione and ron heard harry laughing realizing it was safe again to come out the rest of the evening was spent light heartedly playing chess and exploding snap until hermione looked at her watch and said oh my god it four in the morning the four friends went to bed and didntwake up until noon the following saturday two boys woke up and greeted each other unenthusiastically walking to the shared bathroom between them and starting to brush their teeth both boys remembered something at the same time with toothpaste foam in their mouths turned around at each other and exclaimed quidditch practice oh no obviously this wasntthe smartest thing to do apart from swallowing a bit of toothpaste harry now had bits of foam on his hair looking ridiculously like mousse that hasntbe applied properly and ron chin had gained a small foam beard ugh yelled both boys after spitting out the toothpaste and rinsing gin we forgot about quidditch practice yelled ron and harry a sleepy redhead and a bushy haired girl came out of their room moaning what are you on about yawned ginny quidditch practice it a saturday moaned ron ron let it go no use crying over spilt pumpkin juice they re going to tease us they ll say we were doing stuff in our little private dorms ugh oh well what will come will come c mon let get dressed and go to breakfast err lunch meet you down here in five gin mione you obviously dontknow much about girls if you expect us to be ready in five minutes harry said hermione fine hag be down here in fifteen said harry smirking at hermione hag questioned ron and ginny looking at harry for a second wondering why he had just insulted hermione dontyou dare tell them harold james potter of course not my dear hermione anne granger harry let out a loud fake sneeze that sounded like hag choo oh nasty hag i mean bug going around harry ran up to his dorm hearing laughter below and hermione yell potter harry heard ron exclaim when did mcgonagall get in here followed by a loud hmph and even more laughter when everyone was finally ready to go which was about half an hour later they found the great hall practically empty lunch was drawing to a close whilst harry ladled what remained of the tomato soup into his bowl and picked up a sausage roll luna lovegood approached them with neville in tow hello haventseen you four for a long time i was just wondering do you all want to go to hogsmeade next week after the ball you know to catch up actually ginny giggled harry promised me a date we can meet up with you four later though hermione blushed well seeing as you and harry are running off ron has promised me something similar too hermione i thought you two were over exclaimed harry in mock surprise okay well i guess that just a day for us then nevvie shall we go to madam puddifoot s harry snorted out loud he honestly could not imagine luna lovegood going into the little teashop which was a haven for couples that needed a good long snog without getting interrupted he had been there with cho parvati and lavender neville and luna gave harry a slightly peeved look whilst he saw ron fighting to keep a straight face sorry harry said way too late as luna and neville walked away next time then they called after them harry suddenly remembered something last year at the christmas ball he had seen many couples exchange gifts before attending and parvati had been quite upset when he showed up empty handed harry would not let that happen this time around with ginny although he knew that she wouldntreally mind if he showed up with nothing she was far too kind a person plus she had gone with neville once and colin the second time neither were particularly gentlemanly and neither of them could dance nevertheless harry knew it was time to get his dad invisibility cloak out again ron come here harry hissed as they walked out of the great hall i need to go buy ginny a gift for the ball would you mind covering for me i most certainly would i haventgotten hermione a present though and quite inconveniently i haventgot a galleon to spend harry sighed fine we ll make an excuse saying we re going somewhere secret to go plan out a quidditch strategy or something we can both fit under the invisibility cloak to get to the witch hump and in right reckon so hang on i ll go make the excuses thankfully hermione and ginny didntsuspect anything just rolling their eyes and saying in an exasperated voice boys with that harry and ron sprinted to the head boy dorm grabbed harry cloak and slowly made their way to the witch hump where the passageway to hogsmeade was an hour time had passed when harry and ron had come out of honeydukes and walked into the main street here ron take fifty galleons that should be enough to cover anything that you ll need fifty galleons said ron shocked at harry generosity but i couldn t i harry didnthave time for ron customary weasley trait of declining to accept money fine give it back then all the better i can spend more on ginny ron didntaccept that i didntreally just joking ron take the money and go harry and ron split ways there harry going to the jewelry store ron headed into surprisingly a bookstore harry laughed to himself ron was hopeless what would he find in a bookstore for a present harry was greeted by a short bored looking man who drawled sonny you might want to go to the store next door our stock is probably a bit beyond your price range i have one thousand galleons at my disposal to purchase a special gift for a special girl more if i need it i suppose you take gringotts checks the man snapped awake and peered at harry suspiciously and said very quickly bless my soul harry potter harry potter visiting my store oh i all of a dither tell me which lucky girl is going to get a gift oh pardon me i dontmean to intrude i was just curious harry was reminded of dobby the house elf and hermione granger well i looking for something special can i see your special necklaces it was the day before the ball just after dinner and harry still hadntfound out what ron had bought for hermione only to find that he spent twenty three galleons on the present harry suddenly wondered if his own gift was too much honestly ron you went to a bookshop to buy a present dontask what it is and i ll give your galleons back no keep the galleons and tell me what you got her you owe me that replied harry fine i went into the bookshop because i needed to read up some things about girl make up things like that you know i ended up getting her a book about make up and a box full of cosmetics harry groaned oh bad move weasley she not going to like that it going to be suggesting that you dontlike her the way she is you want her to wear makeup but bill and charlie always said to get a girl something she can use for the date harry said fine give it to her then maybe she ll find it thoughtful ron smiled and went to find hermione he did not return until an hour later you were right i had to explain everything but everything turned out okay where gin harry pointed out the window at a lone figure circling the quidditch pitch you know what i going to go join her leave you and hermione alone for a while without waiting for a response harry ran up the stairs took out his firebolt opened the window and sped out of it he sped towards ginny and scared her by suddenly popping up in front of her hey gin mind if i fly with you for a while not at all there wasntanything special about the flight with ginny but harry was perfectly content to just slowly circle the quidditch field together having a nice long conversation until it turned dark when they couldntsee anything anymore they flew down and returned to the dorms walking hand in hand the night of the halloween ball had come harry and ron stood waiting in the small common room waiting for their dates both stood calmly showing no signs of the fretting that took place beforehand ron ginny going to hate it dontyou think come off it you spent six hundred galleons on that there no way she wontappreciate it but look harry my sister isntone of those girls who chooses her men by how much they give her donteven talk about it never mind i fine harry and ron had then walked down in their new dress robes harry in a dark green color and ron in royal blue harry had waged an hour long war against his hair but eventually gave up even sleekeazy hair potion had no effect they stood there waiting for more than fifteen minutes when the two girls came down the head girl staircase harry and ron both let out a sigh of satisfaction hermione was dressed up similarly to all the previous balls in light blue dress robes and her hair tied up in a knot at the top of her head ginny on the other hand looked like an angel her flaming red hair which was usually slightly longer than shoulder length and pulled into a ponytail was let free harry noticed how they looked perfect on her silver white dress robes harry took out his gift here ginny i got this for you from hogsmeade harry opened the box revealing a white gold harry now tended to avoid silver in case he came in contact with remus who reaction to silver as a werewolf was fatal necklace elegantly crafted with a single jewel at the front the necklace was just wide enough for comfort around the neck however ginny could not see a way to put it on as it was still small she was about to ask about this when harry said it magically put on would you like me to put it on you ginny nodded with a wave of his wand the necklace found itself around ginny neck ginny looked at herself in the big mirror along the wall of their common room for the first time in her own life ginny weasley approved of the way she looked harry necklace seemed to finish her attire you look beautiful ginny thank you harry for the compliment and the necklace it beautiful it must ve cost you what it cost doesntmatter all that matters is you look absolutely gorgeous tonight and i the luckiest bloke alive to be your date harry held out his hand which ginny took to the ball then ladies and gentlemen harry asked in a false pompous tone to the ball they echoed and made their way down to the great hall when harry ginny ron and hermione had reached the great hall they found it already full of people who were happily chatting at tables that seated about six people and some had already started ordering their dinner over here they heard a voice call it was neville sitting with luna they joined them at the table the six of them talked for fifteen minutes until dumbledore stood up and announced the beginning of the halloween feast each individual table had their own buffet like selection of foods which ron and harry had liberal amounts of after some pumpkin pie dumbledore with a wave of his hand cleared all the tables and called out for the dancing to begin the first song was played by the famous group the weird sisters a fast paced song which the girls had immediately pulled their dates to dance to harry found that attending the ball with ginny was somewhat different to attending with parvati or lavender as he had done in the previous two balls harry no longer felt an absolute need to impress his date he felt comfortable enough twirling ginny around when the first song was over harry and ron made movements to go sit back down but were held captive by ginny and hermione ron had muttered under his breath slave driver when hermione had pulled him by the collar of his robes harry could tell he didntmind harry found that he certain did not mind either as he revolved slowly with ginny looking into her eyes he didnteven notice that the song was over until ron tapped him and said come on let go get drinks harry and ron pushed to the bar which was already packed with students getting butterbeers and pumpkin juice finally ron and harry returned to the table with six butterbeers passing them around cheers said neville five voices echoed him and they drank to a night of fun harry and ginny had left the great hall after the twelfth song had been played for a walk around the lake they walked hand in hand but in silence as they observed the calm beauty of hogwarts ginny shivered do you want to go back up to the castle ginny nodded and they returned to the castle not to the great hall but back to the dorms so started harry thank you for tonight it was lovely said ginny i sure i mean i was the lucky one ginny moved closer looking harry in the eyes and whispered teasingly i would ve gone with you even if you didntpromise a date at hogsmeade harry had absolutely no idea what to say to that so he kept silent ginny edged in even closer harry could see his own reflection in her brown eyes by now harry bent forwards and pulled ginny into a long passionate kiss sensations exploded inside harry it wasntlike kissing cho kissing parvati or lavender it wasnttinged with melancholy like cho kisses were it wasntpure undiluted passion like parvati and it wasntawkward like lavender kisses were there was no way to describe ginny kiss besides that they were exactly on the line between passion and love harry let himself go completely lost in ginny embrace ginny was the one who finally broke apart good night harry thank you for a wonderful evening she whispered and with a final hug she went up the stairs to the head girl dorms harry went up to bed in a daze lying awake replaying the memory of the kiss again and again and again until he had fallen asleep late in the night he never heard ron come up twilight twilight evabandmamber13 chapter eight down in the marauder room it was three weeks after the halloween ball and the morning of the second quidditch game of the season gryffindor vs hufflepuff after slytherin had crushed ravenclaw 250 to 10 i cantdo it said neville at breakfast his face white as a ghost you ll have to go without me use colin or someone no one listened to him they were all dealing with their own nerves besides for harry ron and ginny who were perfectly nonchalant nev come on snap out of it it hufflepuff come on said harry harry take hufflepuff seriously finch fletchley will keep you on your toes and abbot bones and macmillan are the best chasers hufflepuff has seen for a long time that comment made neville even more nervous and he flat out refused to eat anything when it was time to start the gryffindor team all felt at least a bit nervous grasping their new brooms the chasers mounted neville and seamus had gotten a nimbus 2001 each but ginny was still using fred cleansweep so harry had ordered her a nimbus x shock the new broom that was especially designed for chasers madame hooch whistle blew and the teams flew out onto the pitch the crowd roared as dean thomas began the commentary and here comes the returning champions the gryffindors here they come captain potter co captain weasley chasers weasley finnigan longbottom and beaters kirke and sloper the gryffindor crowd roared whilst the ravenclaw crowd applauded politely the hufflepuff and slytherin crowds booed and hissed and here comes the newly assembled hufflepuff team captain finch fletchley keeper blake chasers abbot bones macmillan beaters johnson and johnson both teams circled around the field once and then took their positions captains shake hands yelled madame hooch harry and ron approached justin and shook his hand briefly before returning to their positions hooch let out the bludgers and the snitch and picked up the quaffle as she threw the bludger into the air ginny quickly grabbed the quaffle and zoomed off towards the hufflepuff end of the field harry quickly started to fly around the pitch looking for the snitch while listening to dean commentary weasley passes to longbottom who zooms along the side ouch that gotta hurt neville had been smashed in the shoulder with a bludger nev are you okay hollered harry as he zoomed closer to neville neville nodded and returned to the gryffindor end to help with the defence harry returned to his spot high above the game looking for a sign of the snitch excellent save there by weasley and he throws it to ginny weasley who spikes it and scores the gryffindor crowd roared in delight after half an hour when gryffindor was leading 140 to 40 harry decided it was time to give justin a scare there goes potter he seen the snitch a collective gasp was heard around the stands harry with a small glance backwards saw that justin was tailing him he sped down towards the ground as fast as he could until he was just a few meters away from being crushed then pulled out of the dive with all of his strength and sped away his firebolt was the only reason that he managed to survive the dive harry heard a crunching sound and two loud snaps that meant justin was not as lucky justin screamed bloody murder a roar of anger arose from the hufflepuffs in the stand harry sped away looking for the snitch whilst hooch sped down to examine justin it turned out that he had broken his neck and captain finch fletchley goes off the pitch with a neck injury looks nasty good wrongski feint there by captain potter as the hufflepuff team is now down a seeker harry decided to call a time out what the matter asked ron justin out so we have time to burn if we want to catch the snitch what i suggesting is i act as a surrogate chaser i break their formations and i break through their gaps in their defence so its like we get one more chaser the rules say that neither the seeker nor the beaters are allowed to score but that the only limitation i can pass to any of you as long as the goal doesntcome directly from me if we win by more than 240 points we ll be in first place for the quidditch cup we can afford to push our lead hufflepuff are out of the running unless they actually have more than 150 points advantage which they definitely wontget with our splendid keeper ron and our superb chasers so agreed agreed echoed all the members okay let show hufflepuff why gryffindor is the best at hooch whistle the gryffindor team and the shorthanded hufflepuff team rose to the air again harry flew side by side with neville and seamus with ginny behind them carrying the quaffle they flew forwards breaking apart the defence formation with kirke and sloper protecting them from bludgers harry shot towards the keeper like a javelin managing to intimidate him into moving out of the way which left the goals open for ginny to score in on defence harry firebolt tore apart almost all the attempts that hufflepuff had to score half an hour later gryffindor was leading 310 to 50 never mind harry show them some mercy just catch the snitch hollered ron harry nodded and started zooming around the pitch looking for the snitch within ten minutes he had caught the snitch seamus and ginny had scored twice apiece and gryffindor had won 500 to 50 in one of hogwarts biggest blowouts ever the crowd had exploded with roars of approval ernie macmillan was muttering about cheap seeker tactics but harry hadntbroken any rules gryffindor won fair and square the gryffindors and ravenclaws were still cheering loudly but the hufflepuffs and the slytherins shot harry looks that plainly said that they werenthappy with his tactics harry couldntcare less as he celebrated with his teammates with a bunch of candy he and ron had sneaked off to hogsmeade and bought back to the gryffindor common room even professor mcgonagall joined in with the festivities she was so glad that gryffindor crushed hufflepuff all in all it felt like they had already won the quidditch cup arm in arm with ginny harry was in bliss unaware of a small timid looking sixth year who had stood far away from the celebrations with his nose buried in a book okay today we split up into two different groups for the rest of the year some of you have been identified as stronger in magic than in body some of you stronger in body than magic you will be grouped accordingly so six of you will be doing wand dueling for the rest of the year six of you will do sword dueling said moody one class wand duelers are granger lovegood potter weasley weasley and zabini you ll stay with me for the rest of the year everyone else please stand with professor hagrid michael corner who had taken colin place let out a groan if you dontwant to take this opportunity then by all means get out of here growled moody who had overheard him harry walked with hermione luna ron ginny and blaise over to moody now you six will be dueling extra intensive curses counter curses and shield charms potter partner weasley no the other one granger go with the other weasley lovegood go with zabini this is what i think is the best pairings you will need to learn to fight as a team now i want to see granger and weasley take on lovegood and zabini with what we ve learnt so far now hermione and ron grimly stepped up onto the stage followed by blaise and luna start in three seconds one two three inteltransverto yelled hermione quickest of all of them blaise and luna hurled two stunning spells which were blocked by ron yelling protego just in the nick of time confundo roared hermione and ron blaise and luna ducked rolled forwards and shouted impedimenta and torrentoria arachnid luna strange spell caused a big rain cloud to appear over hermione and ron and start raining spiders ron with a deadly fear of spiders jumped off the stage yelling out in fright not smart weasley now your partner has to fight two of them growled moody softly hermione looked up to the challenge vanquisho arachnid totalus she said calmly all the spiders in the room disappeared at once torrentoria flamare she yelled a big cloud formed above blaise and luna hurling fireballs down at them within a few seconds they lost hermione stepped down off the stage calmly gave ron a look of disgust and awaited moody comment that was brilliant granger lovegood very good modifications of the raining charm zabini weasley you ve pulled down your partners a bit next time you two go together muttered moody unaware of ron very audible moan now potter weasley give lovegood and granger a challenge wontyou harry walked up to the stage with ginny as they faced luna and hermione everyone in the room including hagrid had turned to watch standing up on the stage were hogwarts best student duelers facing off harry flashed a grin at hermione finally they had a chance to determine who was dumbledore best student as they never dueled against each other since dumbledore lessons start in three one the crowd bent closer to the stage two harry ginny hermione and luna moved into battle position three inteltransverto yelled four voices ginny careful with hermione she got a lot of tricks up her sleeve yeah i noticed was the sarcastic reply he received altare incendio yelled harry the stage was now bordered in a ring of green fire cutting off any escape flipendo yelled luna harry and ginny easily sidestepped the curse cover me multiplicus serpensortia roared harry as seven massive cobras flew out of his wand and directly at luna stupefy yelled luna stunning a snake transfiguro apple yelled hermione ginny disappeared and turned into a red apple people in the stands were laughing uproariously hermione had a satisfied expression on her face argh yelled harry finite incantatem the fire went out but ginny stayed the same he held the apple in one hand his wand in another hermione must ve added a trick harry quickly dived for the floor as two stunning hexes thrown remarkably quickly had reached him expelliarmus yelled harry no one had been expecting that yet it worked as luna wand flew out of her hand and into harry s serpensortia prisone yelled harry using the spell that dumbledore had taught him just that morning luna shrieked as five snakes bound around her tightly i give up she yelled and ran off the stage to get the spell removed apparently luna was afraid of snakes harry thought with a smirk harry and hermione remained each surveying the other waiting for the right moment to strike stellartica lumare roared hermione as a beam of silver stars flashed towards harry and blinded his vision for a few seconds stupefy protego hermione spell flew back at her but she dodged it with ease teleporto harry she yelled and harry appeared suddenly right in front of her harry was mystified he thought that apparition was impossible in hogwarts but apparently teleportation put by someone else on him would work expelliarmus stupefy yelled both of them at the same time hermione slumped and fell over but harry was sent flying across the stage and his wand landed next to hermione sweet merlin a tie potter get your wand take these curses off miss granger and miss lovegood please ennervate vanquisho serpent said harry calmly after grabbing his wand mione take the thing off gin hermione muttered something and ginny reappeared in harry arms a loud ooooooooh went through the class harry what happened why are you carrying me when did the duel end hermione giggled i turned you into an apple and harry held you around the whole time he wouldnteven put you down when we sent stunners flying at him ginny giggled too my hero she whispered softly and pulled harry into a kiss harry felt awkward as he still held her in his arms his face turning red an even louder ooooooooh went through the class moody laughed a bark like laugh all right potter weasley granger lovegood you four are dismissed for tonight good show weasley and zabini stay here you two need some more training harry still carrying ginny walked up to the head boy common room with hermione after saying goodbye to luna hermione what the hell was that how come i couldnttransform ginny back you re not the only one that learnt things from dumbledore harry harry raised his eyebrow i taking it you re not about to tell me how to do that nope harry had placed ginny down on the sofa and sat down by her with his arm around her figures he said gin you feeling adventurous harry had opened the envelope from his parents a day before finding a letter from both of them a separate letter from james and sirius and a wizarding photo of him with his parents taken by sirius during his one month visit dear harry it has been a wonderful month with you and i must say we are proud beyond proud to see what our son grows up to be it really was a shock to one day come home sit down for dinner and find our future son the greatest wizard of our time and our son best friend we really near had a heart attack once it really sank in remember what albus dumbledore had said if you ever need to talk to us we will remember you in this separate plane of existence should you need to talk to us know that we will always be here for you and in your own timeline we will always watch over you love mum and dad dear harry we found a secret room in hogwarts back in our day it was the school best make out place ever naturally we claimed this room for ourselves we used it for planning pranks and adventures and of course for snog sessions harry had laughed at that point he couldntimagine remus lupin sneaking off to have a snog with some girl his dad and sirius he d rather not think about it anyway it a small hole with a mwpp scratched around it it just enough to fit a wand in you can find it on the wall opposite to the staircase to the divination tower stick your wand inside and say i solemnly swear i am up to no good make sure no one is around the hole will open up and you can walk into the room once you re in make sure you close the hole by saying any marauder nickname you reopen and close using the same words take only people you trust take the marauder legacy to the next generation padfoot and prongs harry had decided to take ginny there first what do you have in mind harry said ginny with a giggle hermione groaned oh man i dontwant to see this night gin night harry ginny had a twinkle in her eye as she asked again what do you have in mind something i want to share with you the marauder room accio invisibility cloak do we really need an invisibility cloak i mean the head boy and a prefect walking around at night isntthat suspicious we might need it later better safe than sorry c mon gin they walked up to the floor where the staircase to the divination tower was look for a small hole which has mwpp engraved around it it took them fifteen minutes but eventually ginny found it over here she whispered harry walked over stuck his first and best holly and phoenix feather wand into the hole and said softly i solemnly swear i am up to no good the hole started to magically expand until it was big enough to admit a relatively average sized person harry took a deep breath and climbed in as he crawled out he gasped ginny followed right after him harry saw a sign on the wall like a hogwarts seal only replacing the lion snake eagle and badger with a stag a rat a dog and a wolf in the center was a golden m instead of the hogwarts h there were magically lit candles burning dimly a comfortable looking sofa a table with four chairs and a big drawer as ginny walked on in harry turned around waved his wand and said prongs the hole shrunk again and the drawer magically opened and food popped out harry assumed that the house elves sent it up wow this place is amazing said harry he walked over to the seal and pressed the stag with his wand music played softly harry knew that it was his dad song he almost laughed at the thought of his dad bringing his mother up here ginny squealed with delight i love this song come on let dance before he knew it he held her in his arms revolving slowly with her absorbed in the music they shared a dance and a long kiss deep into the night lost in each other embrace for the first time in his life the boy who lived felt the true power of love in dumbledore office the professors mcgonagall snape and moody were gathered with the headmaster dumbledore handed snape a potion and waved his wand healing the minor bruises and said what have you to report severus voldemort is plotting to take potter or at least one of his friends to use as bait when where and how when the students go to hogsmeade this weekend he has a wizard strike force of one hundred i heard from avery and nott that voldemort was going to go himself this isntgood they have enough force to even strike here at hogwarts call fudge at the ministry minerva get him to send some aurors for that day i ll summon the order of the phoenix and alert them of the situation severus alert the members of the staff and the head boy and head girl alastor i want you to check the defence wards of the school and add any extra wards you can think of but headmaster if the hogsmeade weekend is cancelled my cover will be blown it will be blown if we somehow stop the attack anyway you have done a good job severus but i cannot allow voldemort to take harry before he is ready to fight this will be the first of many sacrifices we must take to buy him more time but surely we could severus i cannot allow any of my students to be harmed by voldemort the hogsmeade weekend shall be canceled and you shall not return to voldemort that is final severus snape sighed yes headmaster now go our time to prepare is short everyone meet back in my office in two hours the four teachers swept out of the headmaster office twilight evabandmamaber13 chapter nine preparations where on earth is potter snapped snape at a still sleepy hermione ron had his arm around her in a protective fashion but she shook it impatiently off no idea ask ginny or something miss weasley is gone too where is potter map we need to find him now no need professor here i am what do you need said harry who had just walked through the portrait hole with a sleeping ginny in his arms what i need potter is for you to stop being ridiculous and put miss weasley down and for you and granger get your inflated heads into the headmaster office now snarled snape yes professor replied harry ron could you take ginny up to her bed please he handed the sleeping ginny lightly into her brother arms like a porcelain doll and walked with hermione and snape out of the door snape walked ahead of them choosing to act as if they werentthere whilst harry was wondering what on earth he had done to be summoned to the headmaster office hermione was twittering away where did you go harry you smell like ginny perfume and you have her lip gloss shining on your cheeks harry shot hermione a smirk that asked do you really want to know hermione groaned and shook her head i didntthink so potter granger in snapped snape harry and hermione walked into dumbledore office to find all the members of staff cornelius fudge and all the members of the order of the phoenix assembled there waiting patiently for those two my apologies headmaster for the delay but potter found it necessary to go sneak off somewhere with ms weasley mr and mrs weasley shot harry fervent looks at that and gave harry a small nod each it isntof any matter severus harry hermione please take a seat said dumbledore with a wave of his hand conjuring up three more chairs for snape harry and hermione now firstly cornelius have you any information on voldemort recent moves cornelius fudge swept off his lime bowler hat and straightened himself up i afraid to say that you know who is slowly gaining a strong grip hold on britain as we speak death eaters attack at random positions and destroy entire villages obliviators working overtime every night it just like the first war all over again what of his follower strength and numbers we have seen and identified at least six hundred dark wizards in great britain alone harry had expected a gasp or something from the people sitting in dumbledore office six hundred dark wizards on voldemort side he thought to himself ridiculous however the ministry has reason to believe that there are even more thank you cornelius that will be all for now dumbledore had then turned to each order member in turn and asked them questions by half an hour harry and hermione had found out that voldemort had already taken the entire country of iceland and part of ireland already and was slowing closing a death grip on norway sweden and finland harry was also shocked to find that azkaban had been completely taken over by dark forces and now ministry members and aurors were being held there if they were captured and withholding information the room had dissolved into quiet chatter as dumbledore pulled snape aside and had a few words with him when dumbledore had stood up and the room fell silent severus here has returned with voldemort plans as most of you know he is a spy and recently he has found out the most important plot yet a kidnap attempt will be made on mr potter or one of his friends in an effort to lure him into a trap the planned date was the hogsmeade weekend in two days the outing will be canceled of course and the school defences set on high alert however the most disturbing fact is that voldemort has a strike force of one hundred dark wizards to capture mr potter everyone in this room will be defending the school including mr potter and his friends and any aurors the ministry can spare we must not allow his plot to succeed i daresay everyone in this room knows how important mr potter here is everyone in the room nodded even snape although he did it grudgingly mr potter and his friends will be able to participate for three reasons firstly two of his friends are prefects and standing in front of us are the head boy and girl secondly all of mr potter friends are remarkably well trained in dueling especially these two here doubtless all of you know that that ronald weasley and harry potter here were involved in the battle of diagon alley and they showed that they can handle the situation finally for the sake of the wizarding world morale mr potter presence is important again everyone in the room nodded cornelius how many aurors can you spare fifty to sixty at most harry was amazed at how the minister had changed now that the public knew that voldemort had returned that will do now when voldemort finds that there is no one at hogsmeade he will come to hogwarts as he has enough firepower at his disposal now i need twenty aurors positioned in the forest the other aurors should be positioned around the castle and the members of the order will guard the students at the front doors be here the on the night of friday you may leave unless you have any questions harry hermione please find ron and ginny weasley and inform them of our plans their attendance is optional dumbledore sank back down into his chair looking older than ever harry guessed that his old age must be getting to him at last people in dumbledore office started leaving either through the fireplace or out the door harry can i have a word harry turned and approached remus lupin hello remus how have you been as well as i can be given the circumstances now the reason i wanted to talk to you is about saturday i know that nothing i say will change your mind about going but i asking you now please dontdo anything rash it okay remus i won t thank you for caring harry embraced the older man and when he broke away he saw a faint trace of a smile just like james harry just like james remus flashed harry a genuine smile although it was a sad smile from a man who had suffered more than what should be allowed in a lifetime losing all of his close friends with another hug and a pat on the back remus lupin walked back into dumbledore office harry and hermione went back to the head boy and girl dorms finding ron sleeping on the couch harry and hermione decided to wait until the next morning to tell the two weasleys as they tiptoed to their own respective rooms and went to bed the next morning harry and hermione broke the news to ron and ginny before they went to breakfast you re joking they wouldntdream of attacking at hogwarts would they one hundred dark wizards anyway they want us to participate hermione and i because we re head boy and girl you two because well you re weasleys and you re our best friends said harry but you know who wouldntdare attack hogwarts with dumbledore here would he look ron i dontknow if its just me but dumbledore doesntseem to be in that high a level of physical fitness anymore yesterday when he was holding the meeting after he dismissed everyone he immediately slumped into his chair and he looked really frail said harry yeah i saw that too nodded hermione do you reckon we should go see him about it are you crazy go to the headmaster and say oh i noticed you werentlooking so well lately are you getting too old to function properly asked ron not like that began hermione but turned quiet before she finished the sentence it was in a dark mood that the quartet walked down to breakfast harry caught dumbledore eye and nodded sitting down to a plate of scrambled eggs with ham he heard hermione shout harry what what look your egg it hatching what oh harry gently removed the egg from his open backpack and placed it on the breakfast table where he watched the pattern shake he watched motionlessly unsure of what to do by now many gryffindors had gathered around harry egg oh my god i have to check on my egg shrieked parvati and sprinted away followed closely by lavender oh look a bit of the shell broke off yelled somebody harry bent forwards to look into the egg all he saw were a pair of green eyes staring back at him he almost flinched another piece of the shell broke off as a small mewing sound came from the creature inside another shake and the shell broke open it was a small black creature looking exactly like a cat picking it up gingerly harry said funny cats arentsupposed to be born from eggs are they the kitten had immediately shut its eyes and had snuggled up against harry shoulder letting out another long meeeeow awwww it so cute squealed ginny and hermione at the same time but why is a cat born in an egg that no ordinary cat harry i going to the library to check come with me and with that hermione dragged harry off to the library harry stomach growled loudly but hermione the kitten had now opened its eyes wow harry look it eyes are exactly the same color as yours come to think of it it really resembles you messy black hair green eyes yeah i saw but come on if we re going to do some research before dumbledore class we better hurry we have fifteen minutes let just get the books and sign them out harry and hermione ran and pulled down magical cats different breeds of cat and rare species of cat from the shelves stuffed it under the vulture like librarian nose and signing them out they ran to the gargoyles outside of dumbledore office and shouted acid pop and quickly sprinted up the stairs ah harry hermione i see your mysticat has hatched wonderfully loyal creatures they are once they bond with a wizard they stay with them until they die they gain very unique magical powers as they grow with the wizard seeing harry and hermione looks of disbelief dumbledore smiled tiredly and said did i just ruin hours of research or did you by any chance expect something else neither professor i just shocked that i got such a good creature for my class but could i ask a favor could you perhaps tell me what gender it is asked harry oh that a male mysticat replied dumbledore now on with the lesson harry hermione can you please call ronald and virginia up to my office please today will be a training session for what to happen tomorrow here take these notes with you to give to the lesson teachers i daresay you know where the two are now harry and hermione nodded took the notes and walked off gin in divination i ll get her you go get ron he should be in charms now said harry and the two ran off in separate directions running up to the divination tower he climbed up the staircase and smiled at the sixth year class with his mysticat on his shoulder ooooh such a cute kitty squealed a few of the sixth year girls in delight hello professor trelawney may i snatch ginny away from you for today important business with professor dumbledore i have a note out of the corner of his eye he saw dumbledore head in the fire and he gave it a wink business with dumbledore that an excuse if i ve ever heard one whispered one of ginny friends and they collapsed in giggles ah mr potter i have just seen something horrible in the crystal ball let me guess i get killed one way or another my you do seem to have developed the inner eye over the two years we ve been apart professor i d love to stay and talk but i really do need to collect ginny we have some urgent business with dumbledore but mr potter you must know what i ve seen you will be betrayed oh it horrible yes i afraid so professor i just hope my death isntlong and drawn out i d rather just die quickly wouldntyou ever so a hero mr potter if only you knew what awaits you well i ll be going with my damsel in distress now if you dontmind battle awaits and the hero must sharpen his sword said harry in a sarcastic way but trelawney didntnotice wiping a tear away from her eye she said go on go on the whole class was already filled with giggles and laughter as harry led ginny towards the staircase climbed down and yelled loudly jump fair maiden in distress for i will catch you in your moment of need the sixth year class had erupted with roars of laughter at that and trelawney said now really harry was grinning like a cheshire cat when he and ginny had walked down the stairs going to dumbledore office ginny still caught in her fit of giggles acid pop said harry as they reached the gargoyles a nice show you put on there harry smiled dumbledore as he and ginny sat down hermione and ron were already sitting harry grinned back at dumbledore saying thanks professor okay i ll be straight with you four you are the four are amongst the most brilliant of students to come to hogwarts as of late hermione in particular has achieved the highest grades hogwarts has seen since tom riddle anyway tomorrow voldemort is supposedly going to attack the school it is my responsibility to make sure that you are well protected tomorrow you could imagine the consequences if one of you were to get seriously injured dumbledore had probably expected one of them to wince or look around nervously but the four teens sat there stonily looking the headmaster in the eye he afforded himself a little smile today i will teach you the immensely powerful absorption charm it works by sapping the target magical power into you for a period of five minutes none more this will in effect almost double your magical power allow you to do various things you usually would not be able to do such as unforgivable curses but you wontbe doing that the key point is that for five minutes your opponent is left a muggle in which you can disarm or stun them the incantation is parasitran magica you may practice on these with a flick of his wand dumbledore summoned four dummies it was a long and terribly hard process to practice as the beam of light moved a lot slower than a normal spell and dumbledore enchanted the dummies to dodge the hexes thrown by the four students after an hour of throwing the same hex dumbledore held up his hand and asked them to stop professor why is it that this spell moves so much slower than the other hexes asked hermione before harry had a chance a good question hermione it is because you have not practiced enough all of your hexes are very weak and slow right now because it hasntbeen used enough yet enough we ve been using the same spell for an hour professor cried ron yes well let me show you what it should look like at nearly full power my magic isntwhat it used to be with that dumbledore hurled four of the absorption charms into the dummies and harry saw that the charm flew even faster than the average stunning charm the dummies flew and hit the wall collapsing into four heaps with a wave of his wand the dummies disappeared by the end of today i expect all four of you to at least equal that effect would you four like some refreshment before we try again the four famished teens nodded and before them platefuls of pasta appeared in front of them on the table with a goblet of butterbeer at the side a bowl of fish and a bowl of milk appeared on the ground for harry mysticat ron sighed contently as he helped himself to the delicious food the mysticat purred as it lapped up the milk and ate the fish contently harry smiled inwardly at the similarity between the baby kitten and his seventeen year old friend soon the food and drink was finished shall we return to our exercises asked dumbledore summoning up the four dummies again harry hermione ginny and ron had now managed to hit a dummy every once in a while and the speed of the hexes were now just a bit slower than the stunning curses when it was five o clock in the afternoon harry managed to throw the absorption charm so quickly that he hadntmissed a single dummy in his last seven shots hermione was around his level although ginny and ron were still casting the charm as fast as they would a stunning spell dumbledore smiled down at them now harry hermione try to stun all of the dummies before they reach you with another wave of his wand there were twelve dummies standing motionlessly at the other end of dumbledore office go the dummies ran towards harry and hermione at a disturbingly fast speed stupefy stupefy stupefy cried harry and hermione many times in succession surprisingly they found that the spells flew much faster than they used to only one dummy had reached them very good very good you see as you become more fluent in casting curses and hexes almost all of the spells you learn can be improved in speed and power the absorption spell is one of the slowest spells that can be cast since you now can cast it with reasonable speed i daresay that you wontfind the death eaters too much a challenge now why dontyou four run off and enjoy yourselves for a while before dinner i suggest you get an early sleep for tonight we will need to be prepared for tomorrow i must go set up the defences good afternoon said dumbledore dismissing them as soon as harry hermione ron and ginny walked out of the office albus dumbledore collapsed in his chair moaning softly clutching at his heart in pain minerva mcgonagall had walked out of the fireplace and said softly albus albus albus you actually did it didntyou oh merlin beard wait here i ll fetch a potion from severus the teenagers were oblivious to the fact as they walked down to visit hagrid that they had sapped some of their own headmaster power to permanently keep for their own in the war that
