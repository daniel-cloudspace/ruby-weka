 i d like to point out that though i take an immense amount of pride in this story it wasntso good at the beginning i think we all can see our writing change and mine certainly has so the first couple of chapters are written in a different way from the rest of them and i ask you not to judge too quickly i would rewrite if i could find the time but all i can assure you is that it does get better i appreciate reviews of any sort but i dontappreciate negative reviews that arentjustified so if you hate my story give me a reason why other than because of the way i spell ohkay thanks disclaimer i dontown any characters or rights to anything jk rowling created summary october 1977 7th year at hogwarts for james potter and co the marauders do what they ve always been doing and lily evans is of course along for the ride chapter 1 october beginnings abc james potter was everything i hated mainly because he was everything i wanted he was handsome and charming suave and sleek composed and strong he was everything a potter should be his family was well known in the wizarding world so many generations of potter having ranked high up in the ministry of magic i think his grandfather was minister of magic at some point but none of that is here nor there james potter was the smartest wizard in our year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry that how he came to get head boy his friends were all gorgeous save for peter and they were all popular including peter even though they were so popular it not like every girl wanted them especially not james because he kept to himself something i ll elaborate on later every girl wanted sirius though because he quite the lady man it like that character written in a story that always has to be the same no matter how many lifetimes sirius may have lived through and no matter how many stories he could be written in to he d always be the flaming gorgeous idiot with a list of non ceasing come on lines remus lupin was quite like james he kept to himself a bit less than james however he d laugh loudly along with sirius while james laughed his quiet heh heh heh of a laugh his eyes staying downcast and peter was just along for the ride it seemed no one understood why james was so introverted with the friends he had loud boisterous marauders or how he could be sure he had a few girlfriends so did the rest of his friends usually just flings to keep themselves satisfied but james only had serious relationships because he would never get in to one if it wasntgoing to be serious you ask any girl he dated and they d tell you he wouldntkiss until at least the fourth date and that would be without any tongue he opened doors pulled out chairs held hands paid for dinner and assisted with coats some girls just wanted to date him because of his flat out genuine chivalry but those girls who just wanted to date him because of his gentlemen ways and boyish good looks ended up falling deeper than they expected i dontthink in all the 7 years i had known him or known of him had we spoke one word to the other he d send me small smiles like he d send to everyone he passed by in corridors and perhaps asked to borrow a quill one time in potions class in fourth year but never had i actually talked to james potter i only observed him because he was interesting watching his small motions and movements the way he d rub his index finger over his right cheek just below his glasses when he was asked a question in class or by anyone for that matter just the little things were absolutely entrancing because he had such a way you probably think i obsessed with detail or obsessed with digging into other peoples lives well you would be too if you had my friends my friends were rather ditzy i had one best friend and the rest i just acted stupid with i think it was something to do with sirius black all of them had snogged him at one point and i think that did something to them anyways my friends are another story another time this is james potter and the marauders this is uncovering into an engima this is exporing my 7th year this is my story of how the marauders changed everything that was lily evans into lily evans plus i never once imagined i d be giving credit to james potter the marauders for who i turned out to be what i hoped was a good person mid october 1977 the gryffindor common room was always some place i didntmind being especially now that i had this shiny head girl badge pinned to my chest i could tell those bickering little 13 year olds to keep it quiet and i could set a curfew for the 1st 2nd years i could deduct points and i could stay up as late as i wanted being a 7th year with privilages was turning out quite good i was sitting on the carpeted floor leaning up against the couch with my stuff spread out on the oak coffee table i was waiting for james potter i had to admit i was nervous this was the james potter this was the james potter that was so stiff sometimes acted like he had a stick up his ass and quiet that other people just became quiet when they were near him they were like me they couldnthelp but watch him and i was also nervous because this was the first time in a month and a half of head duties that we were actually going to speak and discuss things it was funny i always liked the marauders always talked with them and joked we were just all friends because we were in the same year i suppose but i could warm up to peter more than i could warm up to james sure he was everything i said he was at the beginning handsome suave sophisticated and composed handsome suave sophisticated and composed handsome suave sophisticated and composed over and over god and he was all of that whilst being a quiet mysterious type guy plus he didntseem to like me much it was strange the things you pick up on over the years the people who gradually befriend you the people who you instantly notice the people who seem to avoid you as much as possible now i was never trying to be paranoid i do realize that hogwarts has probably over 1000 people and i do realize there are loads of people in gryffindor alone but james sat near me in most classes his friends hung out with my friends and we should ve had hung out with each other but as quiet as he was it was like he became quieter when i was around i noted that most people were staggering off to bed it was a thursday night and most people just wanted to get friday over with so they were off to the dorms by around 10 the marauders only three of them i quickly realized and james wasntone and a few other 7th years were left i chewed my nails as i waited for james potter to make his appearance he was rather pissing me off at 10 45 peter remus were off to bed and sirius came over to the couch i was slumped against prongs well james is upstairs by the way i blinked doing what it sounded stupid but if he was off sleeping or something i was going to kill him ah and to the surprise of no one he was in fact sleeping james potter liked his sleep it seemed apparent to us over the years honestly he worried me at times he worried all of 7th year girls really was the boys dorm really the interesting we always wondered no it really wasn t because before 7th year was over i had seen it many a time no mr james potter in fact did like his sleep and didntlike the common room yeah i changed that i dunno sleepin sirius rumpled his hair up while yawning ohkay later later i remember raising my eyebrows until my forehead creased painfully and sirius snickered slightly sirius was so nonchalant which was something else i never understood until much much later he was a black for christ sake we all knew about it regulus black and his relatives in slytherin he should ve had the weight of the world on his shoulders but he carried it off so well in earlier years i thought he was a conceited prat which he actually was in a joking way but after after they showed me all that mattered i realized yeah sirius black was a good guy even better guy for putting up with how james was and yeah finally i admired him for everything he went through took me some years to admit that one would you like me to go wake him i could ve punched him really please and thank you sirius i sighed exasperatedly and leaned back against the couch all right lily see he was a good guy 3 minutes and 22 seconds later james finally emerged rumpling his hair in that way only him sirius did sorry he yawned and murmured situating himself on the opposite side of the coffee table so that he was facing me it just seemed to hit me like a bucket of cold water james potter apologizing for over sleeping at night was the first actual word he had said to me that one word had started it all that one word was the beginning of an era almost was the beginning of salvation and redemption was the beginning of all that mattered it ohkay we ve not much to cover anyways it would be hard to forget the way his eyes looked a hazy hazel colour they always seemed misted over with infuriatingly deep thoughts green and brown merged into one his eye colour didntmean much to me then but i remember the flush in my cheeks as he rubbed his eyes and placed his glasses back on and then looked at me ohkay god the way the corners of his mouth kept twitching upwards for a moment i thought he was going to say something more um i cleared my throat uncomfortably and james stretched out until his back came to rest against the couch behind him he folded his arms over his chest and focused his eyes on the parchment books spread out on the table i thought we didnthave a lot to cover he raised his eyebrows though only slightly as if he didntwant to let on that it bothered him or that he couldnthandle it he was always like that we don t it just a load of shit i trying to catch up on this would be the first time he smiled at anything i said head girl behind in her studies alert the media i smiled a bit too it hard sometimes i guess i mean i ve never liked classes i just dontwant to have to be extra studious because i head girl i donteven know how i am head girl i just ohkay so i was thinking not a lot of balls or dances nothing for halloween that was a wreck last year we should just have inner house parties or something maybe a dance for christmas maybe not maybe one at the end of the year and nothing for valentine day d you hate dances james potter asked in a monotone sitting up and jotting the things i had just said down basically james nodded noted there was five minutes of silence in which i pretended to look over notes and he pretended to write them things had become oddly tense so you are always quiet no matter who around i looked around the common room realizing we were pretty much alone this didntsit too well with james potter evans this is the most we ve spoken in 6 years and it wouldntprobably be the best time to start throwing your observations in my face he was too proper to be harsh you ve always been one to make assumptions now who the one making assumptions we ve never spoken yet i ve always been one to make assumptions i suppose we re even then you stay a judemental bitch and i ll stay quiet he tore the piece of parchment that he had written on off and handed it to me here goodnight evans well we were off to a good start but that just it we weren t i wanted to try because what the hell was i going to lose in gaining another friend god it took me ages to win him over he was stubborn too by the way determined james potter had thick sticky outy black hair he had thin framed glasses because he was near sighted and he had broad shoulders he had perfect posture and he had a nice chest his arms werentover muscular and his legs were long which made us wonder how he was so good at qudditch he had hazel eyes and a nice husky voice along with a set of pearly whites his handwriting was neat his feet were a size 11 and he always needed to wear socks to bed his name was james potter and it took me about a year to find out his middle name they were always called the marauders i donteven remember the first time i actually heard it said it was just almost like instinct to refer to those 4 boys as the marauders wormtail moony padfoot and prongs they were four guys who not many understood they were four guys who seemed to slack off as much as possible but work hard to be assholes but be undeniably sweet keep to themselves but let everyone know the marauders contradicted everything that they were i didntcare if people didntlike me i know there are people who dontlike me there are people i dontlike i have my friends though so it nothing that i dwelled on it nothing i realized and it nothing that bothered me until that night with james potter it drove me crazy i couldnt stop thinking about how he was so short with me when i didnteven mean anything by what i had said and he called me a judgmental bitch i called him quiet it was something simple and it was something that could be taken as a compliment or taken as nothing at all i had never actually spoken to him before but after being around a person for 6 years and some you realize who quiet and who not you realize a bit of their personalities whether you speak to them or not but you dontcall somebody a judgmental bitch when you ve never spoken to them how would james potter know if i was a judgmental bitch if he didntactually know me i dontgo around calling people out and telling them how absolutely ugly they are or sneering at people when they talk to me because they hang out with a certain crowd or something i think i fairly nice the only people i may be a bit judgmental towards are the syltherins but who isn t and at first it had made me mad and i made a mental note not to ever talk to him again we could split the head duties later that night though i just i started wondering if i really was that damn horrible i mean i had acquaintances almost friends i had one i guess best friend jada honestly jada was great she was so little and sweet sounding but could be such a bitch she might ve been just over 5 feet and had straight light brown hair that fell past her shoulders she liked boys and i knew that boys caused problems we clashed over that a lot her always having a boyfriend and just not being there when i needed her laying in my bed realizing how absolutely right james was i was going over it in my head and recalling everything i had just thought i thought my best friend was a bitch the closest thing to a best friend i d ever had i thought all boys were the same obnoxious decieving assholes i was a judgmental bitch i hadntcried in front of anybody for years i hadntcried at all for months but the next day it seemed all i could do i threw myself into the shower and dressed in my uniform untying the double knots in my shoes as i walked down the stairs in to the common room the laces were too long and when i just tied them once the ends drug along the ground i was thoroughly cursing my lazy habit of kicking my shoes off and untying them the next morning oh bloody hell i bemoaned sinking to the floor at the end of the stairs and tossing my schoolbag onto the floor as i dug through it looking for my wand tears were filling my eyes and i remember how absolutely awful i looked that morning despite the random bouts of crying i was fair skinned anyway so the dark circles under my eyes from not much sleep and lots of crying contrasted horribly with my skin finally i tossed my shoe to the floor and threw my head in my hands the tears falling faster when i seen jada leave the common room with a boy boys god damn boys may i be of assistance the voice was a guys and sounded fairly amused i turned round with a look of desperation on my face sirius black in all of his just woke up and i still look good glory his hair was so bloody thick and wavy girls envied him it was dark dark chestnut brown and his eyes were a grey ish blue what would be considered a dull blue but it had so much depth that it was just absolutely mezmerizing he had pretty eyes he was sinewy he was more muscular than james was when it came to arms but james was the qudditch captain and absolutely fit because of it his shoulders werentthat broad and they were often slouched followed by his fists jammed into his pockets looking horribly innocent and casual girls fell at his feet but i for one was quite happy with just being friends with him and remus please and thank you sirius he stooped down and took my shoe and fiddled with the laces for a moment before tugging them loose from the knot he then did the other i was just staring off into space not realizing what he was doing until he was doing it i wasntas uncomfortable with it as i thought i d be he bent my knee and angled my foot out so he could slide my shoe onto my left foot he tied the laces somehow without knotting them they were perfect length he slipped my right shoe on and tied the laces on that one too as i tilted my head to the side and watched him with a small smile you ve been crying he said not so intelligibly the red streaks down my cheeks and the bloodshot to my eyes was more than enough to give that away i sighed however and wiped a moist trail away from my cheek with the back of my hand fuck i muttered noting the black smear on my hand and remembering i had put mascara on damn cosmetics sirius seemed as if he couldnthelp but grin and tentatively reached a hand out to my cheek little bit left there may i i dontthink he was ever that courteous before that or after for that matter i recall him telling me sometime later that a damsel in distress was his weakness he couldnthelp but let the shakespearen like words and sentences flow of course i obliged his hands were rather rugged as if he had done much damage to them in a short amount of time it was an odd contrast really his complexion was darker than mine and his hands were cool as they smoothed over my warm cheek wiping the mascara away it was it was then with sirius that our two worlds really fused my world and the marauders world james potter had f ing drove me to insanity with a simple statement and sirius black was going to fix that can i ask you something i asked him quietly as he pulled his hand back and his eyes went down to the well done job he did at tying my shoes of course do you find james potter to be an influential person i spoke quickly and bit my bottom lip sharply as i finished sirius black laughed and laughed and once he finished he cleared his throat and had a bit of a flush to his cheeks i ll never to this day know why he found it so funny if you find a quiet kind shell of a man influential then sure ohkay well if he called you a bastard would you take it to heart sirius nodded as if understanding what i meant now not if he just called me a bastard buuut say he called me a manipulative bastard yeah then i d probably be a bit hurt i sat with a rather somber face as i put my hair behind my ears and shook my head slowly he called me a judgmental bitch i wanted to cry again oh sweetheart charming barstard black always was that what with all the tears come now no boy worth em specially not james he grinned his cheeky grin though i didntrealize he tickled your fancy that way i scrunched my nose up at the thought of james potter tickling my or anybody s fancy he doesn t i ve hardly spoken to the boy in my whole life but last night i just call him quiet and he calls me a judgmental bitch for some reason it just absolutely shattered me it really should mean nothing for the simple fact that i hardly do know him and hardly have spoken to him but it scary because at times it like he reading me like a book like he can find out as much as he wants to of me with a snap of his fingers and sirius was laughing again and then hoisting himself to his feet he picked my school bag up and slung it over his shoulder with his own and then offered me his hand you know what you need he shook his shaggy brown hair from his eyes as we began making our way to breakfast you need more friends good friends best friends you ve only got catty whores to contend with james could do with some female influence wouldntit be crazy if you guys became friends it was my turn to laugh but i did so quietly i still felt absolutely depressed and dramatic i dontknow sirius we rounded the corner and made our way down the last set of stairs before the marble staircase honestly though i d like it if you were around us more it d be good interesting healthy for us all we arrived at the bottom of the staircase he strided ahead of me turned around and grinned at me then walked off without me my pink beige coloured school bag swinging gracefully from his shoulder hope it half decent thus far reviews would be appreciated you know you wannnna love kaitlyn chapter 10 watch the world pass by when i woke all i really know is that james wasn t there my head wasntrested on his chest and he wasntacting as my security blanket i briefly wondered how long he had stayed laying with me i found out later that it wasntlong before he decided the floor looked more appealing not even the seat he had been sitting in the floor what time is it i muttered almost the instant my eyes were open i was anxious to get off this blasted train but there was no response because james potter was the only other person in my compartment and he was fast asleep i bit my lip and tried to be discrete as i reached for his wrist and checked his glowing watch 12 35 god we should kinda sorta be there soon i sighed and laid my head flat against the seat rather than on the pillow the blanket was thin and i shivered it was warm though i was shivering purely from nerves the source of light in the compartments had been turned off completely and only dim lights lit the hallways outside of the window though street building lights could be seen as we sped along we must ve been nearing the city i watched those little dots of orange glow merge into one in the black of the night and compartment my head was spinning and i averted my eyes to james his glasses were askew and his head tilted to the side resting on his arms i smiled and reached a hand out to touch his silky looking hair but the train took a final lurch and stopped the lights blinking on i sat up and allowed the blanket which i realized james must have covered me up with to slide off of me james i murmured rubbing my face and nudging him with my knee he was leaning against the wall of the compartment sitting up beside where my head had been laying just right there almost like he had been watching over wake up i didntfinish my thought i think we re here his eyes opened slowly and he rubbed beneath them yawning hugely what an ungodly time for the train to get in he offered me a tired grin which i returned but i was sure my eyes looked a bit worse than his own the next ten minutes was a hetic blur that i cantproperly remember i vaguely remember getting off the train saying something about having to get our luggage and james chuckling there are perks to being a potter i ve had it sent straight to the house let just go i thought for a moment of going to find sirius and remus to say goodbye but hell they all had assured me that i d probably be seeing them everyday of holidays so i followed behind james as we walked through platform 9 3 4 got out of the train station and stood out in the parking lot until we spotted his father car that when everything stopped being such a fast paced blur people faces were clear and everything was slow and bright and i was suddenly very there very much there standing next to james potter my hand inching towards his because i felt as if i d not move a bit unless he tugged me along after him james sensed this or something he looked over at me and almost instantly down at my hand stretched out near his he smiled and pointed out his father car come on i went to grab his hand but he pulled it back lily the second you realize my parents arentout to get you is the second this will all get easier you dontneed to hold my hand you re a big girl and you ve been through a hell of a lot more nerve wracking things picking out what to wear for instance honestly this hardly even compares to that we were walking towards that red shining car even in the moonlight it was shining it going to be fine believe me we were still walking we were a foot away how the bloody hell did this happen it like he talked i followed and i was transfixed or something i took a deep startled breath that nearly choked me because the air was so cold when the door to the driver side opened and a man emerged i had seen mr potter before but it was like i was expecting something different this time around someone more intimidating and smiling less kindly and looking to his son with less light in his eyes dad this is lily and james smiled at me with some kind of a surprisingly proud or warm or something smile hello lily the two didntwaste any time exchanging pleasntries with one another james jumped head first into introducing me and i could ve hugged him standing off on the side lines while he talked to someone else we both knew i was no good at the tall broad shouldered man extended his large hand and i quickly took it surprised at the warmth in it mr potter hi i somehow croaked out dad please tell her to call you jude james dad grinned a grin that was so like his son s james looked sideways at me he likes to think he intimidating he will bask in any abundant respect you give him oh yes please call me jude he said still shaking my hand all right jude may i stop shaking your hand now he laughed a booming laugh and he let go of my hand and i was actually well i dontknow i didntexpect it james suddenly became everything he wasnt he was joking and laughing and smiling and looking proud and he was almost completely different save for those few times i had seen him break down his walls december 19th no 20th seeming it was almost 1 am december 20th freezing cold out and james and his father were laughing at me and for some reason i felt more at home now than i had in years your head freezing yet dad james asked his bald headed father and he rolled his eyes you just wait it ll be you some day you ll get sick of that mess on your head and yes it is cold let get you kids home jude walked back to get into the car and both james and i went for the door to the backseat nearest to where we were standing by the way lexi couldntget to sleep so she ll be up awaiting your arrival what about mum james asked pulling the door open and letting me climb into the warm vechile it was by far the nicest parked in the lot it had a classic appeal to it and i was not quite sure what make it was but it was certainly an expensive one no she got to get shopping done early tomorrow so she sleeping melly will probably be up with her let go james got into the front seat and i was glad i was sitting directly behind james and not his father he seemed talkative for 1 in the morning melly kind of a built in babysitter doesntmatter what hour you call her she ll come over she lives right across the street he told me turning around to look at me i nodded and said nothing i ohkay i was still adjusting to the warmth of the car and amused at the way james glasses steamed up from the abrupt transition from cold to warm and you may be relieved you donthave to meet mum tonight but lexi ll probably be more overwhelming than her i smiled and surpressed a shudder i excited and my nerves were all tingling so if i had allowed it i probably would ve been trembling like mad how long of a drive is it i asked and james checked the clock about 45 minutes we ll be there at 1 30ish i nodded again and yawned you can lay down if you like yeah dad mr potter signalled his ohkay with a nod but did not tear his eyes away from the road he was extremely focused and he was just one of those people who were that focused on every aspect of their life and it showed james smiled and then turned back around to face the front i stared out of the window for a moment and realized i had almost forgot what the city looked like what it felt like to be surrounded by passing cars and never actually alone even the excessive amount of streetlights were company in this big city they were blurring by so fast that i got rather light headed and did lay down i unbuckled my seat belt curled my legs up and lay my head on the arm rest on the door from where i was laying on this sort of angle i could see the side of james face all washed in the changing lights of the city he looked handsome i always knew james potter was every kind of good looking but never had it been really truly point blank apparent to me that he was handsome his expression wasntblank but more casually pensive he even looked like he might start smiling any second mr potter turned the radio on just enough to hear it properly and i reached my hand out and tapped james shoulder he turned his head to look at me through the same crack that i was seeing him through hey i said softly and taking my hand back what up he turned in the seat so he could look at me better but mr potter didntnotice anything different nothing this is nice though i just i not nervous i excited i grinned and james did too excited good good darling lying down in a moving car had to be one of the most pleasantly strangest feelings ever the ride seemed smoother and you just seemed to flow along not being able to see out the window where the car was headed but somehow knowing it anyway i shut my eyes and listened to the quiet song on the radio not paying much attention to what james was doing darling was a constant thing with him now he turned back into his seat properly but kept looking back to me a slight tilt to his head the last significant thing that happened before i drifted off into my thoughts in an almost sleep was james hand reaching back to where mine was laying by my head near the car door mr potter jude was quite oblivious to this it was nice it was a little secret between the two of us he took my hand in his own and did not let go he pulled my arm gently taking my hand up by him and i had to adjust the way i was stretched out but it didntmatter james looked sideways at his father who was staring intently at the road and smiled a bit as he looked back to me out of the corner of his eye too holding my hand up in the passenger seat the radio playing it soft tune i didntreally fall asleep but it felt very much like waking up when the car stopped moving i heard a open and shut and jude say something to james about going into the house to get lexi i was fighting my eyes i didntwant to open them it was so warm and comfortable in the back seat of james car my eyes flew open as i felt a hand across my forehead and i smiled up at james are you trying to wake me up or keep me sleeping i asked tiredly as he continued to stroke it i not sure i didntwant to wake you but he didntelaborate further but pulled his hand back and allowed me to sit up and get out of the car and i sure if it had been a warmer night i would ve stayed standing there in his driveway for hours staring up at the white house with dark blue almost black trim it was absolutely i didnteven know words enough to describe this you coming james asked and i nodded wordlessly still looking at the house he led me to the front door and opened it and i didnthave the time to look around because a shrill shout of excitement issued from a room to the left of the entrance hallway james was all i heard and then there was a mass of blonde curls and arms flailing around james waist lexi you should be sleeeeping james teased scooping his little sister up into his arms and wrapping one arm around her holding her on his side as he turned to look at me lexi this is lily the little girl bit her lip dramatically and seemed to study me for a moment i think i felt more put on the spot with lexi than with any other member of james family for in the days to come i would meet many but lexi had wide blue eyes and mrs potter eyes were much the same mothers and sisters would be my downfall i thought she then grinned hi lily you re pretty she was the most adorable thing ever thank you so are you james never told me that he never well he never told me you were i think we should beat him i laughed and raised my eyebrows in slight surprise over this mischevious little 5 year old alexandria rose potter go to bed james set her back onto the floor and pecked her on the cheek we ll be here in the morning ohkay ohkay ohkay melly let go melly emerged from the room that lexi had come from and she wasntwhat i expected i expected a sort of alice you know conservative outfit hair tied back into a bun slightly greying but she was young early 20 s maybe she had straight brown hair with all sorts of auburn highlights and it was long she was slim and rather tall she offered james i a grin before heading up the stairs with the little girl james smiled at their retreating backs and i chewed my lip wondering just how long melly had lived across the street all right this is the living room he pointed to the room that lexi melly had been in that the den he pointed through the doorway to the right of the entrance hall you go straight through this hallway and that door there goes into the kitchen and this is upstairs my dad study is just off the living room and i ll show you to your room we said goodnight to mr potter and i quickly looked around the house was rather open the doorways to the den and living room were rather arched and you could see in them from where you stood in the entrance hall there were wood floors in most rooms but rich coloured soft mats seemed to be lay almost everywhere the whole house had a rather victorian look to it very detailed very dark deep colours absolutely gorgeous wooden furniture and just a very simple tasteful classy look to the whole house which i assume would be hard to acheive with a house this huge the upstairs was dark but i could see that it was huge as well this is my floor guest bedrooms too my parents and lexi are the floor we bypassed james had his own floor his own floor out of the whole damn house where his friends could stay and use the guestrooms and he just didntseem like he came from a family so powerful and rich in a way he seemed it i suppose he was very proper and polite to those he needed to be that way to he had a distingushed look to him a slight cleft in his chin and those broad shoulders of his his voice was not too deep but deep enough it was smooth and his british accent was more pronounced i found than sirius s he held an air of superiority and intelligence but not so overwhelming that you d like to hit him there were times i could tell when he was talking to a person of higher authority or somebody he knew he had to offer the utmost respect to he acted pleasantly ignorant to the subject of which they were talking on about if he had heard the story a hundred and fifty times from that many different people he d nod and put on a look of anticipation waiting for them to get to the dramatic finale of their story he was rather good at acting he once told me he did it far too often when i pointed the fact out it was a part of being polite he told me i was acting the ignorant one that day for he d rant on about things and end up repeating them the paragraph he spat out exasperatedly at me was there forever it was james potter complete it was him everything he d always been i remember it so clearly you talk to people you dontwant to talk to do things for people you dontwant to do smile when you want to frown laugh when you want to cry run when you want to crawl this name this family this world is all one big act and i was born into it so lily evans you ve no need to remind me how good at acting i am i do it far too often i remembered just staring at him with an understanding soft gaze not saying anything because james potter sometimes preferred when you did not i looked to james and then around what i could see of the corridor the hallway wasntthat long but quite wide the wood floor up here was of a lighter colour and a long mat rolled through the middle of it it just made it seem more home y mats and vases of flowers and no statues or stone walls it was comfortable even if it was huge to the left side of the hall there were 2 guest rooms one bathroom and a lounge with a pool table and what not to the right there was james room 1 guestroom and a sitting area set up by the large bay window at the end of the hall an overstuffed armchair a coffee table scattered with magazines cigars and an ash tray the view was rather incredible i didntknow what rooms were on the 3rd floor and i wondered just how good the view from the windows up there was from this window you could see over the neighbours roof and most others it was as if you could sit here at this huge bay window and watch the world pass you by i dontrecall how i got to the end of the hallway but i did it was as if that window that little nook so different from the rest of the house was alluring there was some picturesque feel to it to how you could see the moon the stars the navy sky so well by just standing there looking out of it it was a bright night the moon was on it way to being full there wasnta wisp of a cloud in the sky but there was grey smoke floating from chimney all over there was no wind there was absolutely nothing to disturb this night it was clear and vivid and maybe one of the favourite nights of my life but it was so very cold that night standing by jude car at the train station startled me out of my hazy state it almost robbed you of your breath how cold the air was and when you did breathe it was a cloud of frosty white vapour i was realizing or remembering all of this as i sat in one of the armchairs staring nay gaping out of the window with james slowly progessing down the hall to stand behind the chair your room is the one across the hall from my own directly across from it all your stuff in it i going to hit the sack it been a long day i didntsay anything until i heard him turn and head to his room james yeah lil i turned around in the chair to look at him one hand in his front pocket and the other rubbing the back of his neck why this here the chairs and coffee table he looked at me and i watched his jaw tighten before he smiled i really didntthink he was going to answer me sometimes i forgot who he was and sometimes i expected him to fully let me in and tell me every single thing i want to know but he was still james we liked it looking out over the houses remus isntallowed to smoke in any of the rooms so he chose the hallway and that window kinda the window some nights you can see the world pass by i finished for him in a quiet tone turning back to look out of the window yeah lil i his unfinished statement hung heavy in the air for a few moments i was desperate to hear him say it i didntknow what he was going to say but it was like i did i wanted him to offer a declaration of surprise at how i finished his sentence and how it has happened before and how it must ve meant something the two of us taking words from the others mouth he didntsay it but he would have he would have goodnight lil lil where did lil come from lily was all that usually fell from his mouth hell at one point all i heard was evans lil my full name was not lillian despite what most people thought it was lily lily rhoslyn evans nobody gave me nicknames i was just lily you know i was just one of those people my name could easily be shortened to a nickname but nobody ever bothered they preferred to throw my last name out there until the marauders lil lils darling i stood up after a few minutes perhaps 10 my breathing betraying me and becoming quick as i thought of james potter and how my mind sometimes spun and moved nearer to the window my face hovering quite close to the clear glass my breath quickly fogged it up and i could feel the cold from the glass floating off to meet my warm cheeks i pressed a fingertip to the window and it was a soothing sort of cool i suddenly felt very awake opposed to a minute earlier when i could ve slept in that armchair the whole night i sighed and turned to go to the room james had pointed out to be mine while i was there that window hung like a canvas between our two rooms i didntknow what i wanted right now at the moment but i need to say it bid it repeat it to him goodnight james it not that hard lily james are you awake it may have been 15 minutes since he departed for his bedroom and it was almost 2 in the morning i stood just on the other side of the bedroom door waiting for a response from somewhere in the dark mmm i am come in shut the door the bedroom was dark the only bit of light coming in was from the open door i shut it despite and after a moment my eyes adjusted to the dark and i could faintly make out a form in the room that i assumed was his bed can i ask you a question i asked coming to stand near it of course are you awake because i woke you or are you awake because you couldntget to sleep i couldntsee him smile but i could hear it in his voice when he next spoke the slight amusement in his voice yeah he was smiling and in my mind it looked nice i am awake because i couldntget to sleep why are you awake same reason mmm lil i swallowed and attempted to focus my eyes in the direction his voice was coming from yeah do you feel suddenly very awake i laughed briefly and offered him a nod though he was blind to it it rather strange but yes yeah me too i could hear him shifting and i was searching for the tiniest bit of light somewhere in the room the crack beneath the door the cracks in the window not covered by the blind being completely engulfed by pitch black darkness makes me panic or something it cold in here i muttered folding my arms around myself and fumbling my way towards the window i pulled the blind up a bit letting the moon spill it light into the room and then looked over to james bed i know it freezing i could see him now pulling the covers down on the side of the bed he wasntlaying on he sprawled across the bed and reached for his wand on his stand laying back on his side he lit the wand and told me to close the blind it made the room feel colder he said and for some reason he was right come lay down lil he said through a yawn laying his wand on the bed between both the pillows and offering a bit of a warm glow i didntsay anything i wasntreally hesistant about laying next to him just curious was all curious why his offer didntmake me feel a bit more uncomfortable or aware of how comfortable the two of us were becomng i looked him over and smiled letting my arms fall from around me he had on a long sleeved grey shirt and from what i could tell a pair of plaid pajama pants and socks james always slept in socks he didntlike the feel of his feet directly against the bed sheet especially when it was cold out i however was still in my jeans and sweater and was without socks as i had pulled them off before coming over to his room the sound of the comforter and sheets rustling as i bunched them into my hand and pulled them up until i was under them was the single nicest sound i had heard that night it just sounded real and inviting against the cold of the room and james warm warm eyes never leaving me as i climbed in helped too never thought i d get you in bed so soon he grinned at me as i pulled the covers up to my chest and lay my arms overtop of them i smiled at him and scrunched my nose up for a second typical boy ah but in a day i ll be a man i rolled my eyes and we shared a quiet laugh before drifting off into silence i heard james inhale deeply and release it slowly he was laying on his back his arms folded behind his head if i asked you right now in this moment what do you want for the rest of your life would you be able to answer right now at 2 in the morning what is the one single thing you could live the rest of your life with feeling or doing i wasntsurprised at his question late night early morning confessions and conversations is just normal it became normal for me at least us we talked at night we spilled things at night we became who we were at night i want to wake up with someone next to me for the rest of my life lay with somebody at night talking til we fall asleep like this you know not be alone that all i want right now to not be alone james repeated looking at the ceiling and not to me i dontthink i ve ever thought of it not being alone i guess when your our age you dontreally i know most people dontconsider it i interrupted him and james laughed lightly but let me finish i almost afraid of it though plus i turned over onto my side looking at him while he looked away doesntthis feel nice unbelievably comforting james didntsay anything but slowly turned his face to look at me taking his arms from under his head and sprawling one head beside him the other hand was tracing over his right cheek yes was all he said in a soft murmur that made his lips move in a way that was unintentionally hot and he knew that i knew that he had considered what i was asking him whether laying here together laying here with me felt nice and unbelievably comforting i didntmean it like that i swear it a hundred times over that i just meant not being alone on a night so bright felt nice well it all i want for the rest of my life i whispered looking away from him and chewing a bit of my lip to be in my bed for the rest of your life he broke the moment of tender sincereity with that nice i looked back to him and shook my head slowly fighting a smile shut up and he grinned is that your foot we had been laying just preoccupying our thoughts with things and just listening to the other breathe where i asked a bit surprised at how completely random that was against my leg without a sock on it lily that disgusting i didntrealize james it not even touching your bare leg i scoffed after lifting the covers up and looking under it still lily i moved my foot up his pant leg and he almost jumped a mile he struggled to get away from me and i distracted him with tickling his neck furiously eventually after making enough noise to wake anybody on the floor up oh wait this was his own floor he grabbed my wrists and held them in one of his hands and was grinning wickedly at the way i couldntstop giggling now lily evans remove your foot from up my pant leg and i ll let you go i did so letting my toes drag along his skin the whole way and he released my wrists i wanted him to shudder in a revolted sort of way as i did this but he just looked at me getting himself comfortable on his side your feet are freezing so are my hands i told him raising both of them and touching them to his warm cheeks he looked down at my hands on his face and it almost looked like his eyes were shut the way his lids were but he looked back to me and tugged me nearer to him i curled my legs up and watched how he was with me putting a hand in my hair and stroking it for a moment he wasntcareful with me he didnttreat me like i was delicate and fragile and couldnthandle things the way he looked at me when these soft warm moments came about was with a great deal of respect and intrigue he seemed to want to make things better at times but he let me be independent always my own james have you ever i sighed not wanting to ask this question for i knew he would find it prying but curiousity got the better of me as it does the majority of humans it in our nature it what we do we just always need to know or have more have you ever been in love i had rolled away from him when i spoke and took my turn in staring at the ceiling he was quiet for a moment and sighed as well turning over onto his back again and staring at the ceiling along with me i had this girlfriend last year jo jocelyn was her full name and most people just called her joce i called her jo because i liked it and she eventually liked it i didntremember this girlfriend most of the ones he had were in gryffindor and he hadnthad that many that i d lose track or not recall them being with him in the common room november til the middle of june we were together that long about 7 months i guess she had straight long hair with these side swept bangs freckles along her cheeks and nose not a lot just enough her hair was a light strawberry blonde pretty blue eyes she was tiny he laughed his heh of a laugh for a moment and smiled slightly at this memory he was creating for the both of us 5 2 maybe not a hundred pounds i dontthink i dontknow she was just my opposite i all broad shouldered and tall and dark hair and she had this laugh that was unbelievably light you d think she didnthave a problem in the world i was briefly reminded of remus and how that laugh of his contrasted his personality she was a ravenclaw was i interrupted momentarily turning over onto my side and watching him as he talked yep she graduated last year oh that would explain me not knowing who she was she was older than you by about a year yeah i dontknow how we got together but i started acting older around her just to impress her i was right proud and cocky when she thought i was a 7th year last year she noticed me my life was lived y know i just had to let the rest fall into place and it did it completely did we were happy and together and she was pretty yeah she was pretty god i told her i loved her we were just sitting outside in february valentine day coming up it just worked for the quiet moment you know we both said it almost at the same time she kinda breathed it at me and i i almost choked and panicked but i said it back i said it back and that s the closest i came to being in love he didntlook anywhere but at the one spot on the ceiling as he spoke and i wasntsure whether or not he blinked the dim glow from the wand made it hard to tell but he was serious and soft spoken what do you mean the closest you came if you told her you loved her shut up lily stop asking questions i thought i meant it but when you re 16 17 you ll try to convince yourself of anything we might have been in love but i doubt it it may have been in love for that age you know the definitions and feelings change as you get older i was in like or infatuated or blinded or a combination of the three she flew high at me when it was some night at the first of june i decided i told her that i was not even close to being prepared for love in love she didntlike it me telling her i cared about her but was only 17 and not in love certainly not in love i said she was angry for a few days and didntspeak to me jo cried the next time we spoke she said i was right it was true we just wanted to be in love and it had been nice while it lasted lily she meant a lot to me and she forced me to grow up my head deflated a bit i may not have loved her but she was imporant to me he looked to me for a moment but looked back to the ceiling as he finished she owls sometimes i only reply now and then it hard i guess i over her and dontknow how to carry on a friendship after the emotional bloody wreck we put ourselves through and i done heh there was a smile on his face as he finished i didntpull my eyes away from him i had never seen him like this before i had never heard anything of this sort fall from his mouth and this was some sort of revelation for me some sort of realization hit me that james potter was letting me in so close that i could almost see what he was thinking i could almost touch him he wasnttoo far out of my reach it was shocking and dizzying and i was not sure how he would react to the huge smile on my face and the nervous or relieved laughter issuing from my mouth james hadntbeen in love but by the way he spoke it was like he was in love with love he wanted it so much and this was the first time that i discovered a boy like him could want such a thing a boy like him laying here with a girl like me not being in love with anyone that felt good he said quietly as if to nobody in particular after a moment of me just gazing at him trying to figure out his eyes his thoughts his glasses his just him in that time it did feel good i felt more alive right now than i had for weeks it seemed i didntknow what 5 00 looked like i dontwake up that early on purpose and i dontstay up that late given one exception but people wake up sometimes glance the clock look out the window and think oh hmph so this is what 5 00 looks like and never forget it but me i think i knew what 5 00 looked like in june a dim light washing over the sky a weak morning making itself known the sun rose near 5 o clock in june and it was so spectacular you dontwant to think it any other way that morning though december 20th was nothing like june 5 o clock it was almost quarter after when i woke up slowly realizing where i was and with whom and it was dark the sky was black and offered no hint of a morning not far off it was confusing almost some people were getting up at 5 30 to be off to work this dark listless sky would be the beginning of their day the beginning of anybody day really the sun didntrise in december until almost 8 and it was so slow at doing so that you didntnotice anything remotely beautiful about it i stretched myself into awareness and rolled over onto my left side i had been laying on my right side and was facing the direction of the bedroom door and there james was i really did fall asleep next to him a half pass two 2 and a half hours ago it seemed like all night i was awake and my eyelids werenthurting like they had been before everything was quiet i could hardly hear his breathing just saw his chest rise and fall slowly there was some tantilizing comfort in the wee hours of the morning for it hardly seemed like morning but it felt like it couldntbe anything but i held my breath for a moment watching his eyelids flutter a bit and i wondered whether or not he was actually sleeping avid dreamer are you james i muttered in the direction of him as his lids fluttered about some more and i heard that only happened if you were either awake or dreaming no just waiting to see whether or not you re going to go back to sleep he muttered back to me in the same tone his eyes still shut but a little smirk on his lips i grinned and my chapped lips hurt as i did so i dug around in my jean pocket looking for my lip chap while simply observing him his eyes remained closed and he took deeper louder breaths almost sounding like sighs he had fell asleep laying on his side facing me and his arm was sprawled out over the space between the two of us almost touching my waist his glasses were askew and his fringe was sticking up almost straight those hazel green of his pulled open just as i took the cover from my lip chap and smoothed it over my lips rubbing them together and soothing the raw spots on them instantly and his gaze was on my lips as i did so i forgot what 5 o clock looked like i said softly scooting closer so i could see out of the window across the room from his point of view me too i thought perhaps he might find it odd that i would even know what it looked like but god june nights at the end of the school year could lead to all sorts of things last june me jada and a couple of other girls just didntbother going to sleep the last night we were at hogwarts for 6th year we stayed up til 5 am and watched the sun rise that the only time you ve seen it rise at 5 ah i ve seen it rise both ways going to bed and getting up i ve never really remembered it all i know is that it light and nice and for a second everything quite breath taking mmm boys dontappreciate sunrises unless they re with pretty girls and they automatically compare the girls beauty to the sunrises james looked away from the window and at me he smiled and held my stare for a moment well there no sunrise to compare you to so are you still expecting something i laughed lightly and shook my head no halfway through smiling broader he stopped and furrowed his brow at me i could see his forehead because of that stuck straight up fringe and i could see the couple of shallow creases on it i guess he expected a joking reply of yes so perhaps he could give something too bad he breathed out in a deep voice you re as lovely as the sunrise in june the corniest damn thing i d probably ever hear him say but i shook my head in spite of myself and smiled til my cheeks hurt you ass i laughed at the look of amused shock on his face i just i trailed off at a loss for words he shifted moving his head off of the pillow so that it was on an angle near my shoulder some of my shoulder was exposed as my sweater had pulled to one side as i turned over and when james let out a sigh it was just him breathing a soft warm breath onto my skin i allowed my eyes to flutter shut and listen to his mesmerizing voice say his mesmerizing things i tired was all he said for a moment and i glanced him shutting his eyes his face still close to my shoulder and have i told you yet that i glad you came home with me if not i am i glad lily he sighed again and his breath hit my shoulder and i took a soft intake of breath holding it til he had finished there ve been times in the past couple of weeks that i wish i had more profound things to say to you but i ve got absolutely nothing you re one of my best friends and i like how you finish my sentences i smiled and opened my eyes turning to look at him as he pulled his head back up to the pillow you re a charming bastard i do know that he offered a hazy eyed smile at this i should go to my own room do your parents wake up early he nodded his features tired but a small smile still on his lips he had been smiling a lot more lately it was nice you ll meet mum in a few hours i guess james yawned and ran a hand over his face she overwhelming lily i nodded fully prepared to take whatever on right then i couldntimagine her being unpleasant i ll see you goodnight i scrunched my nose up and laughed as i didntknow what to say before departing the bedroom good morning james replied his arms folded behind his head and he yawned again i climbed out of my warm place in the bed next to james and crossed the dark room noting with a bit of amusement that the wand was still lay lit on the pillows looking over at him again before opening the door crossing the hall and entering the bedroom that was mine for my stay i didnteven look around or turn a light on as i went into the large room and threw myself down onto the bed my stomach felt like it was flying as i considered meeting mrs potter and perhaps this melly girl more formally in a few hours i grinned to myself and was convinced it would be fine they ll adore you and i believed him james had that way about him he didntlie and he told the truth well they ll adore you they ll adore me mrs potter nice to meet you they ll adore you at 8 30 that morning i found that those three words that simple lovely statement was a lie like no other abc chapter 11 coming apart when a mother loves her daughter it is a bond that cannot be broken it unconditional it incredible and nobody is closer than mother daughter when a father loves his daughter he overly protective and grounds her too often because he doesntwant his little girl to grow up he got a strange way of showing it but the daughter knows it out of love when a father loves his son it like having a best friend and a worst enemy he there for you and will understand the teenage years better than your mother but when you make mistakes he ll come down on you hard because he knows you should know better ah but when a mother loves her son it different from all the others when a mother loves her son she may do absolutely anything to ensure his happiness she will hate every girl that steps into his life except for the one she hand picks for him she will love his friends if only to keep an eye on what goes on and she will be the sweetest person in the world when he around but hate you so much when he turns his back all to make sure that her son gets the best of everything gets what she thinks is best sometimes a mother is blinded by her love for her little boy there are of course exceptions to every statement above i personally donthave that bond with my mother i do have the over protective father yeah there are exceptions but mrs potter was no exception to the mother and son statement when i woke that morning it was grey just point blank grey a dark grey it was as if the sun had started to rise but was clouded instantly by thick fog and typical london weather it had rained that morning christmas was days away and it had rained any thin blanket of snow away i sighed and blinked myself awake the room was gorgeous big nicer than my own room at home richly coloured mahogany furnishings and the bathroom off of it was just as nice sparkling white and beautiful i grinned and ran a hand back through my hair i was still in my clothes from the day before and looked quite disheveled some mascara had flaked off my lashes down below my eyes and i wiped it away before pulling my sweater off and picking out a pajama top all of my clothes had been packed away in the dresser and i hoped to god they had house elves or something i honestly hoped it hadntbeen mrs potter going through my suitcase and putting my knickers away how bloody embarrassing the carpet was a deep wine colour and i felt almost out of place in this room that just screamed everything that the potter were nicely defined stature flawless on the outside i was convinced at this time that nothing could go wrong and the morning would be lovely and i even felt comfortable in my pajamas considering going around the house in them i had doubted it earlier whether or not it would be acceptable i didntknow what to say think eat or wear i didntwant to ask james for pointers on how to win his family over but perhaps a bit of a warning more than my mum overwhelming would ve been nice i splashed water onto my face quickly brushed my teeth and combed my hair with my fingers as i pulled the door to the bedroom open it was almost 8 30 and i didntknow if anybody was up or not because this floor was so bloody quiet the floor below it was his parents lexi s and the floor above well i didntknow yet 3 upstairs floors and counting the main level 4 floors who needs a house that big my socks padded quietly on the wood floor until i stepped onto the mat and not even my footsteps could be heard the door to james bedroom was ajar and i peered inside before continuing downstairs i didntreally see anything but his blind was pulled and no light not even the grey light of this morning was entering in it i hoped he was up i took my time making my way down the two sets of stairs until coming into the entrance hallway i paid close attention to every little detail making mental notes of where certain rooms were and stuff like that everytime i walked by a mirror or something i could sort of see my reflection in i ran my hands through my hair like crazy taking a deep breath i poked my head into the den and quickly looked around then crossed the hall to the left side and looked into the living room and there was the door to the kitchen a swinging door painted white i just had to walk straight past the staircase and just push the door open for a moment they didntnotice me all i did was watch them decked out in what could ve been their sunday finest lexi was wearing a dress for christ sake mr potter was reading the paper he had a tie on with his white button down that melly girl the nextdoor neighbour she was there her hair was in two braids and she was wearing a turtleneck sitting at the table with mr mrs potter sipping from a dainty looking teacup smiling broadly i cleared my throat and stepped forward into the kitchen the room wasnthuge but well sized the dining room was off to the right of it just through a large archway the kitchen seemed to contrast with the rest of the house almost blinding white whereas the rest of the house was deep and old fashioned the linoleum flooring was white with green accents the cupboards were white as well and the knobs on the doors were green a pale almost sea foam green the table was made of a light coloured wood the legs painted white and there was a bowl of fruit in the middle of the table as i cleared my throat i caught mr potter attention and he offered me a cheeky grin lily ah good morning dani mrs potter had just gone into the dining room and jude called her back over dani this is lily the one of whom you insisted james bring home the woman who i had heard so much about the woman who james said bought me christmas presents and wanted him to bring me home the woman who was like a mother to sirius and remus that woman who had that 5 year old daughter that woman who james adored so much mrs danielle potter she didntsmile at me she came and stood next to the table laying a hand on her husband shoulder she cast a glance in melly direction and then looked back to me her eyes were narrowed in some sort of curious oh so this is her way she looked as if she was trying to smile trying to make the corners of her mouth turn up but halfway there her lips would fall back to a straight line and she d purse her lips looking puzzled or thoughtful i saw her eyes scan up and down my pajama clad form and i shut my eyes briefly realizing what a prat i must ve looked like in this sparkling clean kitchen with them in their neat nice clothes i um my voice caught in my throat and i was forced to clear it again bringing the attention of melly and lexi to me tugging on the sleeve of my candy cane pajama top i went to speak again just wanted to come meet you mrs potter before uh i had a shower honestly all of the obsessing yesterday about what to wear and i play the fool and show up at breakfast james clearly missing in my freaking pajamas i stood there smiling like an idiot hoping mrs potter would say something slowly she smiled and nodded nice to meet you lily she didntstep closer and offer me a hand to shake nor did she tell me to call her dani or danielle or something of the sort she just stood with her hand on her husband shoulder clutching it rather tightly you ve met melly and lexi then i nodded and to prove i really was a nice girl i smiled at melly well dontlet us keep you from your shower then breakfast will still be on the table when you re done drowning myself i thought bitterly as i left the kitchen my shower didnttake long at all and neither did picking out an outfit suddenly the need to appear perfect had vanished and it was only about 10 after 9 when i stood in the full length mirror staring at my appearance i looked nice i thought i didntbother with mascara just curled the lashes my cheeks didntneed blush as they seemed stained red at the moment i smoothed on a subtle pink lipgloss and my hair fell down my back in pretty waves and it smelled good i wore a green v neck sweater with a white camisole underneath because we all know how vixen like i turned the last time i wore a v neck around james and a pair of dark blue jeans they just seemed classier than faded ones and i stood there with a solemn sticken look on my face like i couldntbring myself to smile now i was in shock almost they ll adore you he said my mum not like that he said they wontcare what you re wearing james said this was supposed to be good from start to finish christmas was supposed to be happy because this was a fresh start a family i didntknow but so badly wanted to i wanted to make good impression i cared to make a good impression mr potter seemed nice enough as did lexi but mrs potter was hostile towards me and i was only in the kitchen for 5 minutes at the most it had something to do with that pretty brunette melly it had to have december always was horrible always always always my parents sent me money i sent them cards my sister and i didntbuy one another anything we hardly acknowledged the other exsisted my grandparents usually sent me money along with a card just to make it more personal i hadntbeen home in years my dad liked his potential new family better and i leave the bloody castle for the first christmas in awhile and it rains and i wear pajamas and the way she looked at me just screamed you re not good enough you re not good enough you re not good enough but the thing that got me was that james said and repeated that she was the one who insisted i come she knew who i was my family situation apparently and i hoped she knew that james me were just friends and i had no intentions of stealing the spotlight from little miss melly at 9 30 me sitting in the armchair at the little nook at the end of the hallway when james emerged from his room i was a bit more than a little pissed off at him he didntrealize i was there at first but halfway down the hall he stopped turned back and looked to the armchair i was sitting in oh good you re up he grinned at me as he came back towards me and stood next to the chair didntwant to go down to breakfast alone i swallowed and folded my arms over my chest staring out of the wide window no but i did anyway i looked up at him from out of the corner of my eye and saw him frown down at me what d you mean instead of answering him i just chewed my lip and sunk lower in the chair curling my legs up in it as well how old melly i asked quickly uh 20 turned it in august why james sat down in the armchair that was to the left of the one i was sitting in and at the same time we both plopped our feet onto the glass top coffee table no reason and i would ve wanted to hit me if i were him i didntwant to go whining on about his mum seeming hostile and cold towards me because i had only been around her for a minute and i didntwant to go throwing questions about melly left and right because he might get the wrong idea the sad thing was i didnteven know what the wrong idea was for him to think i wouldntlike melly because she had known him for his whole life and spent every summer with him and the marauders and i wanted that or for him to think that i wouldntlike melly because mrs potter wouldnthave room to like me i just i didntwant december to suck i really really so badly wanted to let this month go out as good as it began i wanted christmas to be incredible and i wanted to smile i wanted so desperately to smile at christmas morning what going on lily he asked after a moment as we both stared out the window into the grey morning that mere hours ago was black and mere hours ago we were waking up to 5 00 together nothing i just i went down there to breakfast in my bloody pajamas yeah after all the fretting over what to wear i dontknow i just felt too comfortable i guess and your dad smiled at me and called your mum over to meet me and she just i trailed off pausing for a moment and then that that melly girl was there too and lexi was eating toast and she had a dress on at 8 30 in the morning for christ sake i feel so stupid i bemoaned putting my face into my hands and refusing to look at james because i knew he was looking at me did somebody say something james asked carefully and i looked at him out of the corner of my eye he was bent over his elbows propped up on his knees and his fingertips placed together resting against his upper lip he looked pensive or worried or something no but dontyell at me for this but i took a breath and shook my head in spite of myself your mum just looked disappointed when she saw me james said nothing for a moment just stayed in the position he was in looking calm and thoughtful the corners of his lips quirked into some sort of sad smile a smile of pity a smile that denied me any grace a smile that showed just what sorry case i came off as lily honestly how long were you down there for i shrugged and most likely looked as if i was pouting as i drew my knees up to my chest and tried to bury my face away in the crevices of the chair i dunno 5 minutes i sighed shakily as he stood and shoved his hands into the pockets of his plaid pajama pants he wore a navy sweatshirt with them but his pajamas would be acceptable because a he was their son and b they didnthave candy canes on them c mon lil give it a chance i know christmas point blank has been terrible for you before i ve decided to try my hardest to make this christmas worthy to you so just dontbe so paranoid because you are you realize you re paranoid as hell when it comes to what people think of you come with me now please he extended one of his hands to me the other still tucked in his pocket and i didntwant to take it because i d rather just give him the cold shoulder until he realized i wasntinsane and trying to make the worst out of everything but had i not taken it i would ve just stayed sitting there curled up in that armchair for the rest of the break his hands were cool to touch and his knuckles were awfully battered up from playing qudditch in the cold weather a couple held dry patches and had cracked leaving a covering of dry blood my fingertips brushed one of his sore knuckles as we reached the second set of stairs and he took a sharp breath and stopped walking he pulled his hand away from mine and drew in air through his teeth making a quiet hissing sound you ve got bloody sharp nails evans he muttered blowing on the skin i had scratched that was sure to be stinging as blood found it way out of the mess of dry and cracked skin and he called me evans i stared at him as he stared at his hand looking much too intriguied with that fucking scratch his lips formed an o as he blew cool air onto his knuckle wipe the blood off of it first potter i said at him with clenched teeth and my lips barely moving he did so despite my tone of voice and peered down at his dry skin do you know any charms for this he asked gesturing at his roughened knuckles i do yeah i nodded turned on my heel and walked away james watching me all the while for the second time that morning i arrived in the entrance hallway mere feet away from the kitchen door yet again i stared at it and while doing so i heard james footsteps on the long set of stairs he had waited a moment before following after me so instead of entering the kitchen and facing what i thought at that point would be the end of james and me our friendship i leaned against the wall and waited for him to reach the end of the stairs and spot me standing there you change pages quicker than i can keep up with i recalled saying almost the same thing to him one day that was funny though how you storm off but then wait for me anyway because you re too what are you too scared to go to breakfast without me you cant be like this all break this cantgo on you re going to have to give it a chance i pursed my lips and pushed myself off of the wall following him into the kitchen 15 minutes later i was standing leaning against the counter with my plate of toast in one hand and a piece of toast in the other james sat at the table along with mrs potter lexi and melly mr potter had excused himself not long after we entered the kitchen there were only 4 chairs at the small round kitchen table which made sense i suppose they only used the kitchen table for breakfast and otherwise ate in the dining room so when james offered me the last chair and mrs potter sent him then me a glance i declined and just awkwardly stood there nibbling on the cold toast it was some kind of metaphor maybe not really but for that moment it was to me james was defensive of his family and it was surprising because for most of the time we had been friends he had been defensive of me in whatever it was he spoke to me words of pity at times but when he did so before today it was somehow with respect it was in a defensive comforting way and when i stood next to him feeling awkward and lesser than he his arm would come around me and pull me close defending me to the person he was speaking to reassuring me that he was there but now he wasntstanding next to me he wasntreassuring me and making me feel less awkward i was standing to the side not involved in their conversation and the toast was cold soggy almost lily would you like a cup of tea mrs potter asked in a voice all sugar sweet and it quickly brought me from my reverie a bit too quickly in fact the plate i was holding slipped from my hand and i dropped the remainder of my toast on the floor in the rush to grab the plate had mrs potter not turned around in her chair and had her wand in her hand the glass plate would ve crashed but she waved her wand saying an incantation and the plate floated to the counter just before it hit the floor another wave of her wand and the toast i had dropped disappeared my hands were at my sides rigidly and my eyes were fluttering about begging to shut and close myself off from these people tea yes yes please i pressed my lips tightly together as she pursed her own and drew her thin eyebrows in a bit of a frown i looked to the pretty tea cups and saucers that mrs potter melly had i sorry you just startled me she said nothing but waved her wand again and the tea appeared on the counter thank you i said quietly picking the mug up and holding it in both of my hands the mug the tea was in was heavy and white and there was faded blue on the front as if there had been writing there i felt snubbed and rightly so their teacups had flowers and a pretty little handle for you to daintily grasp and just as i took a sip of my tea melly rose her teacup in front of her for a moment before taking a long sip from it i decided not to like her even if she did seem exceedingly sweet i wasntgoing to like her because i was trying so bloody hard to fit in here and it wasntworking and her being so pretty brunette and holding the love of mrs potter wasnthelping melly had eyes as blue as the sky and silky straight brown hair that was longer than mine the highlights that shone through it when the light bounced the right way were absolutely darling she was slim and seemed to be without trying to be everything about her was delicate and just pretty her french manicured fingernails her long legs her pretty laugh and the way both james mrs potter were so attentive to everything she said and did we had been in the kitchen for probably an hour and i was still standing there trying to listen to their quiet conversation and not succeeding the only time i properly heard anything was when lexi giggled or spoke loudly my left leg had a cramp in it my right foot was asleep my lower back hurt from being pressed against the edge of the counter for so long and i had chewed my chapped bottom lip so much that it began bleeding i had my arms folded over my chest and james had not looked my way for 20 minutes so it was surprising when he spoke of me yes christmas should be brilliant i excited especially because lily here my gaze was narrowed and sharp as i stared at him when i first heard the mention of christmas but soon softened as i heard his statement she not had a proper one in ages i guess and i want it to be he never got the chance to finish because mrs potter cut him off by turning in her chair to be able to face me again your parents are divorced yes how old are they i stared at this woman and her tried innocent expression she wasntfooling me yes they ve been divorced since i was a little girl my mum 37 and my dad 38 mrs potter eyebrows rose and she didntblink for a moment oh my that quite she trailed off and her eyes moved towards james then back to me young i finished the sentence for her gaining james gaze as well well yes christmas we should go shopping at around 1 today at diagon alley melly will you be coming oh i just hope the weather brightens up a bit i stopped hearing what mrs potter was saying as i set my mug down and folded my arms staring right back at him he hadntlooked away when his mother drew attention to me and i noted that he and his father had the same colour eyes lexi had mrs potter wide blue innocent eyes mrs potter didntlook her age i realized as i stood there staring at her back turned to me her hair was curly and as white as the snow that was slowly being rained off of the streets it almost touched her shoulders and it was hard to imagine she ever had a different hairstyle she had some laugh lines and i sure had the occasional bag beneath her eye but she looked good for over 50 she was too tall i thought probably only an inch shorter than her not quite 6 feet husband she was too proud as well even more proud than jude you could tell sure if you had the potter name you should wear it well but she wore it too well at times her own family was pureblood as well but not as honoured in the ministry as the potter s and much more humble than the potter s i found in the months or years to come that she felt lucky to have gotten to where she was now to give the potter name a feminine graceful touch she just wasntalways the best at showing how appreciative she was of her husband and his wealthy wealthy family it was at 10 30 when mr potter voice could be heard booming throughout the house requesting the presence of his two children upstairs that james left me alone with only his mother melly come here for a second he said to me as lexi tugged his hand and tried to pull him out of the kitchen i went over to him by the door and folded my arms again looking at him expectantly this is probably just about mum christmas presents i ll be back in a few minutes just try to behave i may have smiled if his tone of voice had been different but he sounded way too serious for my liking i raised my eyebrows and stared at him behave right i ll try i chewed my lip again as he allowed himself to be pulled from the room and he sighed at me before the door swung shut asshole i murmured before turning back round to face the other two i sighed and found myself leaning against the wall next to the door just observing mrs potter all deep in conversation with her next door neighbour daughter so where did you go to school at melly i asked loudly not bothering to hide my rather broody expression i assumed she came from a wizarding family oh beauxbaton s melly responded kindly smiling at me yes she rather fluent in french mrs potter added with some kind of false accent ah and what are you doing now melly oh melly tucked one of her braids behind her ears and nodded once as she thought i plan on becoming a teacher i ve just got a few courses left to take and i should be all set until then i just babysitting for the potter s she laughed lightly and sipped from her teacup that had been refilled twice i see i said giving melly a quick quirk of my lips just as mrs potter opened her mouth to speak the swinging door pushed open and someone walked by me so fast that i didntcatch who it was until they had swooped down to hug mrs potter it was of course i thought in that moment sirius who didntnotice me leaning against the wall just by the door that swinging was slowing i met melly eyes for a moment and pouted my lips out staring at the back of sirius head as he then turned to melly and hugged her i couldntthink of anything to say you know lily i assume mrs potter said in an uneven voice it was as if she was trying to sound both pleasant and exasperated at once and the result was a warbly voice that may belong to a woman of 30 years older than her sirius turned around to follow mrs potter gaze and he tilted his head at me giving a smile that i was so thankful to see cantsay i do perhaps you should introduce us i saw mrs potter shake her head and give her eyes a roll what the hell sirius melly laughed i was wondering what the point of that was too not an idea it a bit early dontyou think dani darling doing anything special for james birthday no no he doesntwant a big deal i mean he ll be legal tomorrow allowed to do magic but nope he doesntwant a party so he not going to get one he had a big enough to do over his birthday last year 8 o clock sound good then sirius faced mrs potter again and he grinned at her honestly sirius we re not doing anything giving him gifts i suppose you guys can come over yes sirius nodded good remus wontbe over today i not supposed to be here technically if i want to be the good friend and not ditch him but he got gift buying to finish up me i don t so i all yours all day we re leaving to finish up shopping at 1 mrs potter informed him dryly with a small smirk oy then i all yours til 1 he was standing near me and pushed the door open with one hand holding it and looking to me lily and i have some conversation to catch up on i ll be right there he nodded and left the kitchen i just wanted to i just wanted to rub in mrs potter face how nice i could be how nice i was going to be how i was going to make it impossible for her to be cold to me i just wanted to be sweet and exactly what she expected when she told james to invite me over for the holiday s i was going to be even more girl next door ish than the girl next door melly i just wanted to thank you mrs potter for allowing me into your home and extending your warmth and hospitality you dontknow how much i sure it means to me i smiled the sweetest smile i could muster and even managed a tearful expression before turning and leaving the kitchen i didntwant to be like this but i had no idea what i was doing i didntwant to be some sarcastic bitch but i didntknow how else to be not to this woman i could i could be nice and decent to melly for she was genuinely sweet and it showed i hated it but it showed but mrs potter was intimidating she was james mum and like a mum to sirius so if i messed this up which at the moment i felt like i was likely to do i would be screwed there would be nothing with either of the marauders hi i found sirius a few minutes later up in the hallway of james floor situated in the armchair i had been sitting in earlier that morning hey lily he was sprawled out and his feet were plopped onto the coffee table i sat down in the matching armchair next to his and curled up in it slipping my hands between my knees in order to keep them warm and to keep me from biting my nails we stared out the window for a moment realizing the grey world of december and me growing to hate it more like i did every year and as usual i was being insensitive in my thoughts i dontknow how the fact that sirius basically had no family always slipped my mind i was always so down on myself when it came to my family when he had a bunch of dark magic nutters running through his blood it a bit of a cycle i think i ll have fallen into i love holidays and hate my family my family hates holidays and claims to love me mrs potter loves holidays and loves james so mrs potter will hate me and make me hate holidays slowly sirius turned his head to look at me and he raised a single eyebrow to me how the hell does that all relate i dunno i put my face into my hands and tugged the roots of my hair i was just trying to find a smooth way to slip mrs potter hating me into casual conversation sirius smiled and i turned to sit sideways and cross legged in the chair so i could see him still callin her mrs potter eh there must be something wrong then i sighed and watched him expectantly waiting for him to say more what he asked of my stare oh well dani hating you mmm i sure she does i opened my mouth to utter some sort of defiant remark but i was sure she did too do you want to know why lily not really i muttered moodily preoccupied with staring at my hands it because melly lived next door forever melly parents and james parents are the best of buddies melly is pretty melly is only 2 years older than james mrs potter adores melly and we ve all known her forever it was funny how he started on the subject of melly first thing when i hadnteven mentioned it but i suppose it was all over my face or something and then you walk in melly got pretty eyes but your are stunning melly got nice hair but your is nicer melly got a gorgeous smile but her doesnteven compare to yours melly known james her whole life and you ve known him really known him for mere months but you know more about him than she does probably you ve probably had the chance to dig deeper lily and a mum can see that sort of shit melly walks into a room and she captivates every damn guy in it except for james remus and myself because she like a sister you walk into a room you capitivate every damn guy in it including james remus and myself sirius took a breath and i was no longer staring at my hands no i was very much staring at him and you may think but you guys are just my friends yeah but james doesntlet people in he let you in he tells you things you ve taken the spot as best friend he captivated remus a moody bitch sometimes but only to those who bother him and those who bother him are those who get under his skin and that us the marauders and you no girl has made him so pms y so you ve captivated him and me i can only assume i dontneed to tell you how you captivate me jesus just by looking at me and when you do i dontwant to blink and then my eyes are stinging like something awful but i just cantlook away from you because earning a stare from you is like i had leaned over the small space between our chairs and crashed my lips onto his own cutting off his run on sentence and relieving both of us what he said was so desperately beautiful that i couldnthelp myself the way he made me sound was so unbelievable that my mind was on some kind of overload i wasntlike that i didntcaptivate being james friend and pissing remus off wasntcaptivating sirius hadntsaid anything about my friendship with james for awhile he hadntmentioned hadntasked things but he just assumed now that i had taken the role of best friend we didnttalk about james and i didntsay james and me were close but he knew he knew somehow that james did open up to me and that we were best friends or something as equally corny and he knew that remus didntreally like me sirius had just been playing oblivious maybe james was just playing oblivious too maybe he really knew what was going on with sirius me and there was no need to inform him of the something like a romance the two of us were persuing i hoped that was the case anyway to tell you the truth i couldntthink straight with sirius lips on mine there was something there this time around that hadntbeen before some passion lacing through it that we had so lacked before and that i had feared i would lack for the rest of my life passion i didntthink i was able to hold it i was so listless about some things there was nothing i was extreme over when i liked people that was just it i just liked them and falling hopelessly in love seemed impossible for me when i hated people it really wasntso i was unable to hate because i didnthave any blazing flashes of rage kissing sirius was giving me some sort of half hearted hope that maybe i was passionate maybe i was i felt sirius put a hand on my cheek after a moment of my lips being on his own and he pulled me a bit further into the kiss it was the kiss my mouth had been begging for since the first one it was me finally demanding a bit more it was him letting out a small sound as i gently bit his bottom lip it was him taking the initiative and deepening the kiss something he had done many times before and something i had not experienced my stomach soared with some sort of emotion i didntrealize i was capable of and having his tongue finding it way into my mouth was something i had been longing for yet i didntexpect this the warmth it brought caused my head to lurch forward in surprise and we parted only a moment after this yeah so i going to do that more often sirius murmured in one breath that issued over my cheeks as his calloused thumb rubbed the skin for a moment he pulled his hand back and slowly did the same with his face do what i asked talking quietly as well for i did not want him to hear how heavy my breathing was compliment you in a rambling sort of way i stared at sirius with his shaggy brown hair and those grey blue eyes and his somehow fuller bottom lip i stared at this 17 year old boy who i had just kissed senseless and thought about how there was always something new about him some different dangerous territory to explore each day i found us together his eyes were it today his eyes were changed darker if that was possible given the colour they held something i had always knew he had passion intense utterly evolved passion he had the passion he gave that kiss the passion i had kissed him but it turned around to him kissing me he is sirius black and there is no denying that lily he d always have some power over you over everyone he d always be better stronger and even nicer than you he d always laugh understandingly because he was like that he is sirius black and what the hell are you doing with him i blinked myself from my thoughts for i had been staring at him a bit too long and he had begun to frown oh sirius i sighed leaning back into the chair and shutting my eyes we re quite the pair he reached a hand out and traced his fingertips over the palm of my hand before standing up and leaving me alone i ll be in the kitchen lily and yes we are 1 o clock that day came and went but mostly it came i had no choice but to accomany the family along to diagon alley as i had shopping to finish up they decided we d floo directly to the leaky cauldron and sirius had left before lunch i hadntseen him again after i kissed him it was fine with me i didntthink we should be snogging off in dark corners of his best friend house anyhow and i didntwant to talk about it because i was afraid there was nothing to talk about when we everyone but jude lexi arrived in diagon alley everyone had a place to go so nobody was going to be together mrs potter went one direction melly another and james stood with me for but a moment before declaring he wanted to buy himself some qudditch supplies bloody hell i muttered to myself standing in the middle of the street between two shops of which i loved madam malkin robes for all occasions and florean fortescue ice cream parlor but neither looked appealing on this grey winter day the streets overcrowded with people buying christmas presents and me having no idea what i was doing here it had to have been about 5 degrees celcius unusually mild for this time of year but it was no surprise to me that the sky wasntfilled with snowflakes it was no surprise to me that the streets looked grubby with too many murky puddles lying about it was no surprise to me that the hem of the robes i was wearing for in the wizarding world you wear wizardry attire were sodden and muddy from me having trod on them a few times my feet were carrying me no where fast i just stood staring in a direction trying to make my mind work properly and think of the things i had to buy when it started raining a cold harsh rain me still standing in the same spot it was then i realized just how much was slowly changing in this world of magic me for one but i was least of it there was so much gone wrong and i was too blind to see it there was so much i missing and too naive stubborn to see it i swear to god that every person in diagon alley had an umbrella with them every last one of them almost in unison pulled an umbrella out from the folds of their cloaks and put them up hovering them over their heads protecting themselves from the december rain it was a sea of black in diagon alley at quarter after one in the afternoon for as far as i could see down the alley i saw black umbrellas i didnthave one i stood there soaked to the bone in only a minute my eyes were narrowed in order to see through the blinding rain i turned around heading back in the direction of the leaky cauldron i left the potter to their business and everyone else to their black umbrella s i went and caught a muggle bus the hell out of there abc chapter 12 hearts of controversy it wasnttwenty mintues and i was there but being there didntmake me feel anymore complete it didntfill some gap that was creating some emotional mess for me stepping off of the bus at the bus stop walking the short distance until i saw the street sign and easily finding the house did nothing to ease the fluttering in my stomach instead it just intensified until it was fluttering no longer it was some combination of dead weight being dropped down my throat some burning trying to rise from the pit of my stomach and some crashing wave of dizzying realization for sale everett realty land agents and the company phone number followed after this the thing that got me though was this was my house the sign looked weathered as if it had stood through a good few storms this month maybe even throughout november whatever the case was i knew it hadntjust been put there a day ago it had been there there had been time enough to contact me and let me know as shocking as it was the fact my mother would put the house up for sale without even letting me know i wasn t surprised it had never really been a home to me a house yes but not a home i hadntactually lived there since i was 11 hogwarts had been more of a home for me for almost 7 years and even when i was home during the holidays i spent the majority of my time at my grandparent home or at a friends house my grandparents the only set left living my dad parents lived in hastings a small seaside town it was different from where we lived the beach right there and this world no one else has we didntlive in the middle of the city but we lived in the nice suburbs in a nice house with a nice car and all that was missing for my whole childhood was the nice family my dad had moved out when my parents divorced and as far as i knew had a bachelor pad in the city unless he had moved in with rebecca or something and so my mum got the house and now it was for sale the rain hadntlightened any not that i was in any position to care now that my robes were so soaked with so much rain water that they were actually weighing me down some my purse hung from my shoulder and it was as if i had forgot about the small gold key that was always there but my hands did not they unzipped my purse and in an instant i was walking up the gravel driveway then climbing up the short set of wooden stairs and finally putting the key in the lock i turned it and i heard a click and then the door was open i twisted the knob and stepped into my house nobody was home of course my mum and petunia were off in america with the rest of their family it hadntbeen until recently that they left because a christmas tablecloth was on the table and other christmas decorations hung here and there so it not like they had moved out or anything nothing was out of place truthfully nothing ever really changed around here it was like taking a step back into time where the furniture never changed and the fridge was always full and the milk even sat in the same spot on the shelves in the fridge there were always chocolate chipit cookies and the kitchen always smelled nice continuing to give off that vibe that a nice unbroken family lived here it was as if the plants did not even change i felt 11 years old again and very well could have been home for the holidays decorations hanging it was almost perfect except there was no smell of pine because there was no tree up of course and there was no family home i unfastened the robes i was wearing and let them fall to the floor straightening the thin long sleeved black shirt i was wearing beneath them i began wandering through the house and it was almost sad how nothing i saw made me smile sad angry anything this was the home my mum had made for herself along with my sister this was the home i had so nervously left behind and years later became glad for it and even though nothing was packed and the pictures were still on the wall it was so very empty finding my wand in my purse i dried my clothes and robes and decided i d feel much more comfortable finishing my christmas shopping up in a muggle mall grab some coffee at a place in the mall maybe some supper remind myself who i was and where i came from and not to get too ahead of myself so that what i did not thinking about the events of the past day i just went about buying everything on my list a recipe book for mrs potter a new christmas themed teapot and tealights for mr potter it was a book on cars for he had enough cars i assumed he liked them and a box of rather expensive cigars i didntknow what to buy lexi sure she was a little girl and would be forced to like anything i bought her but she was also next to mrs potter the most brutally honest of the bunch so i bought her a barbie and a fluffy white blue eyed kitten a stuffed animal of course i was making a bad impression as it was i dontthink bringing a kitten home would go over big sirius didntwant to exchange presents i reminded myself with a frown and james was the only one left a bottle of cologne that i thought smelled the best a handbook on muggle football soccer just because i thought he might be interested and a grey sweatshirt sporting the logo of some british football team that i planned on magically changing to the name of his favourite qudditch team to replace the one i took from him and had no intentions on giving back and shopping took my mind off things for a bit made me feel a bit better not to mention i was in fact spending money of my mum i found laying on the counter at home it was 6 o clock that evening that i walked up the drive to my house again with a styrofoam cup of hot chocolate in hand i looked like hell but that was something i couldntobsess over at the moment my hair had gone unbelievably curly from the rain that had subsided just after i arrived at the mall and my clothes still felt damp after walking home through the heavy moist air when i walked into the house i dropped all of my bags onto the floor and kicked my shoes off i was just digging around in the freezer for some ice cream when headlights shone in the large window in the kitchen and i squinted against them as they blinded me ducking down i went over to the window and peeked out the curtains to see who had pulled up the fact of the matter was i had almost every light in the house on and the television turned up quite loudly so there was no pretending i wasnthome and as the driver and passenger side doors opened i realized that petunia was not in america at all what the hell are you doing here my sister was tall and thin with curly dirty blonde hair she could ve been pretty she almost was had her nose not been turned upwards towards the end of it and her neck not been so long neither of those things would matter of course if they didntsuit her perfectly she turned her nose up at anyone she thought wasntgood enough whether she knew them or not and she was such a prying person that the length of her neck assisted her in spying on the neighbours nice to see you too petunia i said dryly as she almost ran to the front door and flew it open her over weight boyfriend slowly coming behind she snapped her head around saw the boyfriend vernon put a foot on the bottom stair and then looked back to me look we re engaged she told me quickly extending her hand and showing off the diamond engagement ring i raised my eyebrows and opened my mouth to ask questions but the fianc had arrived beside petunia in the doorway vernon petunia said in a pleasant voice staring straight at me and holding my gaze as long as humanly possible this is my sister lily ah lily he held out a large hand and nearly crushed my own when he shook it i ve heard hardly anything about you but you seem to be a lovely person nice to finally meet you same to you nice to meet you finally i strained a smile and stepped back so they could enter the house petunia briskly walked past me and vernon was still smiling as he stepped into the house it obviously wasnthis first time here petunia jesus what the hell are you on i asked watching as she took her scarf from around her neck and shakily removed her gloves and craned her neck to apparently try to see every inch of the house i just didntexpect you was all i shut the door and then leaned against it folding my arms across my chest and pouting my lips as i watched my jumpy sister yeah well i didntexpect that for sale sign on the lawn deal with it i gave her a narrow eyed glance before going into the living room and stuffing my robes into one of my shopping bags it was easy to tell that petunia problem was my being a witch and unexpectedly home vernon didntknow and i wasntsurprised my sister hated the very thought of a world full of magic and magical people and magical creatues right from the beginning i dontknow if that was because she hated me right from the beginning or she was just too narrow minded whatever the case i knew she probably didnteven want to tell vernon i exsisted let alone the fact i lived in a world of talking furniture magic wands and the like for god sake lily put some clothes on petunia and vernon had taken off their jackets and winter wear and set them aside making themselves comfortable it seemed petunia was coming down the stairs having changed and threw me a black zip up sweater i have clothes on i looked down at the same jeans i had worn all day and the black shirt i had changed into to go shopping she scrunched her nose up as she settled herself down on one of the couches next to vernon in the largest room of the house the living room is the room we were in it was quite open and had quite a bit of furniture around it perimeter our house was so bland compared to james s white walls with wall paper boarder white carpet every room i almost swear was a combination of beige and white well your shirt too tight you still dress like a teeanger i am one i eighteen maybe you d have known that if you gave a shit thank mum when she comes back around too for the birthday wishes i folded my arms plunked down in an armchair and stared at the television that was on the evening news you cantgo showing up a few days before christmas and bitching about your problems how can you have any you ve been gone from home almost your whole life and you left us with all the problems vernon was looking rather uncomfortable as the inevitable argument with my sister began to simmer the explosion was the worst part of it i almost lived for the rush you get when you re in the midst of an argument and saying everything you ve been meaning to say your whole life it the most insane feeling in the world that what it is a feeling of brief insanity as you are absolutely free of your torturing thoughts the boiling of the argument was when everything got out into the air and you stood your tallest and stood your ground something rushed through your veins that felt so good you d continue arguing for the rest of your life just to know you re capable of shouting that loudly and making sense while doing so but whatever ran through your veins extracted just as quickly and you were left with some empty feeling that you d wish upon nobody not even the one you were arguing with but i was just getting started and at the beginning you are so sure you can handle the explosion so sure i have holidays i wouldn t ve been gone almost my whole life if there was some acceptance here if i felt welcome in my own home if well you re not petunia spat in a tone of voice i hadntheard her use since she was 8 fed up stubborn on the brink of a rage black out not welcome petunia it not your house it not even going to be mum house why she selling why the fuck is she selling does she hate memories that much hate being happy petunia had stood up and advanced on me but i stayed sitting in the chair defiantly pursing my lips and tossing the zip up she had thrown at me over onto the couch just missing vernon that woman isntcapable of being happy and you re exactly like her you both think the world out to get you i not like her i said in a lazy deepened tone you wouldntknow if i was happy or not that for certain i ve been gone almost my whole life apparently and when i do come around this is what happens petunia was standing so close to me that her toes could ve been touching my own if i didntcurl them up she swallowed hard and i saw her lip curling with some sort of disgust she had been trying to contain her whole life trying and not succeeding in what the fuck do you want do you want money do you want to ruin the holiday for me i finally got out of going to america with mum and was going to be happy and you come along what the fuck do you want lily i had never heard my sister curse before i wanted a place to feel warm i wanted to come home and get that warm reminiscing feeling that you re supposed to get during holidays i at a friend house we had a fall out of sorts over his mum nonetheless hell it seems i ve got a hard time with mum s petunia rose her thin eyebrows and stared at me you re staying at a boy house you run off to that school full of she cast vernon a glance who was staring at the television with a cup of tea in hand ignoring us to the best of his ability freaks and you get to do whatever the hell you want mum would be so proud lily mmm he is a boy i drawled folding my arms again as petunia bent too close for comfort he turns 18 tomorrow i donteven know you she said in a choked whisper and her eyes spilled over something that was a million lifetimes out of my grasp but had we been 10 and 12 we could ve god things could ve been she wasntgoing to cry petunia didntdo that because you choose not to god petunia just hurry up and start that life you ve been wanting since you were 8 just detach yourself from us as quickly as possible get the hell out of my face i stood up and pushed past her clenching my fists together at my sides you cantinclude yourself in that us you arentpart of the us mum dad and me are the us you ve detached your self you ve brought all of this ignorance to you on yourself you didntlet them love you i went to my room or the room that was my room not long after that statement petunia informed me that vernon and her were only staying the night in order to be there when the land agent came in the morning apparently to show the house or i dontknow that explosion it happened not in the way i expected it to i expected it to end with me throwing the triumphant look to petunia and proving her wrong proving how forgotten and unloved i was and then there d be a rush of blood to the head as i d see the clenched jaw on my sister and i d walk by her with my head held high and wouldntfeel bad until much much later but this explosion wasntone i ve had before it was as if i was struck by something hit forcefully i brought the ignorance to my life outside of my family on myself them not caring them not having much contact was brought on myself those words left her mouth easily so it wasntsomething she just came up with i shut my eyes and it felt like i didntopen them again until i was in the dark bedroom closing the door i was so blind to everything i stared around the dark bedroom and felt slightly dizzy as i threw myself down onto my bed that creaked as i did so jesus i thought throwing my head into my hands when did she become so mature in her own bitchy way with a shaky sigh i let my head find the pillow and folded my arms over my stomach laying flat on my back my head tilted to the side in order to see out of the window i was tired mentally physically i never wanted to see five o clock a m again at quarter to twelve i woke with a start as i heard a distant knocking my eyes flew open as i tried to pinpoint the sound but couldn t i quietly climbed out of bed and tiptoed down the stairs i could hear the television on in petunia room and no lights were on downstairs reaching the bottom of the stairs i saw a running car sitting in the driveway the headlights dimmed i couldnttell what colour it was but it looked fancy i couldnttell whether or not anyone was in it either but that when my sister voice could be heard lily there someone at the door i was in bed watching television with vernon and they just wontgo away i don t i crept into the kitchen where i found petunia pressed nearly flat against a wall passing her i went up on my tiptoes and tried to peer out the window i could just barely make out a figure tall i didntknow go wake vernon i muttered reaching a hand slowly to the curtain and pulling it back some i could see the front step to the left from this window and whoever it was couldntsee me as they were standing staight staring at the stop petunia never mind i rushed to the light switches and turned the kitchen one and outside light on quickly unlocking the door i let him in before he drowned in the once again pouring rain who is it petunia hissed coming back into the kitchen drawing her robe more tightly around herself james i began staring at the boy who was soaked from head to foot and had i been able to see his eyes properly his fringe was matted down because of the rain i would ve known then how angry he was i ignored my sister again as she persisted to know who this tall dark and handsome was i so dontyou dare say sorry he ran a hand back through his hair as droplets of water ran down from his hair and into his eyes i ve called you a bitch once before lily and i have half a mind to do it again this is how these freaks treat you petunia asked shrilly standing near the doorway of the kitchen as she realized the boy stood before me dripping water all over the welcome mat was my age and most likely from my school shut up petunia i said quietly as she began speaking again from behind me i was watching james the whole god damn world doesntrevolve around you lily i swallowed and parted my lips to say something unblinking as i watched this boy i had never seen him like this and there was some shocking comfort i found in it as selfish as it is james potter angry at me was right it was like i had been trying for that since the first day we began things truly angry at me eyes blazing with some kind of light and him seeming even taller as he stood there broad shouldered and hating me i never said it did i eventually said with a dry quiet voice you d think it did the way you act you think you can turn your back on people and not deal with the shit you dish out you left you just up and left and i looked for you all day my mum said you probably just wanted time to yourself but even she was looking anxious when it was 8 o clock and you still hadntshown up did you want that attention lily because i cantfigure out why else you left you could ve talked to me or my mum if it was bothering you that much i canteven look at james maybe you should calm down i interrupted him as politely as that can be done and all i earned was a wild eyed glare from him i scared that you dontget it he muttered softly looking as if his jaw was clenched a bit you thought my mum was hostile towards you before how do you expect her to be now i invited you to spend the holidays i didntplan on acting as babysitter then maybe you shouldn t ve come for fuck sake i turned around intentions to storm up the stairs but petunia was in the doorway of the kitchen standing with her arms folded i think you should leave lily i dontwant to have to call the police move i said murderously pushing past her and grabbing the bags i had in the living room with fucking christmas presents i came back into the kitchen a second later with my bags in hand and looked from james to petunia both of you you especially petunia talk to me like i am five years old and i am so sick of it just fucking stop it i slipped my feet into my shoes and went out the door james following after a second i never want to see him again lily not ever petunia shouted from the step before slamming the door shut and turning the lights off not long after where your coat james asked in a tone of voice that clearly stated he d rather burn himself than talk to me at the momet but it had cooled down a considerable amount and the cold rain was sure to change to snow i dont have one i wore robes they re muddy and buried at the bottom of one of these bags we got into the red car that james father had picked us up in at the train station and it was quite a different situation this time around i had the passenger seat and james was driving for one and there was no light hearted friendly hand holding for two everything about it was dark everything about him was dark everything about the almost midnight sky was dark the rain fell but you couldnteven see the rain drops falling until they hit the windshield you didntknow they were there it was unnerving along with the silence in the car i kept thinking things to myself hearing my own voice it was screaming at me to press my ear against the window and sate my need to hear something other than my own torture hear the rain i couldnthear him breathe it was like he subconciously knew that would make me feel better his breathing his voice and anything that would make me feel anything but a guilty useless bitch he would not supply it was as if that arrogant and stubborn streak i knew he had but rarely seen was very much there showing itself tonight he was showing himself this was a part of james i had to get to know if we were going to be able to i dontknow be friends be something a dull throb began somewhere behind my eyes and intensified until my whole head felt as if it were going to split open from the pain it hurt to move my eyes it hurt to blink i shut my eyes leaning against the cool glass of the window i could open my eyes to narrow slits and just barely seen james and that how i stayed sitting on a bit of an angle watching that brooding james as he sped down the water slicked road james he slammed the brakes on purposely as a set of lights changed to red and he didntlook at me as i spoke his name i need as soon as the light changed to green he sped off and all of this stopping and going and jerking about wasnthelping my head you need what james spat at me rounding a turn i dontknow i murmured near tears stop driving so fast my head hurts god i think it was the silence that gave it to me i need you to say something you need me to say something sweetheart it didntsound sweet though it sounded bitter and cold and it was a slap over the face that not going to fucking happen especially if you d like your head to hurt less fine i leaned back against the window and listened to the hum of the car as the light from streetlamps washed over his face again and again dizzying me slightly seeing his face so set and angry it was unnerving almost scary but in this breathtaking way locked you out did he i vaguely recall hearing her voice as my thoughts were so preoccupied with the car ride home it was a surreal almost out of body experience sitting there on the doorstep feeling as if i could almost see the puddles of water cloud over with frost from the half midnight air i dontthink he meant to was all i replied not making an attempt to stand and go into the house i was trying to remember the soft almost surrender he gave me as we turned down the street there just a lot going on out there right now was his starting sentence completely out of the blue as we had drove for a half hour without any further conversation his hazel green eyes wandered to his window for a moment observing the emptying streets and i dontthink you realize it not many people do i dont want to but there no way around this shit i had not heard him curse as much in the time i had known him then i had tonight and you just disappeared god you want me to be rational lily you kill that part of me and that was the last words he spoke to me i was in some sort of a daze half asleep half holding onto his words but i must ve fell asleep a split second after he spoke to me because the next thing i know i was waking up to a still warm car and an empty driver seat he didntwake me before going in the house somehow i stumbled from the car the abrupt change from the charmed warm car to the steadily dropping december temperature was enough to knock me down and ended up on the doorstep i knocked once felt dizzy and sat down i didntknow what i was waiting for but it wasntfor someone to let me in i didntreally want in melly pulled the door open after about 5 mintues of me sitting there jacketless and all she didntlook surprised to see me and quickly in an amused tone asked if he had locked me out i was just on my way home saw you sitting out here glad he found you the brunette was in the midst of wrapping her scarf around her neck and putting her hands into her pockets i wasntfar was all i murmured clasping my hands together to wane of the cold well goodnight she went down the few stone steps and then looked back up to me sitting there he still up by the way lexi fell asleep before i could put her to bed and i guess he in the process of that now see you lily night and i watched her hurry across the street right up the pathway to her house i sighed and leaned back until i was resting on my elbows staring up at the sky honestly i could have just stayed sitting here i didnt believe that it was raining only a couple of hours ago the clouds had cleared and the night turned bright due to the moon the city lights were a ways off but you could see them giving a faint glow to the sky that faint glow almost overpowered the stars but a few were left brightly twinkling just to provide for this time of year for this night so close to the holy one the stars didntsleep this time of year for everyone else slept less too so there they stayed offering a diamond like twinkle for weary on lookers to take some kind of comfort of it weary on lookers like myself sighing again i stood up and brushed myself off willing the numbness in my fingertips to leave i hadntrealized how cold it was until i had pushed the door half way open and then caught my breath floating up into the air i tilted my head and blew another breath out through my mouth and watched it become a white vapour and float off towards those blinding city lights and far off stars eventually however the tempting warmth of the house overwhelmed me and i stepped in closing the door locking it and leaning against it my ears seemed to buzz for a moment as i adjusted from the sounds of the suburbian night to the warm potter household the quiet sound of their too large television making it way from the living room to the hallway the welcoming light from lamps pouring in from the living room the scent of fresh baked good wafting from just beyond that swinging kitchen door and the deep voice of a brother along with the giggling of his little sister i stepped into the living room to see lexi snuggled down into the couch cushions with a knitted blanket wrapped around her and james sitting on the edge of the couch a hand resting on the back of it as he leaned over her to tickle her with one hand he seemed to be trying to make sleep look appealing to a five year old girl much too excited for the 4 day off christmas lily if i go to sleep will santa claus come a day early lexi sat straight up out of james grip offered a roll of her eyes and looked at me expectantly hate to say it but no i smiled at her as she glared at james dramatically with her arms folded you re such a poopyhead pardon me james raised his eyebrows at the girl and she scrunched her button nose up trying to suppress giggles listen all i try to do is be here for the holidays and be a nice big brother and you re such a little james honestly she five and was just joking urgh i put my fingertips to my forehead as james turned around to look at me obviously not expecting my two cent worth what wrong lily lexi asked sounding genuinely concerned as james scoffed nothing my head just hurts whhyy she persisted tilting her head and watching me closely well you and your brother fight sometimes right she nodded her head of blonde curls bouncing well i have a sister and i went to see her today we fight too and we fought so much today that my head started hurting did she hit you i smiled and shook my head no we just yelled too much sometimes it good to fight you just love each other more o oh are you and james in a fight too i pressed my lips together making a smacking sound as i thought and then shook my head again well yes we are lexi now go to bed james interrupted smoothly oh good then you ll finish your fight and then love each other more ohkay james i ll go to bed now come say goodnight she bounded off the couch dropping the blanket from around her and raced up the stairs my jaw quivered slightly as james looked me over and sighed heavily at me i felt like i had bloody frost hanging from the ends of my hair but i was just being dramatic even so this shirt was nothing sort of warm petunia was right it was a bit too thin here james picked the blanket up that lexi had wrapped around her and draped it over my shoulders as he walked by me come tuck her in with me given the position the two of us were in and the fact he was actually offering me words i couldntdo anything but go with him i was lucky he was offering that james had seemed positively livid earlier james had gone into the bathroom when we got to the top of the stairs and took to shutting the light off and picking a fallen towel up off the floor so i just made my way into lexi bedroom night lexi i said through a yawn causing her to yawn too she grinned at me and turned on her side to face me i sat down onto the floor and leaned on the side of the bed stroking her curls off her forehead i dontknow it just something i remembered from when i was a girl stroking my hair could put me to sleep in an instant probably still could and at the moment i wouldntmuch mind a messy haired boy trying that out no be mad at the messy haired boy lily that messy haired boy looks down on you i found my eyes shut for a moment as lexi did too but she wasntasleep as her voice a lot quieter brought me back lily mmm hmm i murmured brushing my fingertips over her sweetly warm forehead do you love my brother i laughed softly and shut my eyes again i couldntdo this now i couldntthink of caring about him at all because he was so i dontknow do you want me to i murmured at her through another chuckle i pulled my eyes open to see her nod and my laughing stopped he my best friend lexi i sure i could friends love friends and your brother can be a good friend you wanna know a secret the little girl yawned again and pulled the comforters up to her chin sure i thinnkk he loves yoou i smiled at her and kissed my palm then pressing it against her cheek you re sweet darling i watched her drift off and wondered what had been taking james so long it was just a light switch and a towel he my eyes widened as i listened for a moment and i swore that i could hear him breathe unlike earlier i looked over my shoulder and there he was leaning against the frame of the doorway with his arms folded over his chest and a pensive look on his face imaginative kid isntshe james said quietly before crossing the room donning a kiss onto her forehead and then standing above me with his arms folded again i dontthink you have to be imaginative to come up with that do you think maybe some other people in this house are getting imaginative when it comes to us i spoke to him as we left the room him shutting the door halfway i shifted the blanket around my shoulders as we made our way back down the stairs and into the kitchen which was less bright and intimidating this time of night than it had been earlier that day it was dark save for the small amount of light coming from a light above the kitchen sink james had a mug sitting on the counter already and he boiled the water in the kettle in an instant with a tap of his wand want some he asked gesturing to the mug that had hot chocolate powder in it yes please i said with a smile what girl could resist hot chocolate at almost 1 in the morning with a boy whom she swore she was going to hate not i that for sure he handed me my mug of cocoa and he held onto it a moment longer when i went to take it from him i pursed my lips one hand clasping the ends of the blanket together so that it wouldntfall from my shoulders and the other pressed against the side of the mug revelling in it warmth i tilted my head and raised my eyebrows at him waiting for him to say or do something rather than stare at me with that hazel unblinking gaze i dontlove you lily his voice a rugged murmur and his full of some swirling mist that i wasntabout to try to see through i dontlove you lily the simplest thing in the world and my house was for sale god right about now you could put a price tag on my sick sick heart and sell it too it was no use to me ohkay but answer my question are your parents getting the wrong impression james let go of the mug and brushed by me heading to the living room and i quickly followed i told my mum a hundred times over that you i were just friends ohkay in the letters to come after she said i should invite you i reminded her everytime that we were just friends i dontknow what it has to do with any if your mum thinks that you and me are more than friends then she is going to be hostile towards me because she doesntwant me moving in on melly territory this is about melly james asked his voice dangerously quiet stopping short in his progress to the living room and turning to face me you took off today because of melly no this isntabout melly this about you and me james i made a sound of frustration as i walked by him into the living room that was glowing orange from an absolutely gorgeous hearth with a crackling fire and i dontlove you either i settled down onto the couch shivering for whatever reason and glad for the blanket warmth at the moment there were a hundred moments in which i truly appreciated james half as many moments when i would like to slap him and one single moment when i looked at him and saw so much more than i meant to a boy that was really a man and friend that was more than a friend and just so many emotions lay within a simple expression from him that it could confuse any girl he sat down next to me when i rose the mug of cocoa to my lips and took a long sip realizing just how very much i loved hot chocolate how it just seemed to course through your veins finding the coldest place within you staring from there and then warming you up instantly this is good i said quietly watching the flames dance it was such an odd contrast this room this large muggle television casting a blue glare over our faces and then the old fireplace flames leaping and painting a picture of years gone past it is james agreed slowly taking a seat next to me and plopping his feet up on the coffee table and that how we stayed for at least five minutes until i had this overwhelming urge to ruin it well just break it not let things remain like they were because he had been so cold earlier and i i set my mug onto the coffee table and turned to face james who was to the right of me i crossed my legs and pressed my fingertips together and before long i could feel his gaze on me you want to talk about it dontyou i offered a nod as he asked this and didntlook up from my hands i was worried he muttered and it sounded muffled in an echoing sort of way as he took a sip from his mug i dontknow i donthave much of an excuse for the number of times i said fuck and i donthave much of an excuse for talking to you like you re five all i can say is i sorry but do you mean it do you mean you re sorry or do you not regret it because you feel it was necessary for that to happen to the two of us a fight james massaged his temple with one of his hands and sighed i haventyelled that much in years and dammit it felt good to let you know how i was really feeling i guess but i was a bit out of place you just scared the hell out of me disappearing like you did there so much james trailed off as i cleared my throat and tilted my head to the side taking a good long look at him i promise you i stronger than you think i am i whispered my nose stinging with a rush of emotion as i tried not to blink i not five i dontwant this friendship if it going to be your babysitting me james sighed leaning his head back against the back of the couch sometimes when i look at you it like i have been looking at you for my whole life and i dontwant you to not want this friendship i swear it lily like i said earlier i a completely irrational person when i around you i sighed i just wanted your mum to like me and she she didn t and you said she would and i dontknow why i went there why did you you constantly are saying how awful your sister been to you how your mum is so it was fate i think or something like that if i hadn t left diagon alley if i your mum had liked me i wouldn t ve ended up at home and i wouldn t ve seen the for sale sign on the lawn i wouldn t ve realized just how very gone i am to them i wouldn t ve seen that side of you i saw him swallow hard his adam apple protruding i wasntthe nicest was i i dunno i just lost it stop trying to justify it just leave it it a part of you and you were worried and if that how you get when you re worried then i flattered you were so different i trailed off quietly and he nodded draining his mug and setting it on the coffee table all right i off to bed goodnight i nodded and turned to the television i love this show was all i said as he rounded the corner and i saw him start up the stairs it wasnta minute and he back into the living room with a hand at the nape of his neck rubbing it in a nervous habit sort of way that was rude i wontgo to bed s long as you re going to be up i had laid down on the couch and spread my feet out on it so that when he went to sit back down he had to lift my feet sit down and then position my feet in his lap warm enough he asked needlessly tracing his fingertips over my socked feet i giggled slightly and nodded my head yes thanks mmm hmm james muttered and his fingertips were at the bottom of my pajama pants before wandering up underneath expecting this to be ticklish i stiffened but it was the complete opposite it was soothing he kind of massaged the skin and i sent him a warm smile when he looked up at me you ve got lovely legs you know i laughed as he grinned cheekily and took his hand out from my pantleg thanks for that i said sarcastically smiling and sat up leaning over close to him hey james i whispered after a minute yeah lil he was watching the television and i grinned further seeing the clock that read close to 1 in the morning happy birthday there was something about how quickly he changed that threw me off made me confused and made my head spin he was mean earlier but i guess in a necessary way there was something admirable about the way he spoke to me cursing his head off just something about him then that oozed superiority and a broad span of chest and shoulders and then he d come back down to meet earth and apologize for his words it was a comfort to know that not all people were stubborn and hostile when it came to that one word sorry he was no less of a mystery as the days progressed and i found myself wrapped deeper in who he was no less of a mystery in any way perhaps in one way and one way only how he saw me you know he cared about me that was there staring me directly in the face hazel meeting my green it was there but i was so blind to it and his birthday was now or tomorrow or in a few hours and i was determined to set the rest of this holiday right i was determined to push tonight out of my mind because it hurt in an unthawing sort of way bringing me out into the light showing me things i ve been trying to pretend didntexsist for years lily you are the only person i know who is intelligent enough to admit her flaws and faults but stupid enough to push them away and ignore the fact she has any james potter had a way abc chapter 13 who we are reminder of the pictures described in chapter nine the two of us were sitting on one of the logs and james had his arm around my shoulder i had one of my hands splayed against his chest and looked as if i had been laughing when the picture was taken he was looking straight at the camera and it may have been the most flattering picture i had ever seen of him it was dark behind us but the flash from the camera and the glow from the fire illuminated his face shadows were cast down at angles over his cheeks and it was just that that little bit of mystery protruding the last one was was of james i dance twirling or whatever he had done that night i sucked in a sharp breath and was astonished at how nice i looked not physically or anything my hair didntlook incredible that night and my eyelashes werentcurled to perfection or anything i just looked nice and happy whilst being twirled by him safe there was something about the night that was slowly putting me to sleep but keeping me awake because it felt so nice the whole thing with my house being for sale was nothing i wanted to deal with and sure burying it deep away until i forced to confront it probably isntthe best way to handle things but the potter household was warm and james could utter and apologie without having his ego bruised his pride bursted his head deflated his stubborn streak stopped he could apologize and things quickly were thrust back to being normal and i didnthave another second that night to think of how the day had made my head spin and james and i had our first actual fight and it was over like that i didntthink about it while i was sitting there with his hands up my pant leg and his voice as soothingly deep as it was he simply smiled when i wished him a happy birthday it was technically the 21st of december and he was technically 18 years old when midnight struck he simply smiled stood up and we found ourselves in the kitchen satisfying some late night early morning craving of cookies and milk at some point before two a m we parted ways and he bade me a whispery goodnight in the middle of the hallway before i turned to go to my temporary bedroom and he to his own my eyelids were begging to be closed just as my lips decided they were dying to be kissed again sirius i couldntthink of him i couldntask myself what i wanted with him whether i liked him or not or it was pure physical attraction not even physical attraction just a boy to kiss at appropriate times as if to teach me some sort of lesson eventually sirius black a lesson in life a lesson of not quite love a lesson of lips and how those lips should be kissed as properly as possible and with those lips in mind i fell asleep the most unbelievable feeling i had experienced thus far during christmas break was feeling free free and sexy i woke up at 8 a m that morning and took a long warm shower changing into a silky strappy hit me at the knees nightgown as it was the quickest thing to grab i didntthink anybody else was up this early and that one reason i didntturn over and go back to sleep when i saw the clock i wanted to be the only one up awake aware there i wanted the potter to disappear so i could work out the mess of things going on inside my head before i left the bedroom i grabbed my robe and wrapped it around me creeping over to james bedroom and listening outside of the door i could hear him softly snoring i continued on my way over to the stairs finding myself on the potter floor lexi bedroom door was open as was mr mrs potter s i took a deep breath and finished going down the stairs to the entrance hall there was nobody in the den or living room and the only option left was the kitchen and it was empty gloriously quiet and empty james we re gone to your uncle mac for the day brunch dropping our presents off etc we didntfigure you d want to go what with lily being here and the pain in the ass your mother been over her lately so here your time alone son use it wisely dad i raised my eyebrows as i read his father note and couldnthelp but smirk slightly in some sort of twisted satisfaction mr potter liked me and i had that to be proud of and this house was completely empty except for a sleeping james and me it was winter solstice and it was already a bright morning frost covered the window panes as the sun was far too weak this early to melt through it but it gave the whole world a slightly hazy look as i peered through the kitchen windows this was what winter was meant to be this was the winter we forgot about when we were yearning for july this early morning december 21st was the winter i remembered from years gone by and no events of the day before were going to keep me from giving james a happy birthday he wanted breakfast i remember him telling me that when he first invited me to his house for christmas breakfast he said simply when i asked him what to get him for his birthday could i cook he asked yes i said breakfast and he smiled so that what i was making at 8 30 i was making breakfast without magic because i found it much easier bacon scrambled eggs pancakes and coffee the kitchen smelled incredible and soon the frost on the windows was clouded by the steam from my cooking and boiling kettle and this was what i imagined the potter household to be from the start warm smelling like breakfast and inviting his loud steady breathing was proof enough that he was still sleeping as i pushed his bedroom door open with my shoulder and went into the room i set the tray down on the floor and went over to the window pulling the curtains back and the blind up the pale light poured in and illuminated the dark room tying my robe tighter around my waist i went over to pick the tray up again but ended up catching a glance of his sleeping face he had one of those faces that would hold the exact same characteristics when he 40 that he has now if he wrinkled it would just mature him further if his forehead developed creases that were permanent it would just give him that constant look of worry that would probably suit him you knew his eyes would never lose what was so very theirs those lustrous hazel green eyes that needed to be partially hidden by his glasses because if they were not they would completely overwhelm you he looked innocent and naive with his eyes shut and his lips slightly parted as he breathed through his mouth he looked almost like an 8 year old version of himself he was to remain sleeping until i woke him because i had not known the 8 year old james and i thought it was fair for me to get a glimpse of him even if he was so very far away but right now at 8 30 in the morning it looked like he d wake up with his voice an octave or two higher height somewhere in the 4 feet range and those wide startling eyes would posess that natural charm of his that wore off a bit as the years progressed i felt like i had missed out on half of my own life not having known james for all of his i felt incomplete and almost empty like i thought i knew him but something would abruptly change and i d lose his friendship all because i didntknow him when he was a boy i decided that that we were spending an excessive amount of time together and i may go insane if i tried to get through a day without wanting to talk to him or ask him questions it was strange this was me realizing what a friendship was about it was me realizing lots of friends were rarely apart and i was slowly forming that connection to james happy birthday i exclaimed as i saw him begin to stir squinting against the sunlight pouring in his usually covered window mrmph he murmured flopping over onto his stomach reaching for his glasses and thrusting them on it is my birthday the whole day 8 30 wasntnecessary breakfast remember you wanted breakfast for a present he offered me a tired grin and rubbed at his eyes before actually seeing me and the tray of food you re insane james said through a yawn and a rumple of his hair and true i did ask for breakfast but you look like you re going to put on a bit of a performance for me too got anything on under the robe lil the cheeky grin that was on his face was enough to amuse me and i just shook my head trying to look incredulous but failing to do so as i smiled at him wouldntyou like to know he appreciated the breakfast way too much the way his eyes seemed to light up as i situated the tray in front of him while he leaned against the headboard you re too good to me love james grinned before picking up his fork and digging into the scrambled eggs which no he didntwant any ketchup salt or pepper on just butter and his pancakes no butter just syrup way too much maple syrup and he dipped his bacon in the left over maple syrup and his coffee no cream but three spoonfuls of sugar i sat at the opposite end of the bed with my feet stretched out near the pillows watching him eat and not even offer conversation your parents went to visit your uncle mac according to a note found on the kitchen table oh yeah for brunch aunt mary cantcook nearly as good as you though their daughter my cousin jenn is pregnant she 25 ish they ll probably be over later today i have something else to give you i said quickly standing and leaving the bedroom running over to the one i was staying in i pulled open the drawer on the nightstand and pulled out two photographs that bridget had given me i didntknow whether to give them to him i didntknow whether he had pushed the memories of that bonfire night away and completely forgot about how close we grew that night but against all better judgement i grabbed the pictures up and quickly walked back to his bedroom pick a hand i said to him something my father had done to me when i was younger holding each of them behind my back as i stood at the edge of the bed you re scaring me he said after setting his coffee down and cocking an eyebrow at me uhm the right one he reached over and tapped my wrist and i handed the picture of choice to him ah wow he grinned and inspected the picture closely i bit my lip watching him classic boy looking at camera girl admiring boy and why not i just so damn admirable i look good donti no but honestly thank you you look incredible by the way when he looked up at me i smiled a small awkward smile and kept my other hand behind my back can i see that one he asked of course when he noticed i didntoffer to show my hand as it held the picture he had twirled me in mmm no james grinned and leaned over the bed until he could reach my arm he squeezed my wrist until it hurt slightly and i threw the photo at him prat i muttered rubbing my red wrist as he shrugged and picked the picture up the grin he wore faded and was replaced with some sort of thoughtful look like he had forgotten about it for a moment but then it came flooding back and he was wondering how he ever forgot the way he was that night something was different about him that night and he was realizing that it seemed oh was all i heard him say after a moment of peering to intently at the picture this you should keep this one yeah you were happy that night he handed the picture back to me and i tucked it into the pocket of the robe you didntlike that one i asked smiling slightly my eyes narrowed lightly as i studied him no no i did i did and that was all he offered me before draining his mug of coffee and eventually the conversation took a turn to something else and he had liked the picture he liked it when it was taken he liked that night and he had to have liked the picture i saw it when his grin faded and he looked at it thoughtfully you dontlook at a picture thoughtfully if you dontlike it you dontlook at it for as long as he did if you dontlike it i wasntput out about it or anything because it was a comfort to know he became as disoriented as me when he saw that dance twirling picture it was something after 9 and i was settled back at the opposite end of the bed arms folded and watching james enjoy reading the paper i ve got to shower i think he stretched yawned twisted turned scrunched his nose up and finally grinned at me i ll be quick stay here or whatever you look tired he went through the door in his bedroom into the connecting bedroom and i leaned my head back closing my eyes i felt guilty this morning for enjoying the fact the potter were out enjoying the fact i wasntat home enjoying the fact i d never have to go back to that place i figured it was some all time low for a girl like me not caring one way or another whether she spent any holidays with her family ever again was i the only one in the world who was horribly selfishly ragged edged i heard the water in the bathroom turn on after only a minute and i made myself comfortable properly on the bed resting my head on the pillows apparently to occupy my mind when i bored i become nosey or that my excuse for this to this day i say i just get nosey when things get awkward or boring or anything like that that why when i noticed an edge of parchment sticking out from the drawer of james nightstand i pulled it open flattened the parchment and closed it again but then i realized it was a rather long piece of parchment and was wrenching the drawer open again my eyes scrolled down to the bottom not bothering to read any in between stuff where the person signed the obvious letter all the best james jo jo as in jocelyn with strawberry blonde hair and side swept bangs his november til june 6th year but she was in 7th girlfriend the one he thought he loved but actually didn t the one who he didntlove but might as well had because she was important to him and deflated his head a bit and made him part of who he was a letter from jo i couldnthelp but let my eyes wander back up the parchment certain words popping out at me dontdo it lily that invading priva i didntfinish the thought dear james it hard to think it only been a year since that disasterous birthday of yours you said that would be the first and last time you ever invited a girl over to meet your mum friend girlfriend anything do you remember that my god she tried to give me that incredible white dress and i didntknow what to do she d scoff at me if i wouldntaccept it but then call me selfish or something if i did so have things improved on the girl front since then happy almost 18th by the way it a shame you werentturning 18 this time last year you and i may have worked out then sirius was always frightfully against us anyway darling i dontknow why i mentioned that white dress a year later perhaps because i sitting here in my bedroom seeing my own white dress at this very moment yeah i engaged to be married stupid of me isntit oh but i love him as strange as it is for me to admit it a year ago i was just trying to be in love with you and here i am actually in love and getting married on january 1st the dress just arrived today and quite odd timing seeming i decided to write to you today have you been in love yet james it wonderful once you get there it just the getting there thing that the hardest i suppose trying to get there is wonderful itself but trying to get there blinds you and you dontrealize it until you ve gotten there his name is josh he comes from a good pureblood wizarding family you wontbelieve how much those things matter now a days i would ve invited you to the wedding had i thought you d show up because honestly darling you wouldn t would you you re much too smart to go digging up the past i just wanted to wish you happy holidays you left me reeling you know that i refuse to believe you were born anything but a strong broad shouldered man because even at 16 you were that at 17 you were that and at 18 i sure you will be that and a whole lot more once you find the right girl god james just find the right girl because if you do she will deserve you she will be nothing but the best and she ll have pretty eyes that you get lost in because getting lost is something you ve always counted on all the best james jo pretty eyes and nothing but the best that blue eyed year older than him jocelyn he talked of was getting married she had fallen in love sometime after june with someone other than james she was getting married just like that she was good with words eloquent you could tell that at the beginning of the letter the way her words were scrawled out and loopy mrs potter hadntliked her either it seemed he said he d never bring another girl home and here i was sirius was against them james was nothing but a strong broad shouldered man to her when all i could see was a boy who was trying damn hard to keep his shoulders broad why couldnti look at james and see more than that boyish visage of him i felt as if i was being unfair to him being a best friend but not seeing him as man or anything more than that best friend he was good looking but was considered nothing sexual to me and then the bathroom door opened there was a flurry of steam and i could almost feel it meet my face james potter stood with a towel at his waist and blinking water droplets from his eyes his glasses were fogged for a moment but they unfogged quickly and he saw me sitting on his bed with jocelyn letter still in my hand and i would ve been gaping had my mind took the time to register and actually see the towel clad james but i snapped into panic mode and flew my hand around to the drawer going to shove it back in what do you have he asked curiously but in a way that told me he already knew um i was just i saw it sticking from the drawer and went to shove it back in and read it jocelyn letter right you read it no james i lily he exclaimed interrupting me and raising his eyebrows high just tell me did you read it i pursed my lips thinking for a moment and shuddered a response yes while i was reading it i never thought that i shouldnthave i never thought to stop reading it and put it back and respect his privacy i read it i was that curious about his past about that part i didntknow about jocelyn the girl who had him but let him get away i was that painfully curious that i forgot who james was for an instant i forgot who we were and how we were he had let me in i had made my way into james life and i knew it was a fragile ground to be upon i knew i could fuck things up simply by trying to dig too deep and invade too much but i had read that letter from that girl who had meant so much to him and i had gone somewhere that was so completely james s and i was petrified in that moment i had ruined things just like that if james had wanted to talk to me more about jocelyn or tell me she wrote he would ve but i didntgive it a chance for that to happen i felt completely exposed and he was the one standing there in the towel with water droplets sliding down his neck shoulders chest and down to somewhere my mind had not yet wandered to a fit boy in a towel and i couldntlook at any detail i couldntsee him satisfied now pried far enough have you i forgot clothes he pulled a drawer open on his dresser with one hand and with the other he held the towel together he yanked a couple of things out glared at me over his shoulder and slammed the door to the bathroom i was too startled over being caught or whatever that i hadntbeen able to form any sort of apologie and my mind spun as i left his bedroom carrying the breakfast tray and as tense potentially horrible as things had become in a split second i couldntstop repeating lines from jocelyn letter in my head and i liked to think i had pretty eyes that a boy could get lost in that afternoon after i had taken to cleaning up my mess in the kitchen the whole morning and then falling back to sleep when i surrendered to my room i sat at the vanity in the room that was mine for the holidays and stared at my reflection with my hair tied up into a loose ponytail my neck felt cold i realized as i dug through my makeup bag in search of my mascara i couldntrecall the last time i wore my hair in a ponytail and i kept putting both of my hands on my neck touching the revealed skin i hadntspoken to james since that morning and i was wondering if i ever could speak to him again i was lucky that we had gotten back onto speaking terms the night before even though there was still something not quite right with him and then i go do something as simple as read a letter not thinking the result would be this not thinking the aftermath would be something as dramatic as this sighing i brushed the mascara onto my eyelashes trying to prevent it from clumping as i did so i didntlike to wear a lot of makeup but mascara was almost a necessity it just made a girls eyes look wider but in a delicate way it offered a sense of divulgence letting people see your eyes at their absolute best at their brightest and nicest and your eyes could be the beginning of something i was staring at the length of my lashes when a knock came to the closed door and brought me from my reverie of thoughts still being in my nightgown and robe i tied it together and went to the door taking a deep breath preparing to face james potter but it was remus he wore a pair of dark jeans and an navy blue half zip sweater hi i said breathily almost overjoyed to see the hostile marauder who had not yet decided whether or not he liked me he was a comfort compared to who i had been expecting what are you doing here james birthday we re required to be here we that means sirius wasntfar off can i come in i looked into the bedroom and shrugged i guess so sure good remus stepped by me looking around the bedroom you look nice by the way i raised my eyebrows and shut the bedroom door behind me you didnteven look at me remus he turned around from where he was in the middle of the bedroom and looked me up and down realizing i was in a nightgown beneath the robe he grinned you look even better then remus went over and sprawled out on my bed putting his hands behind his head and sighed contentedly compared to the last one on one encounter that i had with the marauder he looked happy tufts of his hair were sticking up and the blue of his eyes was almost startling to me after a day and a half of seeing nothing but james intense hazel the colour of his skin wasntas golden or divine in the dark of my bedroom but at least there werentany bags beneath his eyes or wrinkles tugging at his skin he looked like he had gotten a full night sleep and done nothing but lounge about for a whole day so james what wrong with him he was in the kitchen slamming things about when we got here oh i said sitting down on the edge of the bed folding my arms across my chest that why you re here is it to find out what i screwed up this time yeah remus moved his eyes from the ceiling and met my own and his gaze was as cold as my words had been and when he shrugged his not so broad shoulders i narrowed my eyes at him pretty much yes i hated how he could be so casual when situations were as nerve wracking as this i hated how he could shrug and be a cold hearted bastard but look so good fuck you remus no thank you lily i can think of two other who might be willing though he rolled his eyes and sighed heavily sitting up next to me you re such a bastard i murmured straightening my back and squaring my shoulders glaring down at the floor just because you dontlike me you dontlike that james and me are friends and you dontlike that sirius likes me doesntmean you have to be so god damn immature if there the slightest the slightest what please continue because i d sure as hell like to know what went on this time remus interrupted folding his arms like my own were folded and setting his jaw i read a happy birthday letter from jocelyn without his permission now get out i ground out my teeth clenched together and my hands at my sides as i stood in unison with remus my robe had come untied at some point during his short visit and when i stood it gave a good view of the not much room for imagination nightgown i wore remus glanced this on the way out and raised his eyebrows in some sort of cynical approvement i flung the door open and pushed him hard on the back through it just as sirius came into view at the end of the hall having just ascended the stairs both remus and i fell short in our steps and i quickly snatched my hand off of his back sirius kept coming towards us shoving his hands into his pockets and observing the situation with a creased forehead remus leaving the bedroom with me in a nightgown my robe untied and my loose ponytail probably giving off the idea that it had become loose for a reason am i interrupting something sirius asked all blas and handsome i said nothing as remus smirked at sirius and then looked to me putting a hand on my forehead and brushing stray hairs away i shook my head mouthed wordlessly and went back into the bedroom slamming the door shut and leaning against it breathing hard this was not christmas this was not how it was supposed to be this was not working this wasntright i shouldn t ve started a damn thing with any of them it had to be at least three minutes until there was a soft sound against the door and my eyes fluttered open i held my breath and listened again thinking it was a knock but the sound never came again curious i went to pull the door open and when i did i found sirius had been pressed against it he didntfall flat on his back when i opened the door it was much like he was expecting it and held himself up i was just joking when i asked if i was interrupting hell i wouldntthink you d somehow get involved with all sirius honestly you dontknow how tired i am of confrontations i muttered throwing a hand to my forehead and then offering the same one to him he got to his feet tugging my hand slightly and then straightened his tshirt talking feeling the marauders i tired of all that sirius grinned rather sheepishly at me and shoved his hands into his pockets i sorry he said and i leaned against the edge of the half open door looking at him wearily james putting you through hell and i had to laugh at how completely opposite him and remus were remus accused me of messing something up and sirius put the blame on his best friend come in here i grabbed onto his wrist and tugged him inside the room shutting the door once again and there he was the sirius who i became so unbelievably overwhelmed by the one who i saw in dark corners of a hallway and the one whose kisses were my first the one who was so dark and had grey blue eyes and thick brown hair he wasnttall enough but he was for me he was too charming but pulled it off and i wondered if he was capable of being anything but alive you know sad depressed upset i wondered if he was ever any of those things because if he was i d want to see it i d want to see his eyes anything but brilliant and i d want to see his hair anything but perfect and i d want to hear his voice anything but cool and deep he was rugged and completely sure of himself but honestly there was so much more to him that i hadnthad a chance to realize his eyes looking like they were right now and his face completely clean shaven it was when i forgot how things were supposed to happen and i forgot that what sirius and i were doing was so irresponsible and risky and i just wanted to kiss him and find the boy who could take all of my thoughts away whether or not that was good sirius stepped closer to me and the room was only lit by a dim lamp so there were some shadows playing around his feaures and making his expression hard to decipher it could ve been passionate and wanton or it could ve been dark and infuriated two very different expressions but it didntmuch matter because with sirius black they both led to the same thing and that when i found the robe slipping from my shoulders as i was desperately yet gently pushed against the door by him why the hell are you wearing this he murmured rhetorically referring to the nightgown i was wearing as his hands ran over the silky material of it up and down my sides if i had felt exposed earlier wearing the gown under a robe i certainly felt exposed now with sirius pressed against me and me pressed against a door such a classic move i felt like i had walked onto the set of some sex filled romantic movie and i didntmuch enjoy the thought of that he kissed me after a few moments of just seeming to be mezmerized by my skin it was indescribable being touched like that his hands were on the small of my back and then running down my arms and then skimming the hem of the nightgown running over my legs and then massaging the back of my neck to calm me before he kissed me because my breathing was so damn rapid that he probably thought i was going to have a heart attack before he could his kiss was soft and left me burning but he pulled back before i could do anything to satisfy that one of his legs was pressed somewhere between my own and his other leg was on the other side of my left leg he had me pinned quite well and when he pulled away there was something besides the heavy feeling of our sudden desire hanging in the air sirius mouth was nearly touching my ear and i swore if he kissed it i would die but that thought of melting at ear kisses was quickly gone as he spoke in a harsh whisper instead of doing any kissing i hope to god you donttrust remus with anything because he was kind enough to inform me of all the hiding that been going on the past few weeks a memory of me laying in james bed and then an invisibility cloak being thrown over me to keep me hidden from sirius popped into my mind a memory of wanting to keep james me strictly between james and me because he was so incredibly mine at times and not let sirius know that it not like it that big of a deal you being in james bed that night the big deal is you all three of you chose to hide it from me like i was some kind of sadistic maniac who was liable to murder somebody if i saw you in his bed i dontknow why you have to hide anything james related from me i dontknow why you think that going to get us anywhere being a twisted little bit his lips brushed against my ear and i gasped at the contrast of his warm lips and of the blistering cold words he was breathing at me i swore something hit me hard as the realization hit me when the hiding was being done i didntthink it was a big deal i swore i didntcare if sirius found anything out they werentsecrets words shared between remus and me werentsecrets or james and me i didntcare then but i cared now remus had warned me had told me of how cool and casual sirius was when he was angry and here he was whispering in my ear so shrewdly after making me think i had drove him into some uncontrollable state of want he had made me think he wanted me that he wanted to kiss me and make me feel things that nobody had before he had been so pressed against me and so close all with startlingly hellish intentions sirius didntfinish his words because i had gasped and then pushed him away from me staring at him with my chest heaving slightly as i struggled to breathe normally and not let him know just how breathless he had left me before turning it all upside down he himself was taking heavier breaths than usual and i swore his eyes had darkened to almost black or at least from where he was standing they looked almost black the shadows crept down his face from his fringe casting a shade over his eyes and i swear they were almost black penetratingly cold leave was all i could choke out my eyes unbelievably wide and he knew it he offered me no words as he brushed by me he didntoffer my still rising chest a glance sirius black just left like i told him to knowing his words struck me hard i was in in disbelief i couldn t the amount of times i said it i dontthink i could count on both of my hands the number of times i pleaded with him and received nothing but a pity smile i could not tell you the sum of all times that i had been as pathetic as i am capable of being with my lips as pouted as they are capable of being i couldntclarify unless i sat down and thought about it for a few days i was always asking him to get away escape was my word for it let escape tonight you know we could get out of here find our place because we must have one let just leave it all behind please please james wasntone for it though practically from the beginning of anything him i related i had wanted to leave with him it didntmatter what we were as long as we were that together as long as i could let everything go and be as free as i was never allowed to be he kept me grounded and i d hate him for it at the time and a minute later realize how unbelievably crazy i had been to think we could do whatever it had been that i wanted to that time let go james let just leave them why dontyou ever want to sometimes i kept my distance from everyone until about seven o clock i didntknow where the day had gone and it left me feeling empty james aunt uncle and cousin were there mac mary and jenn jenn husband was with his family and would join her for the holidays on the 24th and jenn was very pregnant i think mr potter had said that on first observation of his niece by marriage for the first time in a few months 8 months pregnant to be exact uncle jude she had replied with a cheeky smile apparently dinner was unofficial that night as there was a tray of sandwiches in the living room with the socialites and a pan with half of a pizza on top the stove in the kitchen when i came downstairs after cowering in my room since the visits from two marauders i went straight for the kitchen passing the living room undetected since i had only had toast the whole day i had a piece of cold pizza and a glass of milk anything to keep me in that kitchen but then there was remus and his apparent thirst for water and so my leaning against the edge of the counter with folded arms was interrupted by the sandy haired arsehole lily he greeted with a nod as he entered the kitchen and took a glass from the cupboard do you just want everybody to be as unhappy as you you must telling sirius there was stuff being hidden was unbelievably unnecessary i not unhappy lily remus said easily leaning against the counter like i was and taking a few gulps of the water before dumping the rest down the sink it funny how the two of us work i like to think you re the one who wants to make everyone as unhappy as yourself i sighed and pushed my hair from my face feeling like if i couldntcome out of this test with remus alive then i wouldntmake it through anything because remus was not going to matter to me there was no reason for him to if i could just prove myself to him or lower his level of confidence i dontknow then maybe i d be able to get through something with the other two you hid me from him you threw the bloody invisibility cloak over me and pushed me out of the room i didntask you to i not entirely sure why you did it why you had to tell him that i don t that i dontgo into detail about james when i with him why should i you ve confused the hell out of me first you re watching out for me second you re telling me not to hurt sirius because he wontbe hurt and then you re hugging me and now is this all because you donttrust me and dontwant them to trust me if you have a good reason to go around saying a load of shit and sabotaging any chance i d have with sirius then by all fucking means i d like to hear it remus i had pushed myself off from the counter and stood directly in front of him so that he couldntmove from the counter without pushing me out of the way the sandy haired marauder gripped my upper arms and stared down at me with all the intensity either of us could handle it hurt so bad not to blink as i challenged him that who he was he was a challenge the challenge he was impossible and ever changing and made my mind spin when i d see him from far away all golden and god like and then he d be so close to me and i d want to slap him wipe the smirk off of his all knowing face so you want something with sirius then you really honestly do i pressed my lips together as he asked his quietly not releasing my arms i did i thought i did i at least wanted to get to know him but now that he thinks it wont matter what he thinks or what i told him none of that matters if sirius knows that you want something with him that james isntthe number one priority in your life that you re not going to blow sirius off for james it wontmatter he doesntknow that he doesntknow you want something with him he doesntknow that you re not in love with james or something you just told sirius i was hiding stuff because you thought i was just fucking around with him and didn t want anything i tilted my head and maybe just maybe if i peered far enough into those stormy blues i swear it to god to look at you when you re around james remus trailed off as i had trailed my thoughts off and i nodded what to look at me when i around james what remus swallowed and nodded his head once you just haventoffered sirius a smile like that yet you haventlooked that happy i finished for him in a choked voice and he nodded again yeah happy and i dontknow but maybe you haventhad enough time to be happy with sirius maybe you ve not gotten there yet and i understand that but god james and you are so tears welled in my eyes briefly and i blinked excessively soothing the stinging of them james and i are so what so not talking i laughed and probably in a bitter resentful way so different so wrong jesus remus if you ever get the urge to spill to sirius again let him know that let him know that james and i are absolutely nothing and he sirius just has to let me be something to him and i will i swear i will i sighed and remus hands let go of my arms his own falling to his sides happy holidays mmm i turned to go as remus shoved his hands into his pockets and arched his shoulders staring down at the floor james ll get over it sirius probably already has and i guess i could talk to him or something dontsay you and james are nothing because that nothing is the only best friend you got remus left the kitchen first which almost left me staggering and on the way out he squeezed my shoulder reassuringly i had broke him and it felt rather good but in a mind boggling way i just couldntunderstand that boy or why he was so unsure of me we didntneed anything ohmygodintense we just needed to know that the two of us would have to learn to trust like care for one another if we were going to be sharing friends we could be friends ourselves if he d just stop blocking the world out it who he is the world much easier to handle when it on the other side of a line when you re there with your friends and the world there facing you down i guess i probably turned that world upside down and he had nothing too stable his friends were crossing that line over to where the world was and once you cross that line let people in everything could be destroyed i was learning that lesson myself 8 o clock somehow rolled around and i stared at the clock for a good minute to make sure my mind recgonized that 8 o clock the day had come and was going and it was 8 o clock the hour when everything died down or started up on weekdays it when you were settling in finishing your work getting comfortable feeling relaxed on weekends it when you were dolling yourself up hanging out with friends or just beginning your evening of doing nothing i was in love with that hour with how it looked felt and on certain evenings even smelled the moon and stars were just getting acquainted and comfortable with one another and any fragment of sunset was gone leaving a navy sky with glittering silver or just a black canvas on particularly dark nights any internal battles you were having with yourself throughout the day were likely to have had come to an end and you could feel at peace for just that one hour i felt beautiful at 8 o clock and on december 21st 8 o clock smelled like ginger and the faint trace of a crackling fire it smelled like home and i was startled to find myself nearly believing that my home had actually been like that actually smelled that warm and enticing but no not my home just any home it how home is meant to smell there was a point i guess before 8 o clock that sirius remus left for the lupin residence declaring an early morning tomororw i was standing out in the hallway near the wall listening to them in the living room biting my thumb nail and so badly wanting to find myself part of that someday you boys can floo from the fireplace in my study i heard mr potter say and sirius as if a grin were upon his face say yes sir they said their goodnight s wished a final happy birthday to james and i assumed they left the living room and went through into the study that was just off the living room i held my breath for a moment as there was nothing but absolute quiet in the living room and when somebody started talking again i slowly released the breath finding myself pressed nearly flat against the wall there was no way in hell i could stay out of the way much longer there was no way in hell mrs potter was going to like me more if i kept away from her family and was a distant little bitch but there was also no way in hell that i could go in there and face james without some sort of break down stepping as gracefully and tentatively as a girl as broken and emotional as me could into the living room i looked around the dimly lit living room warmly lit a tall single lamp and the dancing glow of the fire jenn was laying down on the couch with both of her hands on her ever protruding stomach seeming to be faintly listening to the conversation being carried on by her mum and aunt mrs potter and her sister in law were sitting on a shorter sofa situated on the farthest left side of the living room so that it looked over the rest of the room so it was no mistake when mrs potter eyes flickered to me from her spot on the couch when i stepped into the room mr potter and mac could be heard laughing probably as they poured themselves a drink from mr potter study i felt awkward standing there but there was no where else to sit unless i joined mrs potter mary on the couch which was not going to happen and there was james sitting in a reclining armchair that was against the wall that the doorway to the room was on so that when i first came in i didnteven see the chair out of the corner of my eye jenn offered me a smile even though i had not spoken a word to her and i returned it mrs potter and james aunt mary went on talking with no acknowledgement towards me except for that once my arms at my sides and my lips pursed into an almost pout i turned to james all basked in the shadows of the room i shook my head slightly just to silently ask what there was i could say or if me standing there in front of him would mean anything he looked up at me almost lazily and in an uninterested fashion i pushed my lips out to the point where they felt as if they were about to overrun with words that i had not intended for them to just there at the tip of my tongue and the base of my lips were a thousand words i was subconciously willing to throw at the 18 year old boy as i went to open my mouth he extended an arm and gestured to me there room for two he muttered quiet enough for nobody else to hear i tilted my head slightly and pressed my lips hard together as he brought his arm back and folded them about his chest my eyes were wide and perhaps expectant as i moved towards the chair while he brought it to an upright sitting position with a tug of the handle on the side the footrest lowered and the back of the chair sat straight as he scooted over closer to the right arm of the chair making room for me he didntseem to pay attention to me as i sat down to the left of him as his gaze was focused intently on the television and not on me i situated myself so very close to this boy despite the size of the chair and when i quit moving he moved the handle again and the footrest came up as the chair went back he stretched his feet out on the rest and his head was against a crook in the corner of the chair cushion acting as a pillow not knowing just how comfortable i was to get or just why i was sharing a chair with him i struggled to stay sitting up straight when i felt his fingers tracing over my wrist though i almost automatically leaned back into a half laying down position like he was unlike earlier that day when he had squeezed my wrist until i showed him the other picture this was done in a endearing comforting sort of way i stared straight ahead shutting my eyes briefly when my head came to touch against the back of the chair and i lay my feet on the footrest alongside his his mezmerizing touch was gone almost as soon as it had come something like most of james potter and his characteristics and i held my breath only for a moment listening to mrs potter and mary continue their conversation as if these two teenages didntexist as if we didntexist it could ve been a lifetime it could ve been five minutes it could ve meant the world it could ve meant nothing that undeniable warmth radiating off of him could ve been a blaze of fury or a blaze of appreciation this could ve been sweet surrender this could ve been a bittersweet end this could be the beginning of something i had not intended to begin this could be james potter in love this could be james potter in hate this could have been so many things what a time for me to be absolutely blind what a time for me to be eighteen and so so stupid and i would have given so much for it to just stay like this stay something but nothing at the same time on the edge of more but not there yet so sharing a chair didntmatter i did not know what to say or how to say it when i felt his arm shift though everything seemed to whirl into my mind and take my breath for a moment i twisted and turned until i was closer to him with his arm around my shoulders laying on my side my face found itself pressed against the slight curve in his neck as he watched the television his skin was warm and he was clean shaven and the scent of his soap and shampoo was still so very there i took a deep breath that turned out shaky and it was strange how i thought smelling him was too intimate his neck looking so incredible was too intimate james i muttered absolutely hopelessly not knowing how this could get better or worse how these moments could possibly turn into anything else how there was anything left to say how somewhere out there things were happening changing and shifting and it was a hard hit to think about how drastically things at home had changed how i didntbelong there here or seemingly anywhere my half hearted utter of his name did not go disregarded his hazel green eyes locked with my own and he looked positively serious he didntoffer any words he didntquestion me he just kept eye contact until i first blinked and then he followed suite as if deciding actions right now would speak louder than words he tightened his arm around me and pulled me in closer pressing his mouth and chin into my hair and peered over the top of my head i assumed at his glancing mum he offered me a heavy sigh that resulted in a puff of warm breath meeting the side of my face and ear and i glanced up and to the side to see him out of the corner of my eye caught up in that moment i mistook him for a man i glanced up saw the side of his face half of it disappearing behind my red waves and i saw that mystery i saw that mystery that james potter was and i saw it for everything it was he was eighteen and tonight he looked it tonight he seemed it tonight unlike this morning when i read jocelyn letter he seemed eighteen and smooth and something about him was fluent it could ve been the rather intriguing rythm of his breathing or it could ve been the way his face remained decidedly pensive and the cleft just above his top lip seemed to protrude just a bit more making him even more handsome but now wasntthe time for anybody to be handsome or appealing or what i needed because i didnteven know what i needed and what i needed was susceptible to change like every aspect of every one of us was susceptible to change we were seventeen or eighteen and it was december and we were all oh you know immersed so deeply in our dramas that we were absolutely oblivious to the fact that this couldntbe it none of us were going to work out the way we thought and it a shame we didntknow that before we went through everything we were going to today had killed me in so many ways and i swore swore it had to be past midnight it can t ve been only 8 o clock in the evening the shortest day of the year and the sun had been gone for hours it had set so fast i didntget a chance to notice it it was winter god damn solstice possibly the most gorgeous day of the year in all of it respectable frosty temperatures james birthday and here we were here i was not even knowing why we bothered to break for christmas once you were over fourteen it all changed everything changed it didntmean as much i was eighteen and practically a veteran to the holiday scene and i was hoping against some kind of false hope that it would be magical and everything it hadntbeen for years but i didntknow i didntknow how to feel like that again i didntknow who i was i was hurt i think i think i had good reason to be i think i was too confused to feel anything but hurt i had thrown myself out on the line that line seperating the marauders from the rest of us and i had been exposed and i had been thwarted any half assed attempts i was going to have with any of them had been slowly destroyed right before my eyes by them the sad thing was i thought my problems were the biggest ones in the world at the moment nothing could hurt sting feel like this did this abandonned even if james was right here too close this alone even if i had lied to myself and said they were my friends for the passed few months nothing could feel like this i told myself could it get any worse my thoughts were petty and selfish and a part of me was begging james to stop them the thoughts to tell me there were lives that were being more messed up then our own because there were there was so much he knew and so much he wasnttelling me so am i a man today lily james asked quietly a ghost of a grin playing across his delicious looking lips and i quirked my own into a small smile as he adjusted his head so he could look at me without inhaling my hair you re eighteen whatever that is to you i guess my hand came to rest on his upper arm and he flinched slightly at the feel of my cold palms but he didntpull away eighteen could be anything i mean do you look at me and see anything more than a child i sat up a bit craning my neck around and staring at him straight in the eye then my gaze flickered to his slightly long nose and then to his lips and then his neck and i swallowed before answering right now yes and i suppose i could return the question you know am i a girl am i a woman i trailed off smiling slightly as i mussed my hair up something he would do i think my answer would be more complicated than yours he started quietly taking his arm from around my shoulders and folding them behind his head as he stared at the ceiling i tried to not dwell on my suddenly bare feeling shoulders and told myself that there was no sudden lack of warmth because his arm wasntthere i could not need him or find so much comfort in him and i wouldn t you are god no james you don t have to give some speech on how i look like shut up he interrupted with a small smile and i shook my head letting him continue you ve got this innocent aspect to you your smile i guess your skin is absolutely incredible you look so unflawed but then your eyes they match that innocent persona to perfection but you get one good look at them and there this sudden whirl of emotions and it like i seeing your world it like you re more of a woman than so many i know but because you appear so wide eyed it more polite to look at you and say yeah she a nice girl so i dontknow lily evans you re a woman who trying to be a girl it seems i tilted my head and looked at him seriously waiting for him to look away from the ceiling and back at me i not a nice girl though i just not i shrugged and sat fully up practically turning myself around so i was sitting backwards in the chair in order to face him i wish i was like you described me open your eyes james you canttrust me you cantlook at me without doubting me you cantpossibly believe i am all wide eyed and innocent donttalk like that just because you re trying to keep me from hurting so much he offered swiftly his tone of voice almost icily smooth and just then i couldntquite pull my eyes away from him and i did feel very much wide eyed i was afraid for one blinding moment before the words spilled out i couldntstop them this was quite truthfully the beginning of that cycle ask him lily escape let leave his eyebrows rose as thses words simply tumbled out let just go away from here anywhere you want to run from everything everything but you just you and i we could do it it could be perfect we need to get to know one another get inside the others head before i could go on the chair was in the upright position and he took me by the crook of my elbow and pulled me from the room with a cease of conversation from the other three occupants of that room and into the hallway out of sight stop it he said gently yet firmly come on let just go it would be so amazing his hands flew to his hair and he looked at me incredulously you re taking it all you re becoming everything i wanted to be you re the one who messes up you re the one who looks good you re the one who stablizes this friendship and now you re the one with the crazy teenage ideas that i supposed to have we re not we re not leaving here you re not running we dontneed to be inside each others heads more than we already are finishing sentences for christ sake lily dontdo this dontdo this i nodded and any sudden glow and heat about me had drained and i was feeling stupid as his hands came to grip my upper arms like remus had not long before and this time i offered what i should have been i sorry as hoarse as it was it was there and as hoarse as we were we were there we werentbroken but could have been he was too good to me and the day was going to draw to a close whether he forgave me or not whether he d let me ask the hundreds of questions i wanted to ask about him and jocelyn and i was trying to tell my mind that the sex question wouldntbe the best one to first throw out and i was trying to tell my mind that worrying about whatever was going on out there in that world of magic would get me no where james would tell me and for some reason i wasntnear happy with my faith in him i didntwant to know anything that would make me older than i needed to be i didntwant to be one of those i didntwant our world to change drastically yet it would though it would abc chapter 14 death on a window ledge btw they re still standing in the hallway after lily begged him to escape and then apologized james looked at me with a clenched jaw for one impossible second then a muscle twitched in that clenched jaw and he swallowed before offering me a small nod that insignificant slight inclination of his head was what i needed the permission i needed to continue on with my apology to subdue my insanity for the moment i feel as if i ve missed out on too much to consider myself a part of your life i just thought maybe reading the letter would give me some sort of half assed insight into you she knew you she was with you maybe reading it i d discover if you were real i know curiousity doesntexcuse me reading the letter i just felt insane because i didntknow you forever i want to know you that well but i dontknow if i have any right to come with me his eyes burned hazel and then he was taking my hand and we were running up stairs through hallways up more stairs through another hallway up a last set of stairs halfway down another hallway turn to the left and through a large doorway we finally stopped he let go of my hand and i looked around the large room i hadntbeen yet somehow and of course we ended up on the 4th floor of the house the one i hadntyet taken the chance to explore it was dark in this particular room given the time of night and the lack of lighting but i could make out how empty it was how the floor was wood and was like some even expanse that had been waxed and polished once forgotten about and never walked over again the room was huge seemingly empty and had one large window on the wall to the right of the doorway there was a ruby red rug in the middle of the room and on top of that rug was a black piano the cover was down over the keys and the whole thing seemed to shine eerily in the pouring moonlight james had been bent over while he caught his breath and i looked around then he stood straight and i turned and met his stare with a perplexed one of my own there was something unsettling about how he looked so dark and his facial expression so set and hard the speed at which his chest was rising and falling had slowed but it was still protruding a bit more with each breath and it made his shoulders seem somewhat more broad and him seem even taller he looked stubborn and slightly frustrated as there was a small crease in his forehead from his frown what is it he shook his head taking a step around me in the direction of the window nothing i scoffed turning around to follow him obviously it something you drag me up here i paused to look around the room in which our voices seemed to echo loudly didntlet me finish talking and now you re looking at me like i some kind of lost lonely little girl james finished my sentence that was not to be finished i didntknow exactly what he was looking at me like it was just one of those times you trailed off a sentence leaving the imagination open to wander and to consider just what exactly he was looking at me like but no he finished it and the look on his face when he finished it was demeaning i felt as if i d never live up to any expectations he may or may not have for me i felt as if i was suddenly apparent to him like he was just seeing me for the first time you talk like that the worst thing in the world i could be i murmured putting a hand to my warm forehead i dontknow james there are times when you are so undeniably mine i read the letter i an idiot i said i was sorry i just needed some reassurance that you were so undeniably yours james lips hardly seemed to move but were doing so so hardly that they looked so lovely and embellished god just i turned on my heel prepared to leave the room without even knowing why he brought me here in the first place but then he was walking towards the window again and made a quick gesture for me to follow i of course did as cold as he had suddenly turned i couldntresist the little bit of mischevious mystery there seemed to be about him right now all washed in moonlight and looking faded but so inammissible neither of us said another word and i asked no questions as he climbed up onto the cushioned window seat beneath the window and the length of it the window was long and wide and you could pull each side of it open seperately with a twist of the handles that were on each side i had hardly realized what he was doing before he had done it before he was out there standing on the window ledge looking down come up here he said quietly to me as i stood on the cushion of the window seat looking up the short space to him james grabbed onto my hand and helped me up onto the ledge this was insane we were so far up the ledge wasntthat wide i could fall i could fall i could die and this is incredible i whispered as james hand left my own and he gripped the side of the window frame looking out over the rooftops and everything else we could see just listen lily he muttered after a moment and i held my breath listening hard there were no sounds coming from the room behind us we couldnthear anything else in the house he was breathing quiet and we were both standing as still as anything the night was cold too cold for snow too cold for a wind to muster up nothing moved the blanket of snow was thin and seemed a world away as i looked down at the ground that seemed to be shimmering due to the near full moon there were no lights on to the house next door there were cars along nearby streets and highways but you couldnthear the traffic it was just so quiet listen to it there nothing there you he stopped speaking and things became quiet for one second again as if to remind me what there wasntany of no sound there me and this is untouchable i got caught up in his words and watching the river of cars tail lights drift on and away from this one window in london drift away from us the city lights werentfar off but far enough that you could look at them admiringly rather than hate them with some passion because here you werentthrown into the mix of a city that never sleeps where street lights and flashing signs seem to never go out where people dontrest because their minds are too full and caffeine has become more important to them than breathing itself here in this rich little suburb it was peaceful it was full of big houses and neighbours who didntknow one another and it was so quiet at night you could probably go walking down the middle of the street without having to worry of any cars and from here all of the misfortunes of everyone else seemed so far off and you forgot just how the city could chew you up and spit you out you forgot all of that and you just saw the city lights and they looked like beautiful illuminating fireflies of winter lighting the way for the ones who were lost i think standing here realizing this was in fact untouchable and seeing the world like james apparently had seen it many times before it was more magical than anything i had seen at hogwarts how cold it was didntseem to reach us up here nothing did nothing penetrated too deeply and the only reason i shivered was when i saw how frosty white my breath was floating up to the midnight navy sky sooner or later not really paying much attention to how long we had been standing on the edge of either the beginning of our lives or our deaths i saw that james expression softened a bit and you knew he really loved this because his eyes were burning and well i fell in love with something that night amongst the frosty air and winter at it finest why did you want to leave lily i faintly heard him ask and i finally blinked turning my head slightly to see him with folded arms and leaning against the frame of the large window i said i was sorry i answered quickly looking away from hin you were apologizing for that then for wanting to leave i could ve swore you had been apologizing for reading jocelyn letter well i was exactly you were apologizing for reading jocelyn letter you explained why you read jocelyn letter you didntexplain why you wanted to leave you didntgo there you ignored it like you hadntjust had some sort of break down pleading with me to leave i scoffed and felt my nose sting with how cold it was getting get over yourself i wasntpleading with yes you were james interrupted me and there was a sense of finality in the air no more interrupting no arguing with him because yes i had i had pleaded with him in a moment of temporary insane weakness and if i could go back and keep myself composed i would ve what is it about here that you hate so much that you wanted to leave my gaze was unblinking and my eyes had began to water but as i sank into an unintentional moment of thought the watering ceased and it was as if i wasntseeing that magical night sky at all anymore i was just seeing days gone by and trying to place what it was i hated so much what i hated about all of this any of this i sighed and blinked excessively after a moment it not so much what i hate about here there nothing i hate about here this world this life it more about what i missing out there what i could experience and feel and live outside of this place you know sometimes i just think why not finishing quietly i looked down at my feet and felt quite prepared to climb down off of this ledge now and go bury myself in a mass of covers and pillows and sleep right through til june i could feel him watching me and it wasntsomething i minded it was something comforting surprisingly or i guess i just felt like that gaze of his was understanding of a sort blazing maybe intense perhaps but understanding yeah it was a minute or two before he said anything breaking the heavy quiet that completely surrounded this window ledge his voice was quiet and his breathing was quiet and his stare had been quiet and his stance was quiet there was a bit of that james potter who had somehow been lost in the past couple of months there was bit of him shining through right now i understand i nodded and folded my arms taking one more look at the view from up here on top of the world this is god my voice was airy and simple and the end of our conversation as i stepped down onto the window seat and left james potter to his own thoughts at minutes to 9 o clock on the night of his eighteenth it seemed good for the both of us to think about the affect we had on each other up there dancing with death on a window ledge the twenty first of december two days later never seemed to exist nothing seemed to have been exchanged between james and myself and the other two marauders hadntbeen around since that day a lot of sleeping seemed to be caught up on by every person who had been deprived of it and the christmas tree was suddenly there in the living room in a corner of the room when we woke up one morning that morning being the 23rd oh it brilliant i declared in a way much less conservative than i had been around this family as i first seen the large christmas tree that was slowly being loaded with decorations mrs potter stood at a container magicking some on but james lexi and jude were putting some on by hand it is isntit i used to bloody well hate waiting this long to put it up but it seems just a bit more magical jude said giving me a grin as he placed an ornament on the tree and turned to me would you like a mug of apple cider of course it was apple cider warm apple cider spiking the air with it delicious aroma and it was one that was so stuck there in my head stirring all of these memories but i just couldntplace it when i was stood at the top of the stairs before coming down that morning apple cider it was almost comforting to know i could take a scent like most people and connect it with a nice memory from my childhood i had nice memories from my childhood yes please i pulled the sleeves of my sweatshirt down over my hands as jude left for the kitchen and i looked at the tree closer it was sure to be magnificent at the rate the decorations were being loaded on to it all strategically placed like the rightful spots for them hadntchange in years nice of you to join us mrs potter chimed in during the few minutes jude was gone from the room and her voice was dripping with sarcasm i sighed and stared at my feet tugging on the sleeves of the sweatshirt more as i grew uncomfortable for the past couple of days i was able to avoid mrs potter they had been out to all sorts of gatherings and there was just never any reason for me to speak to her it didntmake things any more enjoyable though there was some tension lingering in the air that was not supposed to be there at christmas time you werentsupposed to feel so judged and exposed and i just didntlike it it only eight thirty i drawled back to her reaching down for an ornament as james stepped out of the way to make room for me not looking in my direction instead turning to his mother i tried to ignore the burning stare that i could feel on my back as i went up on tiptoe to put the ornament i had chosen on i tilted my head and studied it grinning as things started feeling just a bit like a traditional christmas that one doesntgo there danielle snapped at me just as i heard james begin to speak to her i turned to look at her as she brushed by her son and i raised my eyebrows you might as well not bother helping at all it ll just have to be changed such a nuisance she muttered the last bit under her breath and i felt terribly stricken i went to raise my eyebrows further but they crumbled down as an unintentionally hurt frown took it place over my face i sorry i quickly apologized and i heard lexi sigh and blow her hair out of her face turning to look at her mother as she waved her wand and the ornament i had placed floated down to one branch lower that was indeed a slap in the face perhaps i shouldnthelp then i said as pleasantly as somebody could while blowing up on the inside and i went over to sit on the couch perhaps not mrs potter said in the same sugar sweet tone i was using as mr potter came back into the room handing me my mug of cider james i noticed was conveniently having trouble with the hooks on one of the ornaments and just couldnt pull his eyes away you know to observe the situation of his apparent best friend getting berated by his mother through sarcastic muttering he d ignore it if i didntsay anything if i sat here quietly he wouldntbother mentioning it it was just the one thing that we couldntdo talk about his mother we had tried to that first morning i was here but it just ended in bloody knuckles and him telling me i was paranoid everything all right jude asked good naturedly as he went to helping mrs potter magically apply ornament everything s fine i said quietly as james turned his head slightly just enough for him to meet my eyes and i pressed my lips hard together shrugging my shoulders and offering an expression that easily read what can you do thanks for looking out for me james i wouldn t make him though i wouldntwhine and request that he stick up for me against his mother i wasntabout to ask him to fight my battles i d do it on my own i just wasntso sure i d get through this one alive i wasntso sure that i wanted to get through this one alive which made no sense but at the same time made all the sense in the world why would i not want to win a battle against my best friend mother why wouldnti want to win her over like i won him over and build some sort of mother daughter like relationship with her why wouldnti want to grow close to somebody who i may find myself around in the years to come i suppose a part of me really didn t a part of me really didntsee james as the proper definition of a best friend if he was a best friend his mother would understand that and we would get along a part of me really didntwant to win this i d rather just sit it out let it pass because honestly why would it matter after these holidays would i ever see her again it was so wrong of me to be considering the end of my friendship with james when it had hardly begun i was trying to see june trying to see us graduating vowing to stay in touch and us doing so i was trying to see us as best friends after hogwarts it was just too hard to do i couldntimagine myself with sirius after hogwarts i could hardly imagine myself with him during these few months there were times throughout these couple of weeks when i didntknow why i was bothering with them why i was here what i was doing why i had made that declartion of best friendship to james so desperately needing him to say it back like he had the only reason for bothering with all of this that i could come up with was the simplest thing there was was something so very there but not it was for james it was for james the one who looked awkwardly on as his darling mother drove me further and further into the ground or further and further away from him dear lily how re the holidays going for you at the potter s personally i d be too nervous to talk to them afraid i d make a fool out of myself i cantbelieve it christmas eve the days just seeme to fly by yesterday was absolutely pointless i think during the holidays there should be no twenty third of december because everybody finished up everything if they re not it doesntmatter if they have an extra day or not their presents will probably suck anyway so it should go right from the twenty second to christmas eve ease the anticipation a bit i an absolute child when it comes to christmas so kiss any boys lately ray was over here yesterday but i was still bored i sat around for half of the time staring at the christmas tree and at all of my presents again kiss any boys lately i d imagine you ve kissed one of two i dontknow who you re with anymore or not with is it sirius or james these days anyways i should let you go my hand cramping up i was going to buy you a present i wasntjust entirely sure what to get you so i thought a letter from me would be present enough happy holidays bridget i whole heartedly agreed with her the twenty third of december was a waste of a day it should ve been skipped and forgotten about and just not there at all especially my twenty third of december it didntimprove any after that morning of an almost confrontation with mrs potter it was just a quiet day around the house for once mr mrs potter went away early in the afternoon while james and myself assumed the position of babysitter for lexi that was until he bailed on me when melly came over which made no sense to me because i thought she was like the built in babysitter or something but no i just played with lexi most of the day until she went to bed at 8 o clock and i found there was no way to get out of going to the living room to hang out with james and melly the two of them had been sitting on the couch james with his feet up on the coffee table and melly was leaning her head against the arm of the couch there was a holiday special on television and we just quietly watched it as the night grew darker the only source of light being the glow from the screen of the television thanks for looking after lexi today james had said to me at some point without bothering to look at me without making it seem sincere i just nodded and curled up into the chair more picking at the sleeve of my shirt feeling melly gaze on me i going to get a drink anybody want anything james shook his head as i did too melly left the room and i realized she wasntas tall as i had orginally thought well she was but we were probably about the same height and i wasntnecessarily short but she somehow pulled it off she just seemed to float along with her head held higher than i could ever imagine holding mine and she was so graceful her long hair swayed along with her and her strides were probably two times the length of my own i was just awkward having such red hair and such green eyes and being so lanky she had a nice straight stance and held her shoulders back easily whereas i d have to remind myself to sit up straight i was sitting there moving my shoudlers uncomfortably as i considered my appearance until i caught sight of james giving me a rather amused grin what are you doing he asked and i folded my arms sitting still again i ve just decided in the last minute that i lanky and have an awkward posture he narrowed his eyes as he considered me and tilted his head leaning it back against the couch i dontthink you do i just think it how you feel you look both of us looked to melly as she came back into the room with a glass of juice but maybe you should actually look at how you look and you ll realize you re he shrugged wrong and that night the twenty third of december after no further conversation with james and turning in early to bed i did look at myself just stood there in the full length mirror wearing a pair of pajama pants and a tank top i looked at my reflection i stood a little straighter and pulled my hair up examining all 5 5 of me i lifted my chin and kept my lips set in a serious pout taking in the length of my neck and the curve of my collarbone my neck was completely bare i hadntwore a necklace for a few days for some reason it seemed like it had been years ago not a month since sirius had given me that necklace that matched his eyes maybe james was right i just felt lanky and tired looking especially when i was around a girl like melly who just seemed to radiate some sort of blinding beauty and it was hard being jealous of her or hard hating her she was just so nice and hardly seemed aware of the way she presented herself so easily it was a bit of a comfort to think that maybe she looked on to me the same way i did to her wanting her chestnut coloured hair with all of those auburn highlights maybe she wanted my red hair maybe she wanted my skin colour maybe she thought i was pretty but it didntmatter if she did or not because james did in fact say i was beautiful at one point that all that mattered at times when i d compare myself james potter had said it christmas eve started out mad the house was busy and awake and loud and i woke with some sort of determination i pulled on a sweatshirt and a pair of socks and left my room in my pajamas as tense as yesterday had been it was still nice to feel it in the air feel the impending christmas morning feel the unspoken excitement from everybody feel the love that somebody had for somebody else in the house not everybody loved everybody there but you knew you were loved cared about or needed by at least one other and that was a comfort i had not felt for so long but here it was just lingering in the christmas eve morning atmosphere pancakes toast waffles or all three jude asked as i stepped into the kitchen and was automatically handed a plate oh um waffles please i grinned at him and he returned it as he put two waffles onto my plate from the stack that was sitting on the counter everybody is everywhere so just make yourself comfortable he wiped his hands clean as i poured maple syrup onto my waffles and i nodded thank you i said genuinely grateful for a friendly morning he didntleave me to my pouring of maple syrup though the grin left his face and he looked rather serious as a hand leapt to his bald head and he rubbed it over it dani means well was all he said not even beginning the conversation in any other way it fine jude there was the strangest sensation that coursed through me for a moment like i had known this man forever or i would know this man forever or this would just be the beginning of these momentary one on one with him i blinked heavily to rid myself of it and thought it must ve just been because i had actually called him by his first name and felt adult like because of that i dontexpect to spend much time around her after these holidays anyway i felt rather than saw the air of surprise he held as an eyebrow raised slowly and he folded his arms because you dontlike her he ventured a guess and i just shook my head smiling slightly no i mean after this yea does james mean something to you lily jude pressed and i noticed that james probably had more creases in his forehead than this man did he does yes i answered looking away from him and down at my plate does james mean something to me it would come to be a common question amongst jude and myself when i was doubting things then i think you should make peace with his mother with my wife i can tell you now i dontthink either of you are going to let this go as easily as you seem to think you may you wouldntbe bothering lily dear to come home with the boy for the holidays if you didntwant your friendship to evolve after this i met jude stare and wasntsurprised or startled by it it was so much like james s we ll talk later jude left me to my breakfast as mac his brother in law called him over laughing at something someone said i wouldntbe bothered if i didntwant our friendship that determination i had woke with didntfade yet and i was still feeling rather energetic and prepared due to it so as jude walked over to talk to mac i brushed by him and took an empty seat at the dining room table right next to mrs potter james aunt uncle and cousin were over again today and mary was talking to jenn as i sat down at the table next to mrs potter i smiled at them as mrs potter buttered a piece of toast and completely ignored my presence your son means something to me i began as randomly and quietly as i could and your husband seems to think this wontbe it this wontbe the only time you ever see me i d really like if it wasn t i d really like if you d believe that i not some joke i d admire your determination but you might as well just not bother as much as you d like to think that maybe your friendship with him is a sure thing we both know you re better off not trying to make things work failing and ending up humiliated what are you getting at mrs potter seemed to refused to offer me a direct glance and kept herself busy with pouring herself another cup of tea and buttering herself a biscuit i didntwant to look at her either so i just stared off somewhere near the pitcher of orange juice before pouring myself a glass you re just not good enough for him a sudden shock ran through my body as i paused for a second and let her words register with me abandoning any previous decision to keep this conversation as subtle and quiet as possible i whirled around in my chair fully turning my body so i was sitting staring at her pardon i asked shrilly and in a way she probably thought was pathetic and weak all right a deep voice interrupted what could become dangerous between the two of us and a firm grip on my upper arm called me from the icy depths of mrs potter eyes come have a smoke with me lily it was remus gently coaxing me into a standing position from which i looked down at mrs potter and firmly reminded him i did not smoke i didntneed another reason for her to hate me i dontsmoke ohkay let go have a good cry come on sirius and james were in the living room i hardly realized as we left the kitchen made our way down the hall and stood at the coat rack you could see into the living room and i offered a brief glance before remus jacket was draped over my shoulders and he was leading me with very little persuasion out of the front door and i had been right that first morning i met dani the way she stared at me with all of the scrutiny in the world i remember thinking it was like i wasntgood enough i wasn t of course how could i be how could i think i d be good enough how could james think she d tolerate me not to mention adore me why did this feel like the single most impossible thing person situation i had ever come up against why did james potter make me so fucking hopeless remus turned to me as we stood on the top step took a cigarette out of his jacket pocket and lit it with his wand smoke issued from the end of it and i threw myself down onto the concrete step hunching over with my head in my hands it not any fair you know i didn t i didnteven do anything i trailed off realizing he was the last person who d want to hear me go on about how i wasntbeing accepted or trusted or whatever because he was so hesitant to accept or trust me and just dammit she just treating me like like shit she treating you like shit lily he took a long drag off of the cigarette and i could smell the harsh smoke meet my nose as he blew it out and you take it you haventproved her wrong lils you haventproved that you are in fact good enough if you were good enough for him for that family you would ve stood up said something proved yourself because that family all about proving themselves ask james he been proving himself since the day he was born what do you want me to do remus i shouted though it was more like some muffled cry as i had my head buried away in my hands i cantprove myself to somebody when i dontknow what i trying to prove or when i canteven prove to myself who i am why should i have to prove anything to her james is my friend there is absolutely nothing else i should have to say to her you re right remus said simply as i turned to look at him with a dark frown he threw his cigarette down onto the step and trodded on it to put it out i watched as he shrugged his shoulders and kept his gaze out on the street looking past me he would say i was right and then twist it horribly so that i was right but in a completely wrong way he d just do something to make me wrong in a way because he wouldntgive anything up without a fight you are so right all you should ve had to do was smile at dani the first morning you met her shook her hand or hugged her and introduced yourself as james newly found friend lily who was so pleased to be invited home with him for the holidays you shouldnthave to prove that you re nothing more and that you re not trying to steal him away you shouldnt as long as she knows and heard it from you and as long as you introduced yourself like that then none of this is your fault i looked away from him shaking my head slowly my nostrils widening for a moment and stinging with some rush of emotion he was of course turning it around to be my fault it was my fault i didntact like some comfortable adjusted warm pleasant girl when i first met her it was my fault i didntcasually throw the fact that james and i were just friends into every conversation i had with her remus was of course going to ask if i had told mrs potter that i was just friends with james so the last fact of the matter is did you tell dani firmly that your just friends with james and did you keep your hands to yourself while being around him remus was smiling easily smoothly and with all the charm a bitter resentful boy like him could have i wasnteven looking at him but i just could feel how twistedly proud he was of himself for proving me wrong and kicking me while i was already down i didnttell her remus that i was just friends and i didntdistance myself a lot from james when we were around her because oh i d like to hear this one because i not enough i haventbeen since the second i walked in that door the second i met her the second i left diagon alley the second i saw the for sale sign on my lawn the second i became anything to james potter i became less to myself and it doesnt matter what i say to her it doesntmatter if we re just friends that woman is as stubborn as hell and she will only hear what she wants to hear and she does not want to hear that i a half decent god damn person i stood up gestured with my hands and was half an inch from his face shouting with blood rushing to my legs my hands and my head making me dizzy with all sorts of things realization that the last paragraph i had just spat out was complete truth and i hadnteven thought about it before hand and it people like you remus that encourages people like her to hate people like me i shook my head shrugged my shoulders and offered a tight lipped sad smile to the boy with creases in his forehead and that boy who had eyes of an experienced man had nothing at all to say as i threw the door open and left him out there to be one with the bitter cold that matched him almost to perfection lily i had ignored the persistently ignored the banging on the bathroom door for the last 5 minutes just like i had persistently ignored the knocking on the bedroom door for 5 minutes until surrendering to take a shower where the knocking was not as hard to ignore with the streaming water blocking the sound out the door not locked lily i heard him say in a rather business like tone the knocking ceasing and how would you know i asked in an airy tone that was sure not to be heard correctly as i massaged shampoo into my hair because there no damn lock on the door he replied with one more thud to the door i sighed and shut my eyes turning away from the showerhead and leaning my head back to rinse the shampoo as much as i didnt want to talk to him i had to admit it was rather exhilirating with him on the other side of the bathroom door when i was taking a warm shower and denying him the one thing he would want conversation i had been starving for it all day or rather my subconcious had the rest of me wanted to ignore him pack my bag catch a bus and just go back to hogwarts for the remainder of the holidays but christmas was tomorrow and i wasntknown for being a rude girl so i thought why not try to stake it out make it as painful for them as possible but it was harder to ignore him than i had thought it would be because he was the one person i was usually not ignoring and talking to about ignoring people and making things better we were meant to argue make up and be better than before making that bond closer it didntfeel right though going to the one who was almost deliberately keeping me on the outside of christmas with his family in order to get a sense of false security why go to him like everything was all right when he was the one who was making this almost unbearable i had avoided james much of the day as well as sirius and remus though avoiding them was a bit simpler since i wasntreally on good terms with either of them now i forced conversation with james aunt and uncle though was a bit intimidated by his cousins warm smiles so i didnttalk to her it was probably nearing 7 o clock in the evening and i was feeling rather let down i couldntcome up with a reason for me not to be this was absolute hell really you re not coming in here i said simply folding my arms once i had completely rinsed my hair and stood directly beneath the showerhead just letting my skin tingle due to the excessive warmth of the water like hell i not you cantavoid me in there we need to talk he sounded rather firm and serious but he never did come through the door without my permission not once ever not throughout our lives did james walk through a closed door without knocking first and that something you have to respect but in thinking what about james potter didntdeserve respect it was unfair truthfully the way his hair always was messed up and the way his hazel eyes said more than he did at times and the way his voice was so pleasantly deep but could be so shrill in moments of desperation it was unfair that the tiniest details about that boy man james was admired and looked at and inspected with more care than most people pay to their own lives speaking on behalf of myself and myself only of course i think there isntanything about him that isntrespected maybe it was just me well chances have it it just me it just me who canthelp but notice the way his filtrum a n cleft in your upper lip is more pronounced than most others and it just me who canthelp but notice that little tick he has with brushing his index finger beneath his right cheek and it me who canthelp but notice the way he regards a person just the way everything about him radiates so much integrity and raw honest emotion that is so irreplaceable you wonder if you can even live a day without him and it just me who respected my best friend i dontthink anybody else did respected their best friend the one person in life they stand beside for years the one person they beat down and bring up and who sees them at their worse i dontknow why i respected my best friend and put so much into depending on him to be incredible because i was only sure to be disappointed with the way i wanted the world holding my head rather high for an awkward girl who recognized that awkwardness who was wrapped in nothing but a towel i left the bathroom to go into the bedroom to get dressed james had given up and thank god for it him being so hesitant and unsure of himself made me momentarily dignified and sure of myself he had left without conversation without saying a word more without wanting to know anything without needing to know anything i pulled the door open not realizing how suffocating the bathroom had felt until cool air from the bedroom met me and i shivered rather occupied with looking down at the trail of water i was tracking over the carpet i failed to notice him just sitting there on the bed up against the backboard reading one of my books looking up i stopped in my tracks and almost lost my grip on the towel before regaining it and pulling it tighter dontlook at me i said shrilly raising my eyebrows high in surprise as he looked up from the book we need to talk james said quickly averting his gaze back to the book too bad i scoffed calmly standing rigidly and just daring him to look up which of course he did shut your eyes well if you d put some bloody clothes on he interruped me in a shout shutting his eyes as he did throw me that sweater i told him taking a deep breath and willing myself not to turn and run back to the bathroom he felt around for the sweater that i was referring to laying on the floor near the bed and when he couldntfind it he opened his eyes picked it up and tossed it to me i dontthink he realized his rather wandering gaze was quite noticeable james i gritted out and he looked away sharply closing his eyes firmly if you so much as blink i muttered turning my back on him and sliding the towel down to wrap around my waist as i quickly pulled the sweatshirt on your shampoo smells really good he said with either a yawn or a sigh i wasntsure i however did sigh as i turned around with the sweatshirt on and the towel acting as a skirt what do you want james once again james opened his eyes and looked at me i mean really looked at me like he was seeing me without blinders on for the first time seeing me with sopping wet hair that was plastered to the side of my neck soaking the shoulders of the sweatshirt and a rouge to my cheeks due to the warmth of the bathroom and my legs with water droplets sliding down them james was seeing me as some kind of exposed and taking the oppurtunity to realize it to realize i wasntas able as i liked to pretend i was not able to hold the weight of the world anyway i can to talk do you think you can hide away in the bedroom all day and nobody d notice he didntlook at me while he talked however instead he stood up and straightened the bottom of his t shirt oh so somebody noticed did they i said airily folding my arms and looking interestedly at my bare feet stop being passive aggressive and look at me when we re talking would you raising my eyebrows sleekly and leaving my eyes rather lidded and innocent looking i brought my gaze to him perhaps that an order both of us should follow i shrugged and he let out a rather frustrated sigh it wasntan order lily just shut up would you it had come from my mouth before i had a chance to reason with myself and think about it it what i wanted him to do honestly but not just him everybody my own thoughts even all right evans he rumpled his hair and something that resembled exhausted satisfaction leapt into my throat at the familiarity of that one simple action we wonttalk then nice sweatshirt by the way his voice was soft hoarse and i liked to think struggling to stay calm i wanted him to blow up at me put me in my place explain my life to me i wanted him to give me some sort of reassurance that he wasntbacking out of this that i wasntreally a hopeless case james turned to go and i made a single sound of protest that was easily overlooked by him and when he shut the door just a bit harder than normal i realized the sweatshirt i was wearing was the one i had kept that was his i shut my fluttery eyelids as a shudder wracked through my body my hands were clenched at my sides and when did this room get so big when did i get so small why was james so tall why cantwe just leave sometimes you smile so much your whole face hurts not in a good way not in an accomplished way you dontfeel your face hurting from smiling so much and think wow tonight was just so good i just couldntstop smiling that must be why my face hurts no it when you ve put on those wide fake grins for almost an hour that your face starts to hurt you smile those fake smiles when you feel oblivious cold shouldered and stupid to the rest of the world well my face hurt and i had been sitting in the den with jude mac mary and jenn for not quite an hour it was almost ten o clock and i think the main reason i surrendered there was because james sirius and remus were in the living room and mrs potter was trying to make lexi get settled down so she wouldntbe that tired on christmas morning melly had also joined the party at 8 o clock or so and was likely in the living room with the marauders plus all of the questions they threw my way were appreciated i got to talk about me and think about something other than arguments things were going well as fine as they could be for me at the moment and even though i had fake smiled one too many times i was all right mrs potter brother and sister in law were nice enough i just wondered why it didntrun in the family jenn was sweet though i was absolutely petrified to go too near her just in case the baby kicked or something equally as startling i didntdo too well in awkward pregnancy situations i hated putting my hand on the stomach of a mother to be it was just too weird for me right so things were all right until that one question that mary asked so my nephew and yourself right i suppose she was trying to be discrete about it and offer me some kind of sly smile but i didntget what she meant the whole idea of james and myself was so foreign to me at least that i just couldntunderstand why and how his family was putting that together i guess it wasntthat much of a long shot but i just didntsee it that being the reason why i gaped at her for half a minute of silence before jude spoke up she means are you two together he spoke loudly and slowly as if he was talking to somebody who wasntall too smart and i shook my head blinking a few times oh oh oh no no i stopping shaking my head once more and smiling widely i started again no um james and me are just good friends actually mary eyebrows rose in obvious disbelief jenn expression was something along the lines of that as well mac looked surprised apparently he had thought so too jude scrunched his face up allowing his impending wrinkles to protrude and he offered me a rather apolegetic look just friends i oh mary cast a glance in the direction of the living room as if this would confirm the just friends label and then she allowed a small smile to take over her features well i was just going to tell you that he very lucky to have found a girl like you but either way i suppose just friends or not james is lucky you seem perfect for him if you dontmind me saying i opened my mouth to laugh an appreciated laugh but someone else laughter broke through before my own mrs potter had just walked into the room and she was laughing as if no one else could hear her as everyone turned in their chairs to face her she put a hand to her chest and cleared her throat oh i sorry was all she said before taking an armchair next to her husband lexi finally settled down she awfully i never heard the rest as i quietly excused myself declaring my need for a drink i had no intentions of returning of course with a hand to my forehead to ease the throbbing in it i made my way towards the kitchen and used my hip to open the door the door ended up hitting me hard in the back as i never really finished walking through the frame of it i couldnthave just denied any speculation that james and me were more than friends and then walk into the kitchen and see him like this i couldn t because it confused me and i didntknow how to handle situations that i was confused in i dontknow why on christmas eve with his face all clean shaven and smooth looking and his hair about as flat to his head as i ve ever seen it except for near the front that stuck out at rather odd angles i dontknow why he looked so good maybe it was the dim light of the kitchen and the carton of egg nog he had in his hand maybe it was the the shadows dancing over his features and giving him that impression of mystery that never truly left him maybe it was the fact i was so utterly weak and far too naive to see that just now hey i said breathlessly and only because the door hitting my back knocked the breath from me james turned from the counter where he was pouring glasses of egg nog and furrowed his brow at me he licked his lips as if tasting bitter words of resentment from earlier resting on them but he chose to say nothing of it hey egg nog he greeted simply suavely casually and in a way that was so james yes please i smiled at him and he narrowed his eyes in a hazy intent way a small smile brushing by his own lips you ll come hang out with us yeah we re just in the living room he asked while pouring a second glass of egg nog and handing me the first yeah i mean i looked at him as he wiped a drop of the milky liquid off of the side of the carton before returning it to the fridge yeah that d be sure i put my hair behind my ears and felt my cheeks flush as he turned around and gave me a rather confused raise of his eyebrows i want to ask you so bad what the hell is going on but i promise i ll leave it james took his glass from off of the counter and headed by me towards the door your mum i started as he went to push the door open pressing my lips hard together as he turned back around to look at me i knew it was the worst possible way to start a sentence when talking to him i knew it was nothing he d want to hear and i knew it might not get me anywhere to him it may mean nothing what was he supposed to do yell at his mum for not liking me what was he supposed to say i didntwant him choosing sides i didntexpect him to know what to say to me dani was his mum and i had no business trying to interfere with the mother son relationship that they had i had no business complaining to him about it no business relying on him to fix it make it better make this christmas incredible but he wanted to know what the hell was going on and his mum not liking me at all had everything to do with what the hell was going on this morning we i was talking to her i just told her i wanted to try to get along but she looked at me and she said you re not good enough for him you not good enough for you and honestly i not trying to be good enough for you i just your friend james and i didntthink there d be a day that i d have to apologize for that james sighed and rubbed his face with the hand that wasntholding his glass great he muttered itching his brow a pained i dontwant to have to deal with this expression hit his face what what am i supposed to do he slammed his way through the swinging door and i followed after him feeling guilty somehow james sat down in an armchair sirius was sprawled out on the sofa set off to the side of the room and remus was in an armchair as well all too aware of the three boys i sat down on the larger sofa and folded my hands in my lap crossing my ankles all elegant and lady like and i was neither sirius was going longneck up as remus offered me a cheeky grin and a hello i must say i liked that boy better on alcohol this is what you boys do for fun on the holidays james quirked his lips as he drank his egg nog and sirius took to answering my question nope he said loudly setting his empty bottle down on the floor this is what we do on the holidays when we have to respect the presence of a lady i scoffed raising an eyebrow at him as he folded his arms over his chest your parents let you guys drink i turned my attention to james as sirius spoke to remus yeah wild isntit we drink in my living room with my parents across the hallway i drinking egg nog for christ sake he drained his glass and then let a satisfied ahh out it just so damn good both of us looked at the television for a moment and then back at each other james was leaned over a bit with his elbow propped up on the arm of the chair and his head propped up in his hand his gaze was lazy but evasive his expression casual his eyes lidded but his jaw was rather clenched he looked strong but torn complete but indecisive he looked like a boy who would rather be anywhere but where he was but couldntimagine things any other way it was enough to make me burst at the seams with apologetic anthems to justify why i was the way i was and why i couldntbe any other way i felt so childish under his imposing stare and it was as if the position i was sitting in was crumbling until my posture would be hunched and the hands folded politely in my lap would be shaking and it was that kind of scrutiny from that kind of boy that kept me sane kept me stubborn kept me alive it was probably quarter after eleven when mac mary and jenn decided to head for home everybody was lazy and tired and grinning and felt the inevitable excitement over christmas morning despite everything as we were saying our goodbye s and exchanging brief hugs jenn gasped and went wide eyed grabbing onto my hand and pulling it to her stomach it never kicked before i eight months pregnant and it just properly kicking now oh my god she murmured excitedly looking to her mum hardly seeming to realize the state i was suddenly in oh my god i muttered in unison with her and glanced around the suddenly crowded entrance way to see james looking at us surprised james come here jenn beckoned to her cousin and grabbed his hand as well she held it for a moment considering where to put it and then placed it directly over my own it must be a foot it just kicking right there can you feel it james grinned widely yes mum come feel this the two of us removed our hands as mary came over to the beaming jenn and we stood in the doorway of the living room watching everybody else that was incredible i ve always had a bit of a fascination with that kicking babies it s pretty unbelievable he shrugged his broad shoulders and put his hands in his pockets looking to me i dontwant kids i blurted out suddenly overwhelmed for some reason james raised his eyebrows his grin still slightly in place and he shrugged again i do he said with a careful nod i want kids cantimagine life being fulfilled without any you know cantsay i do i muttered quietly shaking my head cantimagine life being fulfilled with any it was humbling hard realization how different we were there were so many obvious differences but then there were these insignificant facts that revealed themselves as time went on and sometimes they made things harder sometimes it was a big deal to get over the latest revelation about each other and just accept the fact this was how it was supposed to be we were different he could focus on the positive and i was slowly becoming a cynic he was afraid at times and though he was stubborn he could admit his fear for a situation whereas i was just wholly stubborn and refused to see things he had a gorgeous vocabulary and i always sounded like a rambling idiot when i used words like he did we balanced each other out though he needed to realized the negative and i needed to embrace the positive we whether we knew it then needed one another and that was something i could easily live with happy christmas lily the goodnight were drawing to an end as sirius and remus decided to head home about a minute after the other three left and there was sirius black wishing me an early happy christmas lacking any bottle of beer and any cheeky grin yes you too merry christmas i offered him a quick smile before going to say more but was swept into a rather suffocating hug by remus happy holidays lils i a jackass and am sorry for that i grinned and hit him in the shoulder when we pulled apart how was it that this boy was more perceptive when he was alcohol induced than when he was not merry christmas remus he smiled and turned to james james and remus went about exchanging well wishes and that somehow led to laughter and then there was nothing for me to do but turn back to sirius it just so happened that he and i were standing just beneath a spirg of mistletoe hanging from the ceiling in the hallway i noticed it of course being muggle born and fully understanding the consequences of being underneath mistletoe but sirius didtnotice for whatever reason and i wasntabout to point it out going up on my tiptoes i offered him the briefest hug possible and smiled at him once more see you later he nodded and looked down at his feet he would not offer me an apologie for what went on three days ago he did not have to it was not expected of him i hated how he was trying to act like nothing was wrong like he had not come off like some kind of jealous idiot and like he had not ruined any possibility of him and me i hated how he was too scared and too proud to tell me he was out of line and that he was sorry i hated how this was sirius and this was what i d have to deal with if i could honestly stop think and realize i still wanted something with him none of which at the moment i could do 11 45 and things had quieted down to the point where i thought i may go crazy there was just some warm silence amongst the potter as they lounged in the living room that i did not belong in it was as if i was a quiet observer of the model family and i would never be able to obtain something so good as disappointing as it was to think this it was also strangely comforting to know this type of family exisisted the type who had people in it who were flawed beyond repair but when they were together they were absolutely brilliant and nothing could break that by midnight jude and mrs potter said goodnight turned the lights on the christmas tree off and went to bed feeling mrs potter lingering eye as she left the room prompted me to tell james i was off to bed as well i yawned as i stepped into my bedroom and turned the light on i still had to wrap all of the gifts i had bought and being the rather traditional girl i was i planned on doing it by hand rather than just waving my wand a few times but after i straightened the room up got my pajamas out and realized it was just passed midnight waving my wand seemed a lot easier in five minutes all of the gifts were wrapped and i was just finishing up writing the to and from out on the tags when i took a glance out of the bedroom window that overlooked the front yard and the street below it was a clear night and the glass of the window somehow seemed clearer too a shiver running down my spine and a small smile on my lips i turned back to the gifts and decided to take them downstairs and put them under the tree i climbed onto the bed going to pull the blind down before going downstairs and saw somebody standing right in the middle of the street shaking my head and quirking an eyebrow i grabbed onto the end of the blind and tugged it down until i realized that somebody standing in the middle of the street was james squinting i moved closer to the window until my breath was fogging it up it had to be him hands in his pockets head inclined upwards and moonlight reflecting in his glasses i threw my long huge buttoned chocolate brown winter coat on and gathered all of the presents into my arms with difficulty due to the amount that i was carrying i arrived in the living room spread the gifts out under the tree and then found myself opening the front door quietly and going out into the night i drew my coat closer while walking down the driveway to the curb focusing on the quite still james it was a light night the large moon providing much of the light the dark sky had a bit of a navy blue glow to it and only the brightest stars could be really seen it was quiet on this street only a couple of street lights were on and there were no lights on in any of the houses it was peaceful and hard to believe there was a world outside of this i understood now why he was standing in the middle of the street so effortlessly everything was dead but in this delicate mesmeric way everything wasntso much dead as it was tired it was as if the world held it breath and was covered in a frosty sleep that we were free to enjoy there was the slightest breeze however that kept the night lulled in it sleep but made me feel so alive i was suddenly aware of everything from the sound of my breathing to the length of my eyelashes to the distance at which james was standing i had gone from on the edge of sleep to on the edge of some exhilirated drive into the night the breeze blew over the apples of my cheeks and i felt them flush it was a rather beautiful feeling the gravel and snow on the drive crunched beneath my feet and i watched them closely in love with the simple sound james gaze was slowly brought towards me and i let out a whoosh of breath always mesmerized by the way it contrasted against the night hey his tone was quiet but seemed to echo throughout the seemingly empty night and it was certainly appreciative do you ever sleep anymore i asked with a slight smile on my face once upon a time he was the boy who went to sleep as soon as classes were over woke to eat a meal and then was sleeping again honestly his eyes were sharp and aware but so deliciously hazel no i i really don t his gaze was back at the sky his hand was then in his hair and then he was looking at me again i ve not got much reason to anymore i used to sleep a lot because i was bored i guess bored and easily exhausted but it kinda changed he pressed his lips together and nodded slowly you kinda made me love staying up as late as possible and you kinda made me appreciate the circles underneath my eyes and that why i so sorry that this isntat all like we expected it to be i stood with rather wide eyes and slightly parted lips the air was so fresh and cool and clear that it almost hurt to breathe so well and smoothly my arms became rigid and i did not know what to say nothing was like we had expected it to be the holidays weren t he wasn t and our friendship wasnt like we expected it to be you know slowly and my head turning this way and that to be sure there were no cars coming i joined him on the pavement that was glimmering with frost there absolutely nothing we can do about it now with his jaw rather clenched and his stare rather piercing he looked down at me i sorry she doesntthink you re good enough i nodded and looked down at the pavement then up at the sky and silence greeted us like old friends there was finally nothing left to say abc chapter 15 behind the madness danielle potter was a proud woman i remember thinking that soon after meeting her you could see it in her eyes her posture her lack of wrinkles she was proud she had every right to be and i understood that danielle potter was married at the age of eighteen fresh out of hogwarts where both of james parents attended james wasntborn until she was thirty four and he was meant to be their only child for he was a son and when families of prosperity had a son it was all they needed all of a sudden it seemed she turned forty seven and her whole world came crashing down in some type of storm that nobody expected to befall the potter s midlife crisis met both herself and her husband head on and a divorce was likely to follow it was never spoken but it was likely work was all jude potter lived for and danielle potter lived for blocking the magical world from her perfectly shaped life that was a problem for jude the realist working so high up in the ministry meant he knew of all the problems the magical world was facing and he usually had to deal with all of those problems himself as potentially fatal as they may be and then she was forty seven three months pregnant and almost completely detached from her husband it changed then i guess when she got pregnant with lexi jude and her made things work and somehow were more in love than before but she became protective a bit she was an idealist living in a world full of jaded cynics and could control little that happened in life her children though they were her pride and joy as difficult as it must ve been to get pregnant again unexpectedly at an older age she wanted that baby girl more than anything in the world she put all of her faith and hope into the birth of lexi swearing that having a baby around the house would help her and jude and they d get back to where they were and her son would start respecting her and talking to her again and it worked it seemed she was happy again jude and her back to where they were and james stopped being a little brat danielle potter didnthave the life she planned on having and it wasntalways as great as she thought it would be but she had very little to complain about she had children and one thing she could do was make sure they had the best of everything make sure nothing in their life went wrong and make sure she approved of everything her husband was quiet at times after their reconciliation letting her be protective and controlling he didntfight her on anything anymore and bless him for it her children grew familiar with the thought of their mum making the decisions in their life and being quite particular over who they were friends with and that what it was that where my whole role in this began i wasnta childhood friend i wasntat an age of innocence where mrs potter could blindly win me over i had forced my way into james life sometime during the months where mrs potter was not there to watch over him and he had let me he had let me in and brought me home for the holidays and danielle potter couldnttake that she couldnttake the fact that james didntcare whether or not she liked me james liked me and she didntmatter in our friendship james had grown up and mrs potter had somehow missed it and that why i wasntgood enough i had walked in on already shaky grounds and i swear she didntmean it even if it hurt a bit she didntmean it she was just covering up for being weaker than she was meant to be mrs potter and i had something in common afterall but none of that seemed to matter right now for we were standing in the middle of the street on christmas eve james and me cavanaugh park by something corporate we had stood there for five minutes enduring a frosty silence and just gazing at the sky with expectant wide eyes hopeful for snow even though i was eighteen i had not yet accepeted that christmas morning would come with or without a thick blanket of snow to cover the ground sometime during those five minutes james had lowered himself down onto the pavement bent his legs up and draped his arms over his knees i could hear him breathing from where i stood and it was slow and heavy a gorgeous disturbation of the silent night is this good for you he asked suddenly a hand at the back of his neck rubbing it nervously and his eyes downcast what the holidays i turned to look at him and tucked my hands into my coat pockets no not necessarily it understandable that they re not good for you i just mean being somewhere for the holidays having someone for the holidays you know it occured to me then i think realizing that i was somewhere other than a cold dark castle on the holidays i was with someone who cared about me even if it wasntmy own family my own family wasntlike he was he was incredible and warm and wanted me around for the holidays it was like there was the strangest feeling going through me as i looked down at him sitting there on the pavement like some little boy all curled up in anticipation of that christmas morning he ll not have enough sleep for it was hard to describe and hard to put a grasp on hard to understand the fact that james potter could offer me these types of feelings this sense of security filled with cold hard emotions but all with so much care how did it feel what was it like was it good for me good for me so much more so much everything i needed it it was it was what was it what did this feel like and then it hit me um you know i ve never really known what home feels like i always thought i was better off not knowing because it wouldnthurt as much to realize that i didnthave it but mmm i was i was proved wrong i guess not knowing what home feels like and then then experiencing it finding it feeling warm and safe and loved and comfortable and wanted it was devastating to realize what home felt like and know that i d never had it before never really had home god it was devastating for about a second until it hit me how it incredible it was incredible it was like coming home feeling all of that james i cleared my throat as i had rambled on incessantly and james had stood up rather quickly alarmed by the state i had fallen into my hands moved as i spoke and he watched me intently as if i may collaspe from lack of breathing if i was to collaspe from anything during these holidays it would be from the overwhelming existence that was james potter what lily his voice was even and deep holding a slightly cautious tone as he took a step towards me you are when i around you during these past couple of days it was like coming home being with you is like home to me i does that make sense it a bit new to me it a bit hard to say that i know not actually knowing what coming home felt like but i do now i do know it s it you you know it how you make me feel it just something that that hit me hard it hit me so hard to know th that you you are so mu quite suddenly he was very there in front of me and swallowing hard with a bobbing adam apple and breathing slowly and deeply enough to calm me as well he d pick up the pieces if i needed him to he d be there if i needed him to he didntsay either of those things and was so silent but that silence had been screaming at me for days on behalf of the messy haired potter he was offering me something anything it was mine for the taking he was mine for the taking he was strong and he wanted me to believe it you dontknow how overwhelming you are he whispered to me a blast of warm breath meeting my frozen cheeks and it was surprising to me when i realized it was his warm breath i dontknow whether to be sorry you ve never known what being home feels like or or happy that i can offer you something finally a part of me wanted to turn away and mutter some apology for being so weak and being on the brink of a break down another part of me wanted to break down just to see if either of us could handle and a final part of me wanted to be stubborn and strong and hold my head high because i was never a girl that needed someone i never needed saving or a hero or even a role model in my life i had made it this far almost completely on my own and i wasntsure how a girl like me could offer all of her insecurities to the world and stand there helplessly with her hands at her sides and a pained expression on her face and let somebody else do the fixing up i didntknow how to be appreciative or sincere or anything but a mess an absolute mess there were times when i wanted a hero but didntknow how to go about that how did somebody who was so rigid go about finding herself a hero did hero just fall from the sky what level of insanity did you have to be at before you got yourself a hero was there any hope left for me every night since i saw my sister last i had thought about how much it was my fault that my parents were only vaugely aware of my exisistence i berated myself and just wanted to to break you know just wanted to find something some proof some light some familiarity some home and then there he was i wontmake you by something corporate i pressed my lips hard together as things between us grew quiet but every other sound that belonged to the night seemed to magnify it was as if the midnight traffic moved closer and you could almost hear the cars whirring by the slighest breeze picked up and stung my eyes dry from having not blinked in over a minute i could hear my slightly erratic breathing far too louldy and parted my lips to try to gain normality with it my lips grew dry as i took steady sips of the night air through them and when my tongue darted out to sooth them james eyes dashed down to watch this and then they rested on my nose his own seemed to twitch as he looked at mine and then he was staring into my eyes again there was a step left between us that i didntreally expect him to take yet when he did it seemed as if it was where he should ve been standing all along this night was that of what was found in poetry i was living in a bloody poem on christmas eve this boy and this girl standing in the middle of an empty midnight street surrounded by familiar scents of christmases passed and it could ve been incredible had i let it be he took that step with his shoulders as broad as they could be and at his fullest height and placed his hands gently on my upper arms with the slighest exhalation of breath that could ve been a sigh that stare that he had so bravely held was broken and he seemed to rather concentrate on what he was doing with his hands his grip tightened slightly and he pulled me closer my head would ve come to rest against his chest had i been a bit more flexible and realized just what this was what re you doing i tried to breathe in some croaky fashion but the words died in my throat just as he pulled me swiftly against him and my arms seemed to act on instinct wrapping high around his back his hands slid away from my arms and one tangled itself in the ends of my hair while the other tickled the back of my ungloved hand in some sweet sense that was utterly lost on me it was probably fifteen seconds no it was fifteen seconds fifteen seconds that just absolutely flew by and i hardly realized what has happened in those fifteen seconds but there was something about those fifteen seconds that felt like the beginning of a lifetime james looked positively serious as we pulled apart the pun my own thoughts had brought on didntreally occur to me i couldntimagine honestly anybody but james right now the actual sirius was a world away it felt like it had been some accurately coloured dream and this here with james now was real was all that was real was all i really knew and god damn it i was so wide eyed and naive when it came to to him my thoughts were always a bit irrational a bit all over the place and crazy mixed up and dramatic but at the center of every one of my thoughts was some raw distinct burning truth some hard realization or some sudden awe i could sit and think long and hard about something and get no where and the next second i could be making decisions and judgements with hardly a second doubt somewhere along the way i think something damaged me a bit something hurt me beyond my own realization and control and i started becoming who i was i turned into this girl this this girl with her head in the clouds but this girl who would never dare to think outside of the box i wasntoften taken care of when i was a child i just grew up being independent and that what was so unbelievably hard with sharing my life with someone else with letting people in self proclaimed i was a bitter jaded lonely girl in the eyes of another i was innocent rough around the edges and somehow beauty radiated through that and to james potter i d never fully understand we werentperfect nothing we d come to have was perfect even when i d like to think it was our pasts were foggy sometimes dark our thoughts were blurry i spoke too fast and him too quiet he offered me the world when i just wanted one sole thing i wanted the world when he offered me himself he wanted freedom when i wanted to cling he wanted me to cling when i wanted to run we contrasted one another in this way that could ve been devastating in a way that could have been damaging and hateful but just worked for us he just worked for me it just happened you know him and me we happened in a dark time i found myself in years of twisted dark hate it just seemed everything in my life was a contradiction like hugging james potter right then it was just a hug this delicate rather awkward embrace that lasted all of fifteen seconds and it meant nothing but at the same time it meant the world as we pulled away and took our respective steps back i tilted my head a bit and tried to stare up into his eyes all i could really make out through the relative dark was my own reflection and that of the large moon in his glasses it was fitting that i couldntsee into his eyes after something like that you know because he may be showing signs of of something other than strength and integrity he may be the lesser half of this friendship for once the whole night sighed collectively and i was finally smiling at him i hated who he was at times but only because i envied who he was i wanted who he was that strength and integrity that ability to make your world shake with realization and warmth his height his posture his lean casual frame there was a change in him eventually not so much a change as a breakthrough realizing and accepting he wasntable to hold everybody up forever realizing he had the right to let the truth crash down and hurt people who he didntwant to see hurt he didntneed to be everybody rock he didntneed to be perfect and god he sure as hell exercised his rights to be flawed as shocking as it was for him to become so brutal and stubborn minded it also suited him the change in him may have threw me off a bit when it first came but then it just made sense it was what i expected and it made me want to fight him everytime we spoke it may me stronger in a way but on this bloody christmas eve it just seemed so far off it seemed as if that soft spoken nice guy was all he was i guess he just decided to prove us wrong you going to stay the way you are james i asked quietly as we made our way off of the street back to the driveway mmm i doubt it only til we can handle more he responded with a quirk of his lips putting his hands into the pockets of his jeans and he had answered he had responded easily and simply and honestly only until we could handle more i knew that neither of us thought that would ever be the case christmas morning happened i supposed before anybody really accepted that it would it just came so quickly that as prepared as everybody seemed it was a surprise but it was just as christmas morning was meant to be with a fresh blanket of snow that fell during the night and pale sunlight greeting us a couple of hours after we greeted the morning and as edgy and awkward as everybody had been in the days leading up to christmas it was all sure to be gone because christmas has this magical aspect to it whether you re in the wizardry world or not that can affect you even in the summer months there always this secret yearning for the warm homey feeling of christmas and i highly doubted that mrs potter would let that be ruined just because she didntsee eye to eye with me it was 6 30 and rather dark out when i was woke that morning i put a cashmere sweater on over my holiday themed pajamas brushed my teeth and was greeted by the youngest bouncing potter in the hallway outside of my bedroom lexi curls were rather messed and she looked as if she could fall over asleep at any second but she wore a grin and her eyes were absolutely bright and blue i didntreally see the family resemblance between lexi and james until that morning and when danielle got pregnant so late in life and then had a baby that didntlook much like her husband questions arose more of the mid life drama i d come to know later this beautiful blue eyed blonde haired baby girl that only really looked like dani for the first few years dani had lighter hair when she was younger that where the blonde came from but nobody considered that all that really mattered was the fact danielle and jude potter change of life baby may not be so much jude as he seemed to think it put a strain on things and they still worked through it all of their passion and love and flare for life was in their eyes james were this smoldering hazel colour and lexi almost the complete opposite gorgeously blue but both sets of eyes were alive and beautiful and narrowed when they considered things both had perfect sets of lashes lexi were long and curled out james were dark and thick the potter in them both resided in their eyes is everybody up i asked lexi quietly while a completely foreign yet oddly familiar feeling fluttered into my stomach she nodded mummy just woke james up and told me to come see if you were up happy christmas lily she took off down the hall giggling madly the pretty little nightgown she was wearing almost tripping her as she ran then i realized just what that fluttering feeling was christmas i didntrecall being excited for christmas since i was nine or ten but this just felt so real and right there was a sense of warm drowsiness hanging in the atmosphere but some spark of anticipation woke us all up and beckoned us to the living room where a fire was already crackling merrily in the hearth merry christmas lily james and i met up on the second set of stairs going down his parents and lexi floor he was just coming from his parents bedroom jude had descended the stairs just before him and as he wished me a merry christmas i was suddenly aware of the fact that i hadntbrushed my hair when i woke up my hands flew to tame my hair as i stood on the stair below the one james was on he of course looked handsome with absolutely no effort on any given morning so why should christmas morning be any different his hair was a bit flyaway which brought back memories of just won qudditch matches for some reason but he held that casually sophisticated look what with his thin framed glasses green navy plaid pajama pants and grey sweatshirt i couldnthelp but feel a bit inferior to him just then he was tall anyway but being a stair above me just made him that much taller and for some reason him being just that much taller made me feel small and a bit insignificant usually i loved his height and how protective it made him seem but not this morning while i was stood in my bloody candy cane pajamas i felt like a child deep down i knew it was my own fault i felt like a child and at times seemed like a child it was on my own accord that i was standing before him on christmas morning in candy cane pajamas it was me who assumed everybody was talking to me as if i couldnthandle hearing the truth i was perhaps subconciously trying to feel like a child because then i would be safe and protected and not have to worry about anything it was my first christmas morning away from hogwarts for a few years and just maybe i wanted to remember feeling so loved just maybe it wasntsuch a bad thing to come off absolutely childish being so unbelievably absorbed in my thoughts i turned away from james without even responding to him it usually just a reflex to wish a merry christmas in return but there was something awfully striking about this morning and i didntquite realize the severity of furrowing one brow and turning swiftly away from a merry christmas on christmas morning lily c mon wait james had the furrow in his brow this time as he quickly went down the stairs behind me grabbing onto the crook of my elbow and holding me back listen to me i turned around and tilted my head up at him chewing my bottom lip and not understanding how i could turn pages so quickly james had said that once that i turned pages faster than he could keep up with it was the truth this must be hell for you and i could stand here and apologize all morning for everything that has gone wrong is going to go wrong and could go wrong sometime in the near future but i d much rather stand here and promise you a merry christmas despite it all and ask you to believe me he wrapped his long warm and calloused fingers around my wrists in a rather tight grip but in one that made me come crashing back to reality yes i m i pulled my hands away from him and put them to my face taking a deep breath i sorry i just you re shaking he interrupted me pulling me close to him and stroking his fingers up and down my right forearm i know but it feels nice i murmured nearly resting my head against his chest but stopping an inch short of it it just a mixture of being relatively cold and and christmas morning this is how christmas morning would always feel i d just shake at random intervals and it d be some sort of appreciated relief all right lily james smiled warmly and gave my hand a squeeze before leading the way into the living room everyone wished each other a merry christmas as lexi sat on the floor near the tree hardly containing her excitement would you like some tea lily mrs potter asked sweetly as me and james situated ourselves on the couch i what yes i mean please yes please as i stumbled over my accepting of her offer james rubbed the bridge of his nose and mr potter chuckled to himself i had a strange feeling that had spoke to his wife this morning as james had spoke to me mrs potter excused herself to the kitchen and lexi started making impatient sighs i smiled happy holidays lexi jude and dani i received five gifts from the three pottes and that how each tag was signed in large loopy handwriting mrs potter s my favourite was an absolutely gorgeous emerald green sweater that was so unbelievably soft mrs potter said she had picked it out and it was charmed to feel so soft it matched my eyes she told me there was also a silver charm bracelet lexi picked it out and had one like it she told me a box of assorted flavoured tea a large candle that smelled like egg nog i swear and finally a book and then it was gone or at least that hour and some minutes of opening presents was gone christmas morning was near gone it was rushed and warm and lovely and confusing and gone it had taken so long for it to come and it had been such a stubborn thing in everybody minds for the past few weeks and all we had to show for it was torn wrapping paper and bows laying about on the floor where we sat opening the gifts my things were sat in a neat pile on the couch and i was wondering if i had stopped smiling since i sat down there the gifts mr mrs potter gave to their children were ridiculously extravagant their other relatives had given them money mainly james lexi had given mrs potter some expensive looking necklace and matching earrings and their father an interesting looking gadget that made no sense to me but the things that mr mrs potter had given to james lexi were so abundant for lack of a better word there was so much and it was all wrapped so neat and you could just tell that each gift was considered greatly and meant only for the child it was given to i appreciated my gifts greatly but i was sure i couldnthide my disbelief as present after present was placed before james or lexi all in all christmas morning was like i remembered christmas morning to be and it was nice to know i hadntlost myself when it came time for the potter to open my gifts i was so embarrassed and flustered and couldntremember for a moment just what i had bought this distinguished family lexi though was so enchanted by her barbie and when she opened the toy kitten i had given her she suddenly decided it needed a real one to be friends with i had got mr potter a book on cars and a box of cigars and he seemed to like it but honestly all i really cared about was whether mrs potter liked her gifts or at least would pretend to and she seemed to i guess she positively beamed when she opened them and said she loved teapots and i felt rather accomplished save for the fact that james i had come to some silent decision to exchange gifts when we were on our own and i was a bit nervous about facing him again that morning i did not want to break down it was nearly eight o clock when everything had been cleaned up magically and admired and the potter put their piles of gifts beneath the tree again leaving them on display i carried mine up to my room deciding to change from my pajamas and get a shower breakfast would be at 9 o clock and mrs potter seemed to be expecting melly her family to be over for the meal i took my time in the warm shower and dried my hair a bit so it would curl nicely i wore the sweater the potter gave me for christmas and a knee length black skirt with a satiny sash around the waist that almost matched the colour of the sweater with a sigh i brushed some mascara onto my eyelashes and smoothed some lipgloss on honestly i wasnttoo concerned with prettying myself up this early in the morning it felt a bit awkward really to be wearing something other than pajamas on christmas morning but this whole experience felt a bit awkward and i wasntabout to deny the holidays that i picked james gifts up this was about the third time i had put them under the tree and then brought them back upstairs with me and left the room feeling a nervous shudder trail down my spine the sun was finally starting to brighten things up a bit though there was some grey haze to the sky that kept everything surreal feeling i trailed my fingertips down the banister while going down the stairs liking the subtle warmth that was coming through the window in the form of sunlight and resting on the banister in some faded orange glow the large house was rather chilly this morning or at least it was on this floor the slight chill kept me awake and aware though something that had been delved deep inside of me seemed to stumble forth and i came to a stop on the second floor not going down the next set of stairs just letting this realization spread of where i was stood and why i was there and who i was involved with why haventyou run yet lily i asked myself shaking my head and trying to get the feeling of this this uncertainty to shake away as well it was about 9 o clock when i came downstairs and placed james presents on the couch and just as he appeared in the doorway of the living room there was a knock at the door he gave me a smile and i followed him to the front door as he pulled it open it was a gorgeous looking melly her parents and somebody near the bottom of the stairs that i couldntrecognize as he was well bundled up but i assumed it was a member of melly family happy christmas come in come in james beckoned the lewis family inside and offered to take their coats you look lovely this morning sherry melly mum was a pretty woman and obviously not as old at james parents nor as young as my own her father charles was a handsome distinguished man and seemed rather the strong silent type i ll get the door i said smiling at melly who positively beamed back at me there was something off putting yet at the same time nice about her the man who had been standing at the bottom of the stairs had approached the top step and just he just stood there for a moment me holding the door open looking off in another direction and not realizing he hadntcome in until the sharp morning air met me are you going to i began turning to look at the man who had a hat on and large winter jacket he wasnta tall or large man he was rather small framed but could come off forceful if he needed to his hair was sandy coloured and his eyes were a hazel green though the green protruded more he had a rather dark complexion and a rather chiseled chin lines rested near his eyes though he still held the youth that i so well remembered about him he was ethan evans my father melly james and mr mrs lewis had gone into the kitchen by now and i was just stood staring at this familiar face though it seemed it had been gone from my memory for decades what re you doing here i hissed at him in a quick whisper pushing the door shut until there was only enough space for me to stand between blocking his way in i didntthink it was a crime to want to see your daughter at christmas time i was in disbelief disbelief didnteven begin to describe it but it was all i knew to think disbelief but what right did i have to be in any sort of disbelief to be in any sort of shock over the fact my father was standing on the doorstep of james house on christmas morning i had no right i had no right to be angry over this but i was my cheeks were absolutely burning as were my eyes because i hadntblinked since i realized it was him my bare legs were getting rather numb and cold due to the open door and bitter morning but apparently a part of me refused to just let him in it wasntthat much of a surprise i guess i had left the potter address with petunia in case of an emergency and i should ve known she would ve told either mum or dad that i was at a boys house a freak of a boy none the less you wouldntbe here if you didntknow i was at a boys house i murmured blinking my watering eyes excessively for a moment before focusing them back on my father he sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his large ungloved hands that were discoloured because of the cold could you let me in please sweetheart i began to shake my head just as james entered the hallway again asking me why i was still standing at the door as if i had been burned by one of them i stepped back from the door quickly and stared at james as he saw the man at the door and looked curiously towards me this is um this is my my father ethan dad this is james was suddenly right next to me and resting a warm hand upon my shoulder giving it a squeeze and then removing it this is james ah so this is the boy dad stepped inside and tugged his hat off and put it in his pocket rubbing his hands together to warm them nice to meet you he offered his hand to james and he shook it offering a nod i ll be right back i gave him a pleading look but he ignored me easily and left the hallway with a hard stare at my father nice to meet you that not true you dontcare what re you doing here dad i tried to stay calm but that shaken state i had been earlier that morning was quickly returning and the tremors were much worse dad swallowed and nodded shrugging his shoulders and rubbing his arm petunia told me last night that you had been around and i was surprised she told me the address that you were staying at and just happened to mention you were at some random boys house lily dear you re seventeen for god sake you shouldntbe spending christmas eighteen i eighteen years old dad i shook my head and put a hand to my forehead smoothing my hair back he looked sympathetic for a moment but then was back to playing the protective father whatever the case you shouldnt be here rebecca and myself are leaving for our trip tomorrow and i think we think that you should come with us this year since you re already home i not home i at james for christmas and you re not dragging me away on some cruise with you and your broad just because you ve not been paying enough attention to me to know what going on in my life i refused to become any sort of hysterical but this man showing up on james doorstep they had a nice doorstep at that and declared he was going to drag me off with his girlfriend on their cruise for the first time in the 4 years they had been taking them was just absolutely absurd it wasntany fair to me i decided that long ago lily his voice was lowered dangerously but my nose just flared at this and i attempted to stand taller i dontknow this boy petunia doesntknow this boy your mother most likely doesntknow this boy and i dontthink it appropriate nor flattering for you to be spending the holidays with him and imposing he took a step closer to me outstretching his palms and looking as if he was going to try to hug me or sooth me or something but i really didntwant it my dad was always a rational good man always he and mum divorced but neither of them were having any extra marital affairs and he was a good sport about losing a lot of what he worked for to her he was an honest man and worked hard he was fun loving and loved to travel and just get caught up in life but just because he was all of those things to every other person in his life doesntmean he was that way to me he treated me like a child always it must ve had something to do with the fact i left home for hogwarts at such a young age and he only ever really saw me during the summers not long enough to realize i had grown up any and deserved to be treated like i had to my father it seemed i was still some ten year old girl with braids in her hair and an innocent smile upon her face i still needed protection and shelter from the world even though i had long since grown accustom to taking care of myself he just didntsee it and that was always part of the problem another part of the problem lily james told me at some point is you just who you are and how you are stubborn and resilient and hell bent on convincing yourself you re alone i was going to say something i had to say something and would be a bit of a coward if i didntsay something but i just stared at my dad wondering who the hell this man was and why he seemed so ashamed of me why he seemed to think i should be ashamed to be here when the words didntcome right away my father went to step through the doorway but i shook my head and tried to tell him to leave just as my father hand met the door roughly and pushed it back lexi emerged from the kitchen evaluated the situation and then bloody well screamed mummy lily fighting with a man a second later mrs potter burst through the kitchen door and stood staring at me struggling to shut the door on my father what are you doing shut that door it frigid out there melly and mr mrs lewis were the next to come through the swinging kitchen door and they looked at me with raised eyebrows what going on melly asked loudly over lexi shrill whines and mrs potter trying to calm her whilst berate me oh for heaven sake melly mother commented turning to her husband who loudly responded to her who are these people lily my dad shouted over the commotion and i just stepped away from the door while he pushed it open wider and i looked around helplessly at the sudden mess these people seemed to be in lexi i heard mrs potter shriek as she ran towards my father and frowned up at him opening her mouth to say something that only resulted in a high pitched wail as melly picked her up and moved her away melly parents began flying off the handle at her for interferring and i put my hands over my ears disbelieving this few of people could be so loud and awkward in a situation like this then the kitchen door swung open a final time and james came through with jude right behind him i tilted my head and offered a pleading look and jude nodded curtly as james tried to get to me my father was trying to get my attention over the noise and mrs potter was shouting something in the general direction of where i was standing but i couldntpay attention that enough jude boomed clapping his hands together loudly once and gaining everyone stares i shut the door as my father stepped inside and i leaned against it resting my forehead against it i sorry i sorry i murmured tapping my forehead against the door repeatedly trying to fight fire with fire and ease the pounding in my head by pounding my head sherry charles if you could excuse us for a moment i apologize jude said and they nodded understandingly going back to the kitchen as melly led lexi in too jude i told you mrs potter began but jude shook his head gruffly frowning in thought at his wife actually darling if you could excuse us as well mrs potter eyebrows raised in unpleasant surprise and she went back into the kitchen without so much a glance at jude jude sighed and rubbed his temples turning to look at my father mr evans i assume dad nodded at jude very business like way and they shook hands ethan dad said as jude went over to the doorway of the living room i jude potter and perhaps we should step into my study it was in the form of a question but it wasntactually a question more like a bit of a firm request it surprised me but in a bit of a satisfied way to see my father follow after jude so easily and without a question jude was often superior and there was just something that seemed to radiate around him there came a time shortly after these holidays when that bald headed man was the only father figure i had in my life i forgot for a moment that james was still standing in the hallway with me as i was still leaning against the door and breathing deeply what the hell was that lily he asked quietly his voice low and his proximity close i was struggling to keep my voice steady and stop my body from shaking again what was that that wasntmy fault that what it was it wasntmy fault i turned away from the door and reached for james he obliged letting me stand close against him but not actually wrapping his arms around me or touching me anywhere my head was pounding and i tried to recall the number of things dani had thrown my way admist the confusion and loud voices i swore she had said just before jude interrupted that she wanted me out of her house though i should ve felt abandoned and i should ve felt rather hated i didn t i felt just so drained and standing on the edge of insanity this christmas was full of lies this christmas was a bloody lie it was a lie this morning as good as it started off was a lie i should ve known better than to think it d last that mrs potter would stay pleasant and sweet apparently like she always is are you going to go with him james muttered after a minute of just holding his breath with me silence was all i really wanted just then no i shook my head and it brushed against his chest no god james everybody just overreacted it who they are he sighed and took a step back from me staring down at me and trying to see my face you re not crying are you james asked tentatively brushing his hands over my face to be sure when i shook my head no i sorry i told him moving away from him and sitting down on the first stair leading upstairs he just crossed his arms and leaned against the wall by the staircase waiting it seemed i leaned back against the stair above the one i was sitting on and watched him through half closed eyes i wondered if he hated me for what i did for who i was and how i was how when my world got turned upside down lately his did too because of me because i was here the middle by jimmy eat world he had his hazel eyes closed and his arms folded over his chest taking slow deep breaths james was obviously still tired a few times he yawned silently covered his mouth with his hand and then folded his arms again there were circles beneath his eyes but they were circles he was beginning to wear proudly what with the lack of sleep he was getting lately he had changed into a pair of dark rinsed jeans and a white button down with navy stripes running vertically over it the cuffs were unbuttoned and he could have buttoned a few more up near the neck but i wasntone to complain over his casual look and his almost revealed chest his hair was an absolute mess this morning but it was just starting to grow out some from his neat shorter haircut that he had when he first came back from the summer and when it was more shaggy it just added to his undeniable good looks made him seem a little darker a little tough ten minutes had passed since jude escorted my father into his study and james and me hadnttalked since i sat down on the stairs i thought maybe he had fell asleep leaning against the wall but when he said my name i quickly looked to him lily he muttered again through a bit of a sigh yeah james i sat up straighter and waited for it waited he looked serious as he pulled his eyes open and i couldnthelp but wonder i didnt want to know what he was thinking not this time i just maybe you maybe you should go home with your dad oh my god i love you guys so much and am sorry this took like over a month i just really hope you guys like it because the one thing i can promise you is that i worked hard on it so in order for this story to stay up on this website i had to remove the songs from the chapters though in my original i have the songs in it i posting the songs in my livejournal and i posting my replies to your reviews from last chapter in my livejournal as well so if songs or replies are important to you check out my livejournal the link in my profile kaitlyn chapter 16 pride abc nothing like you and i by the perishers abc december 29th pride it was a damaging cruel blinding thing it was something that each person needed a sense of pride a sense of self assurance at the very essence of all of us there is some blazing pride that some people absolutely thrive on sirius black was proud nobody really knew why because he was obviously ashamed of his family and his past but he was still one of the only people i knew who could be so proud and carry himself so well he was of course a bit cocky from time to time a bit arrogant a bit know it all but his pride was something different from those things his pride was the one thing you could relate him to it the one thing that stood out about him it completed him it absolutely made him who he was he was such a hard person to forget it was impossible to forget him you could go without him for long periods of time and still have the picture perfect vision of him in your mind that was because he came in such large doses he was so much at one time so overwhelming and so dizzying that if you didntspeak to him for weeks then started to again it would be as if you never stopped being around being with sirius was like you have been there for him your whole life he made everything so easy and casual despite the fact he truly was a heavy dark person who would become almost as bitter as remus sirius dark hair grey seemingly impenetrable eyes and easy demeanor matched him and with his looks suiting who he was just fine it seemed as if that pride of his just radiated about him but in a very subtle respectful way he held his head a bit higher than everybody else and the weight on his shoulders was not as heavy as anybody else s his ways were simple though the intense simplicity of them came across rather complex he believed lying was alright as long as it wasnta matter of life and death he believed rules were meant to be broken he believed in heaven but not hell he believed in life after death he believed in love he believed that women were the most intricate things put on the earth and that the only reason they were there were to be loved and respected but the single utmost important thing that sirius black believed in was something he taught me to believe in too himself abc it was impossible not to believe in him it was impossible not to believe every word that came out of his mouth even when he was lying and you just knew he was you wanted to believe him because the world of lies he had been creating his whole life was a beautiful flawless world a beautiful flawless world that he thought very few deserved to live in if he told you everything was going to be all right then believe me everything was going to be all right sirius held your best interests are heart he wanted you to believe things were a certain way because he hated to see anymore people become jaded cynical and bitter he was positively afraid everyone would be like that some day and while a few jaded cynics balances the population out a bit sirius was rather determined to keep everyone around him sane how did he do that driving them insane i suppose with his his absolute mind blowing questions his statements that turned you upside down and his smile that was what he thought to be the only genuine thing about a person pride being the damaging cruel blinding thing that it was it made apologies hard it made apologies insincere and impersonal i doubted sirius had ever said the word sorry and wanted to say it i doubted he had ever said it on his own will and sincerely meant it with everything he was so when december 29th came about and i was seeing sirius black for the first time in about five days i wasntexpecting that apology in the most sincere form it could come in him with hunched shoulders and a slight frown murmuring his apology not once but it was about 10 o clock in the morning i was still very much at the potter s and i realized that it appeared to be awhile since sirius had shaved his face was covered in a dark stubble though it wasntnear thick enough to be considered a beard he wore a pair of dark blue jeans a blue striped white button down beneath a half zipped navy sweater he had swept his dark lockes away from his eyes and had a rather set expression on his face the potter and whatever company was over this morning were in the kitchen finishing off a late breakfast sirius and remus hadntbeen over since christmas eve and here he was i was in a pair of pajama pants and a sweatshirt when he stumbled upon me coming down the stairs with folded arms to keep me warm his eyes seemed to dance for a moment as they followed me down the stairs and over to where he stood you know what happened a few days ago me acting like some kind of arsehole over what remus told me sirius began abruptly looking to the floor but then staring determinedly at me yes i replied after a moment rather taken aback and sounding so i sorry quiet at first a sigh following and then louder i sorry his frown was a gorgeous attribute to his features i couldnthelp but think as he shoved his hands into his pockets i had no business going there i had no business taking it personally or whatever i just i thought about it and it was for good reason you didnttell me you know it makes sense it was i dontknow i just want you to know i sorry for what i said to you he nodded slightly and took a step back seemingly awaiting some sort of sign i had accepted his attempts at an apology thank you sirius i replied easily my lips feeling rather dry and my attire nothing short of disheveled but the way he looked at a person he made you feel beautiful just paying attention to you he swallowed and nodded again that wasnteasy for you i said with a slight smile and sirius grinned abc him and i on that december 29th found ourselves sitting together in the living room he still had a pair of roughed up looking cowboy boots on i noticed as he propped his feet onto the coffee table he seemed to be trying to act very au courant he folded his arms gently offered me a small smile and focused his attention on the television but he wanted to know what had been going on the past few days he didnt know what had been going on james and myself had been basically deserted for five days five days sirius wasnteven close to being au courant he had no idea what could have gone on between james and myself for those five days and no matter how sorry he was and no matter how much it was just my and james business i knew sirius wanted nay needed to know sirius i sighed drawing his attention to me and he offered a quick smile before turning ironically serious i had barely opened my mouth to say something when he he started talking it not such a strange thing because people talk sirius talks it a normal completely expected thing but when sirius began talking that morning he began talking like i hadntreally heard him talk before his voice got right deep and right quiet and i had to lean in close to hear what he was saying he began scrunching his nose up and then releasing it and then flicking the end of it with his index finger bent it was some kind of revelation sirius black did get nervous i understand lily that i may not know you as well as say james but i do know that i was the first boy to kiss those lips of yours and i take bloody pride in knowing that fact and i d never kiss you again if it meant that nobody else would either i could hardly help but smile it was just sweet and usually sirius black and sweet were quite the contradiction in terms but maybe maybe he thought he d get to me maybe he just got like that around me maybe once he did get to me maybe he thought i would kiss him and we d be back to that unknown grey area of not quite more than friends but not quite just friends i never thought i d see the day when i was a friend with benefits to someone i never thought i d see the day when i d have a friend with benefits and despite my smile and the fact he was a gorgeous boy who wanted to salvage kissing me in order to make sure nobody else would either i had to say it sirius i hated myself for using an obvious tone that tone that everybody uses when they re trying to break bad news or they re about to shatter somebody dreams that delicate sincere tone that you use and you reach a hand out to touch the person arm that what i did his features were set in a deep frown and he did not blink once as he looked at me his eyes were so pretty but no i had to say it i can promise you that i will be kissing other boys abc december 25th abc maybe you maybe you should go home with your dad i supposed i stared at james for much too long after he said that it was a suggestion that absolutely killed me it lacked strength it lacked integrity it lacked pride but it was something james potter was often missing pride he probably came from one of the most proud families in the wizarding world but how couldnt he have any how could he be such a damn pushover at times and the first words out of my mouth were almost as bad as his suggestion did you honestly just say that james why should i go with him god you re such a coward it was apparent to me that the only reason he wanted me to go with my father was because things hadntworked out too well with me and his mum in a split second james potter appeared to me as a selfish coward who wanted the easy way out in this he ignored my last comment and spoke as if he were calm at the moment why because he your dad what more is there to say i frowned at him and positioned myself more comfortably on the stair pressing my back against the wall and folding my arms what more could you say how about you invited me here for the holidays and at the first sign of something messing up you want me to leave and yes he is my father but he s he been so gone from my life for so long i ve grown up without him and you re not a maverick lily as independent as you try to seem you absolutely cling to people and i was just thinking hey you needparents the only reason i suggested you go with your dad was because after the whole house for sale incident i thought maybe you d want to try to to get something back in your life acheive normality again be a teenager with some weight off her shoulders james pushed himself off the wall was turning to walk away and in the midst of shaking his head when he abruptly turned back to me his eyes were narrowed hard as if he were trying to peer through some thick fog he thought i was being completely irrational of course hell lily stop acting so bloody stubborn and proud that man in there your father and you have no business turning him away not now if you do now you re just he trailed off as i shut my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall i could ve cried i wanted to cry it felt appropriate for me to cry right now because this boy was destroying me in every possible way james potter made me feel so alive he made me feel like i was significant and that every thing i did would somehow impact this whole world or at least the world of those around me but at the same time he made me feel tiny insignificant and overlooked but in a beautiful way in a beautiful way that stopped me from worrying so much about what i did what i said who i was to fall in love with i was living better breathing easier feeling young for the first time in years it was pleasant to know this world was going to keep going on whether i was with it or not but it was also pretty nice to know that my existence did somehow effect this place and at the very least james proved to me my existence did somehow effect him abc you are insignificant to the universe lily it couldntcare less whether you live or die i can tell you though it quite a different story in my eyes abc and so i wasntgoing to cry this christmas morning i could have very easily but at this early in the game it wasntfair to let that boy know he was destroying me i stayed leaning against the wall breathing steadily and trying to catch the breath that had escaped me for a moment james had stood there the whole time after trailing off and leaving his sentence so incredibly exposed and had not yet said anything else when i pried my eyes open there he was standing a few feet away running a hand through his hair and tipping his head to the side gazing at me with raised eyebrows and steadily blinking eyes it already happened hasntit he said in an easy murmur what has and me speaking looking so pale this morning and rather fragile i assumed in my dainty attire reminder skirt w sash and sweater that just didntseem to suit me affirmed his question you ve become this this incredible stand up he took a few steps forward and offered me his hand to pull myself up from the stair i stood up without accepting his hand though and just stayed at the bottom of the steps i awkwardly put my hands on my hips and stared at him with a hard frown he studied me for a moment his eyes darting this way and that taking in the outfit i was wearing and the length of my legs he licked his lips as he prepared to speak what i guessed would be a long ramble bloody hell this incredible woman you ve become this incredible woman and and that man in there is really only that to you isnthe a man who is your father only because his blood runs through your veins too you ve gone on and become somebody and your father doesnteven know you am i right he doesnteven know this own daughter it stung for a moment reality sinking in i supposed i was abandoned at some point and hadnteven realized it my parents had moved on with their lives and left their daughter to her own devices my parents in some ways were quite like the universe when it came to me i wasntsure they cared about too much that i did sure my father was here now but did he really care that i was at a boy house for the holidays or did he just feel obligated for once in his life to pay his youngest daughter mind did he just not want some bad reputation for his family brought on by me did he think me to be some kind of scarlet woman he wouldntreally know i guess so i couldntbe mad at him for that he didntknow whether i was a whore or not he didntknow whether i was in love or not he didntknow if i was a nice person or a bitch he didntknow me and james had said it i suppose you re right i said quietly my hands sliding down my front to smooth out the wrinkles in my skirt i ve grown up for nobody really i haventimpressed my parents any with it they donteven realize it i dontthink he doesntknow me there were two minutes of complete and utter silence i just stood there nervously fidgeting and he just stared at me with a crease to his forehead and his expression was almost that of disbelief sympathy i think i think he was giving me some silent sympathy in those two minutes when our eyes met and locked and i couldntquite imagine myself ever tearing my eyes away from him abc you and me by lifehouse abc before anything else could be said or done mr potter and my own father reappeared in the hallway i quickly turned to look at the two though james was a bit slow on the uptake and eventually took his gaze off of me to look at them mr potter looked satisfied though in an impatient way my father looked rather stubborn though weary he turned and quietly said something to jude and i held my breath hoping to be able to hear whatever it was james stepped out of the way as my father came over by the staircase and looked at me with a small smile you can stay here lily he said quietly reaching his hand out and giving my chin a nudge you deserve this you know you ve done well for yourself i just really sorry darling i gave his hand a squeeze and kissed his cheek quickly i guess i was surprised he had backed down from his demand but i didntplan on leaving whatever the decision might ve been i couldntpicture myself with my family during the holidays anymore or at anytime and it was a bit of a terrifying realization i was practically alone now thanks dad just know i never planned for it to be this way i would have never left for hogwarts when i was 11 if i had known i d never really be coming back and that was it he turned giving a brief nod to james and jude and walked out that door it was almost as if he was walking out of my life once and for all jude departed from the hallway without so much as a glance in my direction and james stood for a moment saying a single thing and then following after his father you look really nice lily abc december 29th that when december 29th happened it seemed in my mind that we had gone from that eventful christmas morning to an insignificant date like december 29th 3 days had passed without anything it was as if i hadnteven breathed in three days they were relaxing days we were able to sleep late the potter started going visiting more often so there wasntany mrs potter to deal with melly was over at times and she kept james and me from going insane we hadntreally talked much of the semi fight we had on christmas we ate breakfast without speaking a word to one another and all i think i said to him at christmas dinner was pass the salt i turned in early that night without properly thanking mrs potter for such a nice christmas and wrote my grandparent a letter i had taken to playing the piano in that abandoned room on the fourth floor and catching up on some school work it was surprising to me how easy it was to avoid james for days i knew that james had somehow found out what mr potter said to my father i liked to think he had crept downstairs like a ten year old boy in the dead of the night and stood outside his parents half open bedroom door listening i liked to think he was typical like that i liked to think that children actually did that to their parents i had never but i didntconsider myself typical i wondered what had been so bad about their conversation if james had found out i wondered why he couldntlook me in the eye for three days or talk to me properly i wondered just how badly i had been tainted in his eyes because of what he may have heard abc i can promise you that i will be kissing other boys instead of looking hurt after i said it sirius looked curious intrigued he propped his elbow up on the back of the couch and held his chin in his hand he had an almost smirk on his lips and then gestured with his free hand as if he were surrendering or proud of me you know what evans sirius spoke in such an easy casual tone that you wouldntknow i had just attempted to break his heart i think you re the first girl to reject me especially after i said something like that he offered a nod pushing himself away from me and into an upright sitting position i pretty proud of you sweetheart in indignation i raised my eyebrows and pursed my lips staring at him unblinkingly frankly sweetheart i not trying to make you proud i folded my arms uncomfortably and frowned down at the floor honestly was it too much to ask to just hurt a boy just to slap him over the face whether metaphorically or literally and leave him sitting there a complete mess it all a girl needs really reassurance she is strong it all i needed really abc i got up my arms still folded to leave the room that did not grow quiet as it may have with james it seemed to grow louder i could almost hear the clattering of dishes and silverware from the kitchen and his breathing seemed rather hollow and i did not know who heart was beating so loudly in my ears but i would have liked to think it was his what re you doing different with your hair he asked me just before i crossed the archway of the living room into the hallway the indignance had returned when i turned back around to look at him my forehead more creased than before i couldntmuch believe him at the moment did he really have to act this tough i ve got it parted differently and it s it curlier for christ sake i shook my head shortly a few times and just stared at him almost expecting more when he said nothing i took flight you are proud of me for rejecting you for promising you i going to be kissing other boys many other boys if i can help it jesus sirius haventyou ever had your heart broke before i think i felt kind of obliged to be the first one to do it but you re absolutely fucking impenetrable i pursed my lips stuck my chin out and turned to leave once again but sirius black seemed to have a knack for preventing you from doing that and what would it mean to you now if i said that you hurt me hmm what does it matter now sirius had sprawled his arms out over the back of the couch one on reach side and had slumped down on the couch a bit spreading his legs out and was tapping his left foot impatiently it does matter i want to know that i impacted you somehow admitting defeat i leaned against the frame of the doorway and looked at him helplessly from across the room lily think about it you want me to let a girl who barely even started to give me a chance know that she broke my heart come off it nobody exposes themselves like that you just dontseem to know what you re doing in any of this for the first time in the couple of months i had been semi involved with him sirius black looked like he resented me and i couldntblame him abc it was suddenly painstakingly obvious to me but we all forced ourselves to be painstakingly oblivious to how obvious it was the thing that was so obvious though was what i had done i had glided in and practically out of sirius live within a month and half and sometime during then i had gotten to james i had somehow met james head on and since then had become utterly devoted to figuring him out and while i was devoting my time to figuring him out he he was suddenly mine he undeniably mine he was my best friend now and it was me who prevented those almost brother like marauders from speaking on a daily basis it was me who had somehow come between them and i had stole james potter right out from underneath my once potential love interest i had done the one thing to sirius that no other girl had even dreamt of doing and even if i didntget the chance to dig in deep enough with him even if i didntbreak his heart it was apparent to both of us that i had definitely hurt damaged destroyed something but as i said we all tried to be oblivious to that fact throughout my being oblivious however i was proud somehow our pride played a huge part in all of it my pride over the fact i had james potter within my grasp was overwhelming and it was a positively terrifying thing to accomplish but i had abc you know sirius i took step away from the entrance of the room and stood with a lopsided posture my fingers laced together and my hands held daintily in front of me i really dont know what i doing in any of this i swallowed and bent my head down unable to look at that absolute man because it was suicide to a girl what i thought i was doing in all of this was was falling for you and having you fall for me and what i thought i d be doing with assuring you i d kiss other boys was was hurt you i guess i just thought we both needed it you needed to hurt and i needed to hurt someone i just thought we d be doing each other a favour but god sirius dontthink it all i set out to do dontthink you were just part of the plan or something both of us looked up and when our eyes met there was some kind of intense realization between the two of us he offered the slightest inclination of his head and i held my breath squaring my shoulders and waiting james he nodded some more and said nothing more i didntmean for it to happen for for him to know me better than you i didnt mean to edge you out of the picture in any way but it happened i guess i would love to continue kissing you and and having this crazy semi affair behind your friends backs but i so scared that all it d be it has to stop but only because i afraid it purely physical attraction between the two of us the grin that spread over his face was completely unintentional but a welcome relief he couldnthelp it of course and it was it was all right and is that so bad love sirius grin turned almost goofy and he slowly stood up stretching himself out no but i want to to try to find out if we can be friends first if he didntinterrupt me not verbally at least but sirius was now standing about a foot away from me with that wicked grin of his gone and an almost stern nervous look in it place you talk too much he said simply as i stared at him with wide eyes not saying anything pardon me i asked politely raising my eyebrows while he threw his head into his hands and roughly tugged at his hair and that you say that too much i opened my mouth to apologize sarcastically of course but the sight of him was enough to stop me he looked passionate i suppose with his grey eyes unblinking and his dark brown hair close enough to touch purely physical i found myself thinking as sirius took a final step towards me a slight frown over his face purely physical i thought again as i realized he was quite close to me purely physical i thought one last time before sirius leaned down to kiss me and because it was purely physical it was so hard to not want it again lips stopped just short of mine he was not going to kiss me he had no intentions of it he was not holding onto my arms like he would have if he was going to kiss me he was not touching me in anyway i wanted to stare into those manipulative eyes of his but if i had i would ve gone cross eyed due to his closeness instead i just darted my eyes back and forth catching glimpses of his and finally resting my gaze on his lips his lips were then moving so slowly and almost seductively he was talking i not going to kiss you sirius murmured and with the way his lips were moving he might as well have been you can stop looking so terrified i pulled my face back from his slightly just so we could could comfortably stare each other down i wanted to see his eyes i ohkay with being friends he told me quietly while i nodded then sirius eyes were going rather wide and he was taking a huge step away from me he was looking over my shoulder and only one thing was running through my mind james abc i dropped my hands to my side and clenched them tightly counting to ten in my head and trying to stay calm i just watched sirius he swallowed hard and ran his hand back through his hair he offered a quick quirk of his lips in the direction of what had to be james and then before i could even realize it he had left the room i heard him enter the kitchen with some boisterous greeting to the people in the room and i was telling myself that i had to turn around i had to face him i hadnt in three days i hadntproperly faced him in three days and now would be the time to do it turning slowly i crossed my right arm over and gripped the elbow of my left arm i raised my eyes up from the floor and saw of course james he offered me a small smile a rather content one that i hadnteven been expecting i didntknow what i was expecting though just not not a smile perhaps i had expected for the world to fall perhaps i had expected james to positively hate me perhaps he had seen nothing perhaps the fact sirius and me were standing close didntstrike him as odd and didntmean a damn thing to him maybe he forgot about that one single time i talked to him about sirius around the time of my birthday maybe james had forgot about that i almost had myself and this meant nothing to him or maybe he forgot about the time i talked to him about sirius so this would mean everything to him maybe he had no idea why his fellow marauder and myself were standing so close maybe he thought it was some kind of behind people s backs sort of thing and in essence that what it had i was waiting for something that did not come something like the story of my life waiting and expecting something completely different from what i d get it was nerve wracking and frustrating and i was so on edge from living the way i lived living as if nothing could surprise me because i expected the most obvious situations from life i expected so little i supposed from myself and the people around me that the waiting for something turned into living for something i guess smiling back at james potter turned out to be the simplest thing i d ever do in my whole entire life it would turn out to be the most gorgeous and invigorating thing to share a smile with him and right now wasntany exception i didntknow you were up i was just coming to get you for breakfast i nodded as he spoke and he smiled again though there was something playing behind his eyes that was a bit unnerving alright i couldntexplain anything now not when i needed to explain it to myself first not when i didntknow how he d feel about it not when i didntknow why sharing this with james was so damn hard i ll be right there james i watched him walk into the kitchen before slowly following after him abc kill the messenger by jack mannequin abc l e the most pathetic thing i ve realized about myself is that i a sucker for quiet nights my parents and the company are in the den lexi sound asleep sirius and remus have gone and i have a request for you meet me on the back deck if you think that perhaps we should start talking again 9 o clock j p i was shut in my room just laying on the bed trying to regroup from the rather tiring day when there was this incessantly annoying tapping at my window i ignored it fairly well for five minutes but eventually surrendered and opened the window a bloody owl flew in perched on the bed post and stuck it leg out for me to take the letter from it then it flew off i hardly had a chance to see who owl it was and what not but i just unrolled the parchment and read the letter i hardly recognized the hand writing james hand writing something that i had become fascinated with for quite some time was usually rather neat a bit large however and loopy it seemed as if he had wrote slowly and patiently and shaped every letter perfectly it was short and sweet and i realized that this is what it had come down to three days of not discussing things then a situation that could ve been blown out of proportion and he had to send a letter to me i wondered if he hated the fact he had been the first to to cave in or maybe the fact we hadntspoke properly for days was driving him as insane as it was driving me and perhaps he was going to let me be stubborn and proud this time it was ten to nine now and i hadntchanged out of my pajamas the whole day nor had i eaten much i had a wonderful mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows and i ate a muffin at some point but i was just thinking too much to be really hungry not even considering not going to meet him i decided to dress quickly i wore a pair of dark rinsed jeans and an oversized burgundy coloured sweater that was almost down to my knees i ran my hands through my hair that had become overly wavy that day and still held a tinge of the scent of my shampoo to it i rubbed my tired eyes trying not to disturb the mascara that i had applied in the early morning and then i left the room pulling the door shut after me abc and as i walked through the house quietly as to not disturb the serene feeling that had set in these past few days i absolutely hated the fact it was so beautiful especially tonight tonight there was some warm glow to every inch of the house and it smelled so endearing and it was what you would imagine the inside of a gingerbread house to be like warm and sweet and perfectly perserved but i hated it right now it was impossible to hate but i swore i did the warmth of the house was too comforting the atmosphere the holidays at created was too inviting and the only damn reason lily evans you re hating it so badly is because this isntyour home i hadntthought about it for three days i hadntthought about my own father for three days and really spending the holidays here was like suicide on my family life it was abc there was nobody in the kitchen or the dining room so i felt a bit relieved for not having to deal with anybody that night as i silently pulled open the sliding glass doors that did in fact lead to a deck on the back of the house it was large and the wood that made it up was lightly coloured there was a small round patio table and chairs set to the left of it and deserted flower pots sitting here and there to the right was one of those cushioned swinging seats and that where he was sitting though the seat was perfectly still the deck wasntclosed in and so it was for a split second like stepping straight outdoors into the below zero degree weather but i assumed a spell had been put on it and the air warmed slightly enough so that you could only barely see your breath it was comfortable still like you were sitting outdoors but in a more tolerable temperature the light from the moon threw my focus off for a second due to the angle at which it was hitting him at but when i got closer i saw him perfectly and grinned despite myself you re wearing it i said quietly and his at first undecided expression turned into a grin as well he was wearing the grey sweatshirt i had got him for christmas to replace the on i had took i loved the gifts thank you he said and he did sound as if he appreciated it sometime three days ago it had slipped my mind exchanging presents with james had slipped my mind after my father left and then james went to the kitchen and we hadntactually spoke my presents to james had been set under the tree removed from the couch and he must have kept my present in his room i didnteven realize you opened them he reached over to remove something from the seat as i sat down next to him the past few days have just been i trailed off hopelessly as he handed me what he had removed from the seat my gift the wrapping was so beautifully done that i could have just held it forever and beamed my appreciation for the packaging to him it was a glittery silver wrapping with patterns on it if you moved it a certain way and a silver and blue ribbon stuck to it my name simply had been scrawled out on the tag in his hand writing that i was familiar with just keep in mind i had no idea what to get you so my mum was absolutely brilliant and helped me out james told me as i gingerly tore into the wrapping it just too pretty to rip i muttered picking it apart carefully and being one of those irritating people he let me do it though take my time and keep the wrapping paper in perfect condition there was a white box inside and i lifted the cover from it carefully squinting in the dark to see a book was the first thing i noticed it looked rather worn and old and was obviously bought from a used bookstore the cover had beautiful art on it subtly so however i couldntsee the title in the dark but i just felt as if it d be amazing the second thing in the box fell onto my lap without me realizing it james lit his wand and shined it towards me lighting the second thing it was cream coloured and whatever it was looked gorgeous the matieral looked rather thin but was soft somewhere between cashmere and silk when i picked it up it felt like there was nothing in my hands and wherever it touched bare skin warmed instantly it a scarf james finally told me as i attempted to hold it out at full length and width it was long and had decliate frays at the ends and was just so pure looking so dainty and elegant and i suddenly wanted to wear a dress and a string of pearls high heels and this scarf it gorgeous i said quietly turning to him and grinning cheekily thank you i put the things back in the box and leaned back in the seat with a sigh slowly swaying the swing back and forth it was apparent to me that he didntwant to start it he didntwant to get in to it he didntwant to mess around with things neither of us wanted to really we were so content most of the time that we were together and it was rather hard to be anything but we may have become a lot in a short amount of time we may have been best friends but we hadntyet got to the point where we were comfortable with tearing each other down frequently we hadntyet ventured far enough to brutally hurt the other and then try to recover from it we were best friends apparently but we were playing it so safe when you were safe in anything you did you were not required to be hurt so days of miscommunication and one hell of christmas later we were decidedly unsure of one another it nice out here i chimed in after a few minutes of silence as james hadntsaid anything since i thanked him for the gift nights like these makes it seem like there isntanother soul out there doesntit he eventually muttered leaning his head back against the cushion and craning his head back looking up at the sky yeah i agreed with a nod noting the blank sky save for a few stars some wispy clouds and the large moon and you know what i d really like right now i curled my feet up on the seat continued the slow swaying motion that i had created and turned slightly to look at him what that he asked nonchalantly spread out rather comfortably with his feet planted on the ground in order to resist the movement of the swing for you to look me in the eye it was strange how life can appear however you want it to for a moment right then it appeared to me in slow motion my words didntseem to register with him for a second but when they did the rest of the world faded around him and i just waited for him to turn to look at me in the eye for the first time in days he slowly tipped his head forward and turned it to the right to where i was sitting and though they were narrowed slightly to see properly through the night his eyes were looking straight in my own wide eyes and he licked his lips before speaking in a rather croaky voice the fact that you noticed we haventmade proper eye contact is almost startling it not been a pleasant few days james i said softly looking down at the seat and then back at his hardly blinking eyes i donteven know how to talk about it i dont want to talk about it he stated simply suddenly and pleadingly he pulled his gaze away and returned to his former position staring at the sky james folded his arms over his absolutely fit chest and looked pouty i made a bit of a frustrated sigh and mimicked james position folding my arms and sitting back i stopped the swaying of the swing and put my feet flat on the ground staring up at the sky through the open side of the deck all right then let s ask me questions completely random ones i ll return them just something other than whatever it sounded fine to me and apparently i was feeling a bit risky just then let me see have you ever had sex the night seemed to completely stop because i i had went there i had ventured to one of those areas that james and me had silently decided to stay away from but i wasntabout to put up with a stubborn little boy tonight he didntwant to talk about what was staring us in the face understandably so i asked it the silence seemed like an eternity but then he was actually speaking you honestly want to know he raised his eyebrows and looked at me for a second before turning away again and resuming his pouty looking frown it was my turn to drift us into a silence because honestly i did not know i did not know what i wanted with with life with relationships with him did i want to know just how nice of a boy just how pure of a boy just how virgin a boy james potter was i didnteven know his middle name i didnteven know why the marauders were so close and i had to decide whether i wanted to know if he had sex or not um if i say no will you at least tell me your middle name i asked innocently knowing it was something he was rather hostile about no he fired back quickly the crease to his forehead i worried was going to become permanent tonight well then i the moodier james seemed the more determined i became determined and completely irrational thus being the explanation for the next words that came out of my mouth yes i want to know of course you would james muttered running a hand back through his hair bending over and resting his elbows upon his knees while peering up at me i sat up looking down at him pursing my lips crossing my ankles and folding my hands neatly in my lap i was going to make this impossible for him yeah lil i ve his hand was jumping to his hair every other second and eventually he just squeezed his eyes shut and said it i ve slept with a girl i ve yeah had sex jocelyn he frowned at his own inability to piece together a sentence and as i watched him sit up straight i had no reaction and he felt the need to justify it i was seventeen for god sake and swore that i was in love she was beautiful and temporarily perfect and it just it happens you know it just happened it was just you know it was a few times it was near the time we broke up and why arentyou saying anything because you look different now i murmured quietly pulling my legs up and crossing them gently folding my arms tipping my head back to the side and closing my eyes and it was some sort of sweet insanity that took us both over for five minutes of blissful understanding silence words were not enough for either of us that night and we were always so much better off just sitting with one another just being with one another was often enough but tonight it was it was too much what james and i had worked so carefully and quietly to create was suddenly before us and we had to accept it now before things became too hard to fix before we became too lost in it to give a damn what james and i had worked so hard to create was lies we were both relying on lies to see us through this friendship until that night but one way or another sex changes everything abc adia by sarah mclachlan abc hey babes you guys are unbelievably amazing reviewers and over 200 reviews you re too good to

as nothing else seems to work kisses chapter 17 they cantstop us now abc not what it seems by something corporate abc james i urged quietly opening my eyes a bit and seeing his head was again thrown into his hands he was quite motionless except for his fingers that were sliding further into his hair gripping it tightly he didntlift his head as i said his name and i sighed gently swaying the swing back and forth despite it all though it was a wonderful feeling being out there that night it was one of those nights that felt so alive or just reassuring i truly believed sitting there gazing out over the back yard that nobody in the world was going to be alone tonight it felt like everybody had somebody just for that night and the whole world was awake i didntknow why i needed to realize that to feel that way but it was reassurance that the world wasntfalling apart yet not yet james i said again louder this time and he eventually pulled his eyes up to me he had looked different in that one minute after he told me he had but not not like this somehow in a matter of minutes his eyes they were darker it seemed and i refused to believe that look in them was disgrace it wasnthim that should be disgraced just because he wasntquite as virgin as i thought he was i felt it was me that should be disgraced first of all for asking such a thing and second of all for saying he looked different for for seeing him differently because of it the brown in his hazel green eyes was completely overwhelming the green and i was left looking into a pair of eyes that could ve been on fire the way he had his back arched slightly with his elbows on his knees made it evident there was some tension coursing it way through his body and perhaps resting there in the small of his back i felt responsible i shook my head and inwardly cursed myself for today for bothering to wake up today at all how awkward did i intend on making things how hard did i need this to be but there was one other question that was burning me almost as terribly as james eyes were what were you thinking when you saw us referring to of course me being an inch away from sirius face that morning a spasmatic muscle in his left cheek made itself known through his suddenly clenched jaw and his frown slowly eased away he swallowed and i heard the sigh he let out was a rather long unsteady one i was thinking hell is she in love with him it remained sharp and piercing on the surface for a moment before he covered it with his goodnight i tired goodnight lily he offered a tight lipped smile which looked almost sad and stood up extending his palm slightly in a bit of a wave my mouth was so dry and i could feel my heart beating in my throat abc five minutes after james left me out on the deck i realized it was only about quarter after nine and he was not tired not at all but i was i was tired of having to hide these boys from one another because that what i was doing really james was such a mystery such a lovely mysterty and he was absolutely all i had at times sirius didntknow how close we were he did say he didntknow me as well as james but but that was just putting two and two together he doesntknow the know the ins and the outs of me and james and james doesntknow the ins and the outs of me and sirius i tried to not let that happen i didntwant it to happen i didntwant to have to be so secretive and crazy that crazy part of me though wanted to reverse the roles now my status with sirius had officially been changed to just friends and this voice inside of me was asking so is it james turn to be more than friends i didntknow but the realization hit me hard as i sat there completely alone save for the dark night large moon and faroff city lights i was actually asking myselfthat question about james abc i dontlove him i not in love with him james honestly i dont i ve never been in love no that too personal god i just my hands were twisting and grasping one another and my strides were quick and short not covering much distance of the hallway in front of his door just staying there and pacing i was pacing back and forth pause back and forth pause go to push the door open stop i adjusted the strap of my white tank top as i had taken my oversized sweater off when i came i couldntquite recall a time i had been this nervous how did i say it without sounding desperate and pathetic how did i declare the fact that his other best friend was now only my friend and i was not in love with him not even close how did i say that even though it was sirius and myself in the beginning it somehow ended up with james and i being friends him being amazing and me falling in love with so many moments and so many random irrevelent things how could i tell him that he changed but more importantly i changed maybe in the tiniest most insignificant way maybe i only appeared to change to myself maybe he was the most mesmerizing boy i had ever met and i had no idea why then i was talking to myself to him in a way it how i should have been talking to him it how i needed to talk to him it what he needed to hear and how we needed to be and i was just god i just hate the fact that i need you to know that i need you to know i not in love with him because if you know it then maybe it ll be over the secrets and the lies and the hiding i ve been so focused on secrets since we all became friends that i not sure i even know you does that sound awful i dontmean it to i just mean that there been a lot of secrets and i going crazy with trying to keep everything straight and just accept what i doing i cantbelieve i standing here trying to convince myself you that i not in love with a boy it just making me wonder if it always going to be this hard then and of course there he was he ran a hand through his hair as he pulled his bedroom door open and leaned against it i stared at james with eyes that i hoped werenttoo wide shadows were playing over his face in the oddest of ways giving the illusion of maturity for a brief moment that felt like my entire life i was seeing james potter as an aged man and i suddenly wondered whether he would marry a blonde or brunette he was shirtless i noted almost dully after getting over the inital shock of seeing him look so old for a flash of a second he wore a pair of pajama pants that dangled helplessly just above his angles they were rather short for him i stared straight into his eyes and gaped like some sort of mindless git until he spoke causing me to jump and break the eye contact i had no desire however to look him over james was a rather tall boy lanky and white but he had his fair share of muscles abdominal ones included but i did not notice any of that then tonight his eyes were tonight were you planning on talking to yourself out here all night or were you going to come in where he was lacking in clothing was made up for by the frown he wore it was a rather perplexed almost worried frown but he was still in a pissy mood as far as i could tell something absolutely warm flitted through his eyes when i did not respond but instead mouthed wordlessly he rolled his hazel green for a moment stepped to the right and opened the door further with one hand allowing me space to come in i went in and stood awkwardly by the bed with my hands folded behind my back as he went around to his side of the bed his side when did there become sides and climbed back in it he had left the door open halfway and the light in the hallway had been turned on so there was a comforting golden glow to the room i breathed slowly calming but still just stood there james laid on his back with his arms folded behind his head staring at the ceiling and sighing heavily once a few minutes of me just standing there passed it occured to me i did not know what to do climbing into a boy occupied bed was suddenly a thing i could not do but was going to because this was james and we were friends and dammit what else was i supposed to think he didntlook too impressed i realized as i shifted my weight and chewed on my lip rather vigorously he looked dark and troubled and it struck me that james potter never ever appeared that way to me before what on your mind james that dark expression turned to amused as he looked over at me standing with bent posture weight shifted to one side and still attempting to chew my lip off i didntwant to know what was on his mind really i didntwant to help further that demeaning almost sadistic personality he seemed to be developing but none of us were quite ourselves tonight i dontknow i a bit torn between being right pissed off at you for being a bit irrational and dramatic over the whole sex issue or being surprised because you had the audacity to ask me whether i have or not and then telling me i look different because of it his voice was low and rather rough but held an airy sarcastic tone to it that almost made me wince it not necessarily a bad different i offered delicately as i sat down on the very edge of the bed my back turned to him it more of an ohh different just realization i mean it made sense to me when i looked in your eyes and saw a different part of you i just it was startling i think i dontknow how to say this and not make you more pissed off at me he sighed almost defeatedly and it was obviously a task for him to do so no it ohkay you re not pissing me off any more than i already am i understand i guess he roughly messed his hair up and stifled a yawn picking at his comforter looking moody with his downcast eyes i just watched him i think expecting the world as i stretched my legs out on the bed and leaned back against the headboard i was expecting something profound to enter both of our minds at the exact same moment and we d somehow be in total sync again but then i realized he did not know who he wanted to be right now it was written all over his face his body language even in those eyes of his he was moody and understanding hard around the edges and soft on the inside cold and sincere rough and calm he was some foreign person to me tonight and i could not help but love and hate it all at the same time i dontwant you to think any less of me lily he began softly after a moment of adjusting ourselves because if you do i ll start regretting it and until now i ve not i dontwant to regret it but there you go you re a bit influential you know why would he regret it it was nothing to regret he didntsleep around he just he was with one girl who he called his own for months and months and he didntregret it it was all starting to become very heart warming in a bit of a jaded sort of way but this was coming from a girl who respected scarlet women perhaps not in all senses and perhaps not those who were drug addicted and lost but those scarlet women who carried themselves so easily i respected a woman who was able to prance in and out of a man life offering him her most intimate self and then was gone i respected them for being so strong and holding such an unearthly amount of pride and self respect despite her doings emotions were for the weak and i had long since accepted i was part of the weak i dontthink any less of you james i kind of respect you for it i guess in a weird way i think it s whatever i thought it was left my mind quickly when i heard approaching footsteps in the hallway and then a soft knock to the door it was inevitably dani abc somehow five minutes later i found my self with james sitting at the kitchen table with each of his parents looming over us apparently dani had come upstairs to get changed since the company had left and somehow ended up a floor above her own looking for james and no doubt she was looking for me too in simpler terms she was nosing around attempting to find out anything she could what she found was me in james bed the two of us struggling to pull the covers over me before dani could enter the room we didntsucceed and made it look worse off than it would have if i had just sat up and looked as if we had been talking dani stood with raised eyebrows for about thirty seconds as i climbed out from under the blankets and stood up one strap of my tank top had fell down and the front of the shirt was raised a few inches paired with my messed up hair ah there was no getting out of this one both of you come with me she said in a stern voice that was so much like professor mcgonagall i practically ran out of the room dani stood and waited for james to follow after her as well and i swore her eyes couldntget much wider as she saw her son was rather lacking a shirt he noticed that she noticed and he averted his gaze from her picking his comforter up and draping it around his shoulders so there we sat with the bright kitchen light hanging above us and mrs potter looking like she was capable of murder jude not so much he looked like he may have laughed if it wasntfor that rather worried expression he wore and for the second time that night this was going to be about sex abc james actually did look tired now as he was a bit hunched over and was squinting as he looked at his parents he stifled a yawn a couple of times whereas i was sitting there alert with my back so straight it was almost hurting dani sent jude a bit of a glare at which he cleared his throat and looked to her speaking quietly i sighed and then shivered due to the cold of the kitchen and the fact i was wearing a small tank top i shivered again and james turned to look at me with a bit of a smirk on his face i raised my eyebrows curiously at him and felt goosebumps prickling all over my skin there was something about a kitchen at night that made it cold a kitchen was a bit of an uninviting place when it was cold but i supposed it wasntmeant to feel warm right now as i slipped my hands up my arms warming them as jude and dani continued talking in ridiculously low voices james laughed he laughed it not as if this wasnt humiluating enough but he had to laugh at me because it cold in this damn kitchen and i was wearing a white tank top and it didnthelp me feel any warmer and it was obvious i was cold if you get my drift i glared at him promptly folding my arms across my chest and shaking my head at him calling his parents attention to us though we were rather oblivious to the fact i cantbelieve you were looking not to mention laughing at me i said with a frown and he just leaned back in his chair drawing his blanket tighter around him looking smug you dontfind this situation at least slightly amusing god we didnteven get to talk about the little conversation you had with yourself out in the hallway he turned serious for a moment and looked at me with a sigh just for the record i hate the fact we need so much r eassurance at the moment too dani scoffed at the two of us and we turned to look at her she had her arms folded and jude was rubbing a hand over his head looking rather weary despite the earliness of the evening all i have to say is be safe we dontwant jude began talking but dani interrupted rather shrilly may i add do you know how old i was when i got pregnant james she asked and i raised my eyebrows curiously i knew that she was not a young woman when she had him thirty four james said in a dull tone looking at his mum with a lazy gaze exactly and that when you should be having kids when you re that age not when you re eighteen mum james interrupted in a loud booming voice that startled me he sounded like his father for a moment with his blazing eyes and his firm voice james was a true potter and tonight it was becoming quite obvious i dontthink you have any right to stand here and tell us when we should be having kids and i especially dontthink you have the right to make such assumptions about lily and i first off have a little fucking james dani yelled but james continued faith in what lily capable of she not an idiot she not about to get pregnant do you know why in order to be pregnant you need to have sex and for the last time lily and me were not having sex when you walked in we haventhad sex at any time we just didntwant you to see her because you were so apt to either jump to conclusions or banish her from this house once and for all she an absolute darling darling james and dani each said the word darling at the same time james was referring to me and dani was of course referring to her son and for one split second i could barely tell their voices apart they each drawled the word easily pronouncing it properly with their practically identical accents and the strangest occurance of that night by far had been the simultaneous uttering of that word along with the realization that james potter picked up the occasional name for me from his mum it was a bit ironic i supposed that he chose to call the one person his mum seemed to dislike with a passion the affectionate childhood name that she used for him james stopped speaking and let his mother talk changing her tone to a more reasonable one or one a person may use if they re fearing for your sanity darling dani began again taking a delicate step towards her son i really dontthink the amount of time the two of you spend together is necessary oh for christ sake james rolled his eyes folding his arms and leaning his chair back on two legs i invited her here for the holidays what exactly would you like me to do all right jude interrupted suddenly frowning between his wife and son james you can watch your mouth and stop being so disrespectful towards your mother danielle listen jude eyes darted to me for a moment i believe james i believe that they were not having well i believe that they were just talking and i believe that they are just friends and what i think you have to come to terms with is why you re so threatened by he did not get the chance to say my name because if he had said threatened by lily all hell would have broke loose instead dani began shaking her head and holding a hand up to stop him before he could get too far ahead of himself he an eighteen year old boy and he was in bed with an eighteen year old girl you canttell me that he hasnt thought about it i shut my eyes in disbelief of this conversation being had in front of the two of us i couldntbelieve that they had the audactiy to talk like we werenteven in the room it was rather insulting if you want the truth to have these two adults talk about sex as if their son should never have it danielle potter was living in a bubble and i wasntentirely sure it was completely her fault could you stop talking as if i some kind of scarlet woman and james is an irrationally hormonal boy who cantkeep it in his pants please excuse me dani almost shrieked with her slender eyebrows raised high and her normally smooth forehead jaded with wrinkles lily right jude said with a sigh shutting his eyes and rubbing the bridge of his nose you can go all right just be safe if it ever just goodnight the two of them stood silent as james and me got up from our strategically set chairs and left the bright kitchen for the dimmer lit hallway goodnight lily he muttered darkly turning to go up the stairs and taking the blanket from around his shoulders i stood at the bottom of the staircase fiddling with a strap of my tank top just watching him go and for the second time that night my chance to assure james that i did not love sirius black just slipped through my fingers abc december 31st abc ruthless by something corporate abc he came into my room at 11 o clock in the morning on december 30th and told me to wear something nice for new year eve i just stared at him with his messy black hair and circles beneath his eyes it was as if the definition of something nice was lost on me wha pardon i asked blinking and shaking my head furrowing my brow as i concentrated on his words i was sitting at the vanity brushing my hair back and contemplating getting dressed when he came in looking sullen with his hands shoved in his pockets something nice like a dress he explained and i continued staring at him i didntget a chance to ask why because then he exploded honest everything about him the sullen state he seemed to be in was replaced by some kind of blacked out fury and the dark circles beneath his eyes werentnoticeable when his cheeks rather his whole face flushed red he ran a hand through his considerably messy hair and it made it even more messy his voice though his voice was quiet and rather calm when he first told me to wear something nice but was rough and to the breaking point as he yelled at me and his eyes were far too wide for james potter new year eve is often accompanied by parties my parents are having a new year eve party for some of their friends and for some of my dad co workers at new year eve parties like this one you often wear something nice like a dress because you want to impress at least a couple of high class sons of bitches with sticks up their arses that will be attending the party and i back to my god damn starting point wear something nice as we will both be attending this party at least for a bit all right he didntwait for my nod of understanding as he spun around rather aggressively and walked from the room slamming the door behind him abc i didntknow which i was more pissed off or scared he was like some raging maniac just because of what had happened last night personally i thought i was the one who should be holding a bit of a grudge but he just seemed insane and i didnteven want to talk about it with him it pissed me off that he thought he could come barging into my temporary bedroom and shout at me like that it scared me too though because james wasntthat kind of guy he wasntany sort of abusive he wasntthe guy that loses his temper in a moment of blind rage he wasntthe guy that would be too intoxicated to remember things properly james potter was something to look forward to he was someone to have a little faith in and someone who would make sense of the tragic flaws in your life without you even having to ask him to he had that subtle pride to him and those chivalrous aspects to him life fell apart at times but james potter did not people died hearts were broken and pleas for help would fall on deaf ears but james would be standing there tall and strong and it hadntyet occured to me how pathetic i was for having that picture of him in my mind but what had occured to me then was that i had absolutely nothing to wear that when at around 11 30 i found myself knocking on mr mrs potter bedroom door whilst tying my robe around me dani opened the door and did not look like the mrs potter i had come to know and well she looked tired i had heard her and jude start fighting before i reached the top of the stairs last night and jude was no where to be found in the bright bedroom behind her dani raised her eyebrows rather expectantly and did manage to look rather elegant in her silky dressing gown what is it on the bed behind her and even a couple scattered on the floor were dresses i um i just felt like i should tell you that i not sure i have anything to wear tonight under her invasive stare i straightened my posture and tried not to stare at my feet i not even sure what type of dress i should be considering abc 1 o clock p m abc mrs potter had however briefly glanced around her bedroom at the number of dresses she was trying on and then looked back to me almost appearing genuinely concerned over the issue of looking nice i think i have an idea she said a slight smile on her face i couldntquite decifer the meaning behind the smile but now that i was standing here on some girl doorstep who was practically a stranger to me i thought it must ve been malice behind that smile with a sigh i raised a gloved finger and rang the doorbell of this absolutely enchanting house it wasnta minute before the door was being pulled open by a beaming melly and a flutter of warmth was meeting my face it looks positively freezing out i cantget in the mood to wear a dress when it so cold she commented inviting me into her house and waiting for me to take my shoes off before leading me down a hallway and then up a staircase her house was decorated with warm colours and warm woods and though it was rather large there wasntany large spaces left untouched something filled every corner offering an unbelievably comforting feeling to the house the upstairs appeared almost small compared to the rest of the house due to the fact that two bathrooms were next to each main bedroom there were two bathrooms and three bedrooms including the large guest one that held two beds i couldnthelp but peeking inside the rooms and sighed in vain at how well decorated for the holidays they still were right through here melly bedroom was nice and girly and absolutely full it depressed me further when i realized i was in love with the colour of her walls they were a rather light coral colour with white trim and everything matched well there were three dresses laying on her bed and she stood uncomfortably at the end of it presenting the attire to me with a bit of an awkward gesture we re the same size i sure of it she encouraged in her pretty little voice as i gingerly picked up a rather sparkly dress and stared at it i didntbelieve her she was so tall and slim and sleek and pretty and i refused to believe that i wore the same size as the incomparable girl next door i hated the sparkly dress and didnteven bother to try it on it was silver and the sparkles on it itched terribly the other was made from a silky shiny material and was a dark green colour it was almost black depending on which way you looked at it the neckline plunged far too low and the back matched it i just didntfeel like exposing that much and perhaps encouraging the scarlet woman reputation the last dress was lovely it was a sapphire blue colour and was made from a satiny material though from the waist down it had an outer layer of an almost crepe like material the upper half of it was rather fitted and was in the form of a halter top but it flowed out at the waist and the skirt was ruffled and swayed around daintily i looked at melly and she grinned without saying a word i went to stand behind the changing screen she had up in the room and i slipped into the dress i kept my eyes shut and held my breath as it fell down my body to stop just above my ankles let me see pllleeeease melly demanded sweetly after a few minutes mustering up any confidence i could i stepped out from behind the screen and stood there allowing melly to offer her approval or disapproval she raised her eyebrows and looked politely surprised and moved out of my way to let me see into the mirror no i d rather not look i said rather mortified at her lack of comments on my appearance lily honestly was all she said with a sigh i looked into the old fashioned full length mirror that stood near the left wall of the bedroom and then i wasntsure who i was looking at somehow my waist appeared narrow and the way the skirt of the dress flowed out added to the length of my torso giving me the illusion of elegance and grace i looked the slightest bit taller and when i squinted my eyes tilted my head to the right and stared i was seeing the girl next door in myself i was seeing that pretty sweet and sophisticated girl in myself that i normally just saw in melly it was dizzying really to look into that mirror and not see a torn up lost girl but instead to see a grown up girl a woman almost you ll knock him off his feet melly commented quietly grinning widely i looked to her smoothing the material down over my front and returned the smile i hope so abc upon returning to the potter household i became rather shocked at the preparation needed for a new year eve party i recalled new year eve parties at my house would just be our family getting together and watching the countdown on television we d light sparklers eat seafood and the kids would try to steal sips of wine things were never carried out to this extent there wasnta caterer carrying trays of food up the stairs to a specific party room the lighting wasntaltered in order to look right for the party suits dresses and dress robes werentthe required dress code for the party it was just shocking to walk in the front door and see all of that and mrs potter was in a right mood with jude so she spent the entire afternoon getting ready jude spent most of his time in his study and james was no where to be found so i got curious and tried to find the room this party was going to be in not so surprisingly it would be in the largest room of the house which was the one on the fourth floor of the house that was completely empty save for a piano rug and window seat it was the room in that huge house that i had fell in love with because of james that night but in some way they were ruining it with the expensive decorations and long tables draped in white cloths with far too much food on it there was a bar set up as well and the only thing left the same was the piano in the middle of the room i guess that room just reminded me that even wealthy families donthave everything for some places that some places rooms minds hearts are just meant to remain empty it made me think of my home and my holidays and how things were with us simplicity is often more amazing than overwhelming visually dazzling materialistic things the stars appearing like diamonds on a warm summer night are worth far more than an actual diamond laying blandly in a bed of gold i thought maybe there were some things that nobody can ruin but somehow the potter managed to ruin even that lovely room that day abc the guests were to begin arriving at around 8 o clock and would disapparate up to the room the party was in lexi was sent over to melly for the night as she had her own plans while her parents would be at the party sirius and remus would not be over though it had slipped my mind as to why something to do with visiting family i wasntsure it seemed that james and myself would be the only teenagers there and i wondered just how much of an impression we were expected to make i shut myself up in my room and wore a dressing gown as i did my hair and makeup though it was minimumal i wore my hair in soft curls that made my hair seem longer than it was and i left it completely down not even putting any hair ornaments in it i applied some mascara blush and a pale coloured gloss to my lips i wasntone for eyeshadow so i just smoothed on a nude coloured shadow that just illuminated my lids a bit without overdoing it when i put the dress on i only briefly looked at myself in the mirror afraid there d be something different about the way it would look in this house and then i waited until about 8 30 not entirely sure what i was waiting for not then at least but it was james potter he was what i was waiting for he was what i wanted right then i just felt as if it should happen that he should show up at the bedroom door knock twice and then extend his arm with a boyish grin upon his face not saying anything of my appearance until the end of the evening i was waiting for my escort but he did not come so i left for the party myself walking up to the next floor because apparation was not an art i had yet mastered the strappy shoes i wore were killing my feet already as i neared the top of the staircase and i sure i was grimacing as i came into view of the other guests abc 9 o clock had come and it was about quarter after i stood awkwardly inside the room of the party as more elegant gorgeous fashionable looking people made their way inside mr and mrs potter were a picture of perfection standing near the door and greeting everyone they sure knew how to play happy even when they werenthappy with one another i was sure they had played happy a few times before jude wore a suit when other men wore dress robes and the women stuck strictly to dresses this was their one night to go all out and they certainly liked their diamonds i smiled at some familiar faces james aunt and uncle melly parents and was forced to introduce myself as james friend to people who would come over to shake my hand i could imagine how good that looked saying i was james friend and standing at that damn party all alone this was nothing special to me i dontmake new year resolutions and i dontfeel any different when the clock strikes midnight and the new year presents itself all dark and full of fireworks i believe as cynical as it is that it just another reason for adults to get drunk and promise themselves they will do better in the next year even though they don t i felt useless and as if i was a child playing dress up standing there just watching couples mingle and dance drink and eat when i glanced the small silver watch on my left wrist and saw it was almost 9 30 i felt like crying i made my way over to mrs potter to declare i was leaving and that i hoped she enjoyed herself then he came through the door abc james did not immediately see me but i immediately saw him and wondered how i ever missed him because i certainly had i hadntbeen seeing him properly and clearly the past few days he looked worn handsome and debonair suave and sophisticated but worn his hair didnteven seem to have the energy to stick up it was lying flat save for his fringe his eyes were a bit lackluster as he looked around the room but the suit he wore did him good it fit him amazingly well and though the tie was a bit crooked he looked breathtaking his face was clean shaven and his glasses set straight on his nose as he adjusted the black suit jacket he wore and continued his scan of the crowd whilst smiling at a few people and somehow i was rushing over to him hoping he noticed me before i tripped over him or something he as fate would have it did notice me clutching the excess fabric of the dress as i walked fast over the wood floor towards him his adam apple protruded a bit as he swallowed and turned to face me running a constant hand through his hair i was breathless fitting i supposed as i came to a halt and had to say it what i had been trying to say for two days i not in love with him abc my eyes searched his incessantly through his steely stare the twisted sort of relief was obvious though he said nothing as he took me by the crook of the elbow and led me through the crowd of people let make the rounds shall we he muttered as if his teeth were clenched while he smiled at people widely make the rounds i hissed wrenching my arm from the painful grip he had on my elbow i ve been making the rounds for about an hour who do you think you are leaving me at your parents party alone i apologize but i had some business to attend to quite suddenly we were stopping to shake hands with a mr and mrs parker and i noticed dirt on the hand he extended to be shook he noticed too as he quickly offered the other one where were you i was about to ask the same question but mrs potter came up behind us looking at her son through narrowed eyes mum hi lovely party quite the turn james began in an airy tone but his mother cut him off first thing is it a full moon she asked curtly eyeing james beat him looking hands i frowned and averted my attention because frankly this conversation wasntmaking much sense to me had i kept my attention on them i would have noticed the short slightly sympathetic nod james offered his mum and the one she offered back abc james grew quiet after a few minutes and less aggressive than he had been over the past couple of days we wandered aimlessly around the large room stopping for cups of punch and to watch the middle aged couples dance and try to impress one another when james spotted a couple he knew would want to check in with him he played on the qudditch team with their son he quietly suggested we go over to talk to them and i was so pleasantly shocked when i felt his hand grasp my own that i decided not to pull it away there was something tired about him that night and it showed through his occasional heavy sighs i wanted to yell at him for acting like such a bastard lately but then i wanted to go sit with him in a quiet corner of the world and hold his hand forever it how he made me an absolute mess so i just stood next to him acting like a trophy wife would except for i was enjoying it enjoying the fact people liked my dress and enjoying the fact i could stand next to him and have people wondering but know that we were just friends and i could watch him watch him rub the bridge of his nose when he thought no one was looking and watch him flick at the end of his nose and rub his index finger beneath his cheek all because this was a bit overwhelming and i could watch him send me small almost nervous smiles when no aging couple was attempting to strike conversation with a us perhaps the smiles were small and nervous because he knew i did not like him this way i did not like not knowing him and feeling as if i had done something wrong i didntlike waiting for him to decide when it was time to talk and he knew it the most important thing though that i ever watched james potter do was become the one person i wanted to be with for my entire life however long or short that may be he did an amazing job at becoming that person too abc at 10 30 my feet were aching and i decided the party wasntworth losing my feet over so i politely excused myself to the overly tanned and wrinkled woman going on endlessly about a trip she took to some sunny place and i couldnthelp but wonder if in ten years melanoma would be her undoing i slipped into the background casting a glance around to see if james was still talking to his father collegaues and then left through the doors i shut the doors behind me and stood in the middle of the wide hallway rather amazed that some simple spell had managed to block all of the sound from the party from leaking out there was feeling of emptiness residing deep in my stomach and was slowly gnawing it way up to my throat when the wave of it hit me it left my eyes unblinking and my forehead with creases ignoring it i took a few steps forward wrapping my arms around myself to fend off the cool air of the hallway and then was sent almost dizzy when another feeling overspilled from some locked up closet within me uselessness was a terrible thing but in that moment it how i felt i didntknow why for a minute but then things became clear became horribly clear just as james potter was becoming horribly clear i was wearing a beautiful dress that was not my own and i appeared well mildly attractive in it i stood in a party for the better part of two hours and did not dance once because my mind was apparently lethargic and could not quite comprehend what to do i didntwant to move the wrong way or say the wrong thing but i did not know what was right and what was wrong so i just stood uselessly nothing seemed to be penetrating my surface that night the compliments i had gotten on my flaming red hair and my dress fit for the queen did not mean a damn thing to me because those people didntmean a damn thing to me this world hardly meant a damn thing to me and i was just taking up space in it buying myself time until i could leave it again what was i doing with my life that was of any use to myself it was of use to other people sure i was head girl and i was forced to patrol the grounds during the evening leaving the professors and other students to their relaxation but the classes i attended and the detentions i handed out were nothing to me they just helped that void within me be made deeper and darker and filled with wonderment the only thing that would help myself in the months to come was sanity and strength it rather amusing how i lacked those things until i made myself wake up one day not so long from now abc somehow that wasntas surprising or strange to me as maybe it should have been i had made my way back to my bedroom without even realizing it and now i was sitting on the edge of the half filled bathtub with my feet in the warm water i had pulled the dress up above my knees so it wouldntdrag in the water and my shoes had been discarded somewhere between the door of the bedroom and the bathroom the ache in my feet was just the price i had to pay for temporary beauty of something nobody was looking at it anyway my thoughts screamed to me trying to tell me what an idiot i was for thinking the way i did for about a minute i recalled i had stood with my wand looking at my feet trying and failing to come up with a spell that would diminish the soreness of them so being the girl i was i drew up a warm bath for my feet i swished them around listening to the inexplicably calming sound of the disturbed water and then began humming to myself it wasnta completely tuneless hum as it had meant to be or perhaps it had meant to be happy go lucky but did not turn out that way it turned out forlorn as if it had been on my mind for weeks and was just making itself known now a sad mournful tune that would be fit for a widow to hum or a congregation to hum at a funeral i hated the jagged jaded way my thoughts were presenting themselves but it must have been healthy from me a healthy change a healthy reminder donttake your sanity for granted as i finished the hum on a rather low note and stared at my bleary reflection in the water the inevitable sound of james voice came echoing through the bathroom that was he began from somewhere behind me though i didntlook at him his voice held some hint that he hadntbeen standing there long because he did sound relatively surprised at the scene he was walking in upon i couldntblame him i sure i would ve been surprised too had i been in my right mind at the time unintentionally depressing i finished for him easily earning a chuckle from him it fitting though things are unintentionally depressing out there the out there he was referring to could have been anything but i got the distinct impression he meant out there in the real world but tonight i was not going to push that issue i turned my head round to look at him and then felt some of my insane emptiness ebbing away all that i could think of was the fact that he was here now and that he was as useless as i was tonight he looked a lot like a sad young boy on my first glance as he stood leaned against the frame of the door with his hands shoved deep inside his pockets james looked as if he had run out of something tonight a thought that kept coming back to me weary and worn and running out of something if not everything james was not wearing his suit jacket and his tie was missing as well his button down shirt was undone near the chest and a white ribbed cotton tshirt could be seen there instead of the bare flesh of his chest i was a bit disappointed i admit but his disheveled appearance as a whole was enough to make up for the lack of provocative glimpses of skin the cuffs of his shirt were unbuttoned leaving the sleeves loose from his arms when he looked down at his feet small shadows formed around his eyes due to the generous amount of thick black eyelashes he had and for a moment i was jealous of the undeniable piece of art that he was abc i did not ask him to sit with me on the edge of the tub but he ended up doing so anyway with no complaints from me james kicked his size eleven shoes off pulled his socks from his feet rolled his pant legs up and slipped his feet into the lukewarm water in the bathtub do your feet hurt as well then i asked as he gripped the tub on either side of where he sat and stared into the rippling water and before answering he asked if i was imagining the lake at hogwarts too yeah yeah i am i told him quietly and he offered a quick nod no my feet donthurt he told me in a murmur james shrugged his broad shoulders and continued i just sitting here with you it was an obvious explanation of what he was doing that very moment and i could quite easily see that with my own eyes but hearing him say it made my heart beat a little faster i just sitting here with you have you made any new year resolutions i pressed on after a few minutes of just swishing our feet around and splashing the water up each other legs mmm he sighed warmly it was a warm sigh a warm almost exhausted sigh that i could almost feel breezing it way over my skin no with a cheeky grin he returned the question i ve not no if i were to make one though i took a breath and considered it i d probably declare honesty james cut me off and i looked to him with a raised brow you would declare honesty hearing him speak and telling me what i would declare put me off a bit and i couldntquite remember what it was i was going to say because you re an honest girl and you ve not been able to express that honesty much in the passed couple of months he spoke almost lazily and with ease that was the expression resting over his face too you would promise the new year that you were going to be honest from here on out but would somehow get caught up in the whirlwind of deceit and lies all over again i parted my lips to say something but the only words there were the same words i said earlier that evening for reasons i dontknow so i said it again i dontlove him it was startling even to me when my voice came out rather weak and croaky and as if i were on the verge of tears for one long moment i swore the night was going to end before midnight before any sort of sweep me off my feet before any sort of act of new year admiration but it did not james smiled wryly and reached a hand out to the bunched up length of my dress and there was a question in his eyes for a second of my grace and elegance wondering whether i truly had any as he ran his hand over the fabric clenching his jaw and finally swallowing for relief he nodded would it be terrible of me to say good and suddenly it hit me they couldntstop us now abc the new year by death cab for cutie abc chapter 18 into the abyss abc walking by by something corporate abc 11 30 came eventually and i found myself staring through a window out into an unnervingly dark night the sky was some sort of silky smooth black expanse lacking any stars to ebb away the perpetual darkness the moon wasntin my range of view from this window and i found the dark of the hallway combined with the night was suffocating for one brief moment that could have very well lasted all of eternity i was overcome with the feeling of death it was engulfing startling and choking but in a second it was liberating and dizzying but strange i frowned after the feeling passed and i was left with a heavy something deep inside my chest i took steady large gulps of the cool air of the hallway and wondered if it was just the dark of the night offering me these cruel sensations or if it was something to do with what was going on in the dark of the night shivering due to my rather cynical thoughts i sighed and sank down further into the armchair in the hallway so strategically placed next to a coffee table and the wide window that let you see forever out of it i had changed into a pair of navy flannel pajamas and my hair was a bit messy as it flowed over my shoulders for the first time that night i was feeling remotely comfortable and was completely alone any again remote sexiness i had experinced while wearing that pretty dress with those pretty shoes and the pretty makeup had long since vanished probably around the time james stood up from the bathtub wiped his feet off with a towel and then tossed the towel towards me he declared quite suddenly and stealthily that he was returning to the party in order to offer proper goodnights and happy new year to the men who were hounding him but an hour earlier to take a job with the ministry as soon as he was finished with school i stared at him trying to make my mind work as he went through the doorway of the bathroom back into the bedroom bent to pick his discarded suit jacket up and was about to leave the room but i could not think of a thing to say that would do this night justice i couldntsay anything that would be rude to either james or sirius and i wasntsure just how i felt about him being glad impartial i supposed because i really knew that he d be glad but what was i to do smile and tell him that ohkay you re not terrible you re not supposed to want your best friends to be happy nothing in my mind would suit what tonight had become and oddly enough it felt right that way often between us saying nothing spoke volumes and so that how i was sure the night was to end between the two of us james quietly dismissing himself to his upscale new year eve party where he belonged and me quietly swishing my feet around in a nice bathtub that did not belong to me there was nothing for me to say no way to pick conversation up from there and make it seem real and not forced and i thought he d be the one person to understand that seeming the whole damn night was fraud and forced happiness that feeling of death was the first feeling i had actually recognized since i wandered out from my bedroom into the hallway where james and me had sat observing the city when i had first arrived here after i let it absorb into me and let myself consider it maybe it wasntdeath i had always imagined the feeling of impending death whether it be my own or another s would feel cold and terrifying but i was warm in my flannel pajamas and wasntterrified i was curious liberated as i thought at first maybe i thought just maybe it was catching my breath i felt and that was also the first pleasant thought i recognized since james left for the party again catching my breath sounded like a lovely thing to do and no better time than now to do it abc hold that thought though because the precise second that my eyes fell shut and i began breathing steadier pushing that suffocating mental brush with death from my mind completely james was collapsing into the armchair next to mine with a heavy sigh adjusting himself until he was slumped down far in the chair with his legs stretched out to the coffee table he had startled me and took me by surprise so badly that i was left gasping for breath and clutching a hand to my chest feeling my heart thump quickly against it we ll be able to see fireworks from here james told me calmly paying no mind to my possible heart attack situation the city will be having them and then some people just light them in their back yard for the hell of it he was however slowly getting away from that party look now wearing a pair of pajama pants paired with his completely unbuttoned dress shirt the white ribbed tshirt still beneath it he looked rather satisfied though unlike how i expected him to be after what i thought was an exhausting evening it occured to me james potter really did belong at those sort of social gatherings and he enjoyed it it all he had ever known after all beautiful people beautiful things and social gatherings he had learned how to recognize the important people early on and knew how to charm those important people from the day he was born it was bred right into him being lovely and suave and sophisticated and for that i hated him when i did not respond to him much like earlier that evening he continued speaking i know why arentwe in the back yard lighting fireworks off well for one all the drunks upstairs would go a bit mad thinking they were going to deaf or something due to all of the explosions and i ve not got any home with me zonko was all out of filibuster s naturally and sirius ran off with the rest of my lot thankfully he trailed off and picked up on my dirty look that was given to the cool looking glass of the window all right lily it would become a popular catch phrase almost with james as he said it i pursed my lips and refused to look to him he sat up all business and aristocrat like are you angry about earlier pairing my pursed lips with a turned up nose i began to speak voice full of indignation and found myself uttering the one word i had not meant to no he seemed as momentarily surprised as i was but then i sighed shortly after and it made sense i not angry no james the two of us waited for me to say what i was if i wasntangry disappointed i murmured to him in the form of a question was it disappointment was it anything at all i didntknow i just knew that i didntlike him leaving like he did and damn it i told him that too he nodded once i told him and looked as frustrated as i felt rubbing at his face roughly and tugging his hair until it was standing up at odd angles i didntknow what i should be he wasntyelling but trying to through his hoarse voice and heavy sighs i didntknow what to tell you quieter i didntknow how terrible it would be to say i was glad but in a way i ve decided i am glad i am glad that you re not in love with him because lily when you do love somebody i just where this was going was beyond me i just started at him not anything but taken aback and listening so intently too intently to his hardly above a whisper voice i just dontwant to miss it you know i just felt like whoa where the hell have i been when i seen you it strange how i just really really hated it he went on to say he not only hated thinking he had missed something between sirius and i but he hated realizing how distant the marauders had been over the past while and the one thing that surprised me the most that night was the last thing he said with a clenched jaw and in a completely indescribable tone of voice stubborn let down strong i couldnttell what it was i hated realizing after seeing the two of you so close that the marauders have been pretty distant lately and and then i realized that i dontknow if i care i dontknow if i want to get back to acting like an immature prat and i ve spent such little amount of time with them that i donteven know if i still like my friends anymore you know i just he rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses and then slumped back in the chair adjusting his feet on the coffee table it been about you lately abc there was the strangest burning sensation climbing into my throat as my stomach tumbled unpleasantly it was as if a weight had been dropped inside of me and landed ungracefully in my stomach sending what could only be burning guilt coursing through me it was because he was laying the blame on me however intentional it was i did not know but it was there a pointed finger a reason for the distance a cause for their lack of interest with each other it was all laid on me piled on smothering dizzying me until i realized it was far beyond my control now there was no turning back nothing i could do to just up and let james go and watch them go back to being the way they were friends i couldntfix it especially when he was thinking he didnt want it fixed i had possibly destroyed the one thing i admired about the boys from the beginning before the beginning and watched it go down in flames with a smile on my face i had interferred invited myself in and claimed one specific marauder for my own keeping that girl with the red hair milky skin and green eyes me had done the unthinkable and they all knew that it was the unthinkable they all knew it was morally wrong among teenage boys a girl wasntsupposed to come between friends friends like them a girl wasntsupposed to do that and what did it say for them letting a girl do that it said they were as weak as the rest of us and as desperate for something anything everything to complete them they were human and their friendship apparently wasntmade to outdo the rest it came back to me in the end though and the fact that i hadntmeant to do it nor wanted to do it i hadntwanted james or sirius or something with either of them and i thought it to be worse because of that because it had been so unintentional and done so naively i had taken the one thing from those four boys that i had never really had for myself and i couldnt possibly understand the impact of that i was guilty and i felt sick with my sweaty palms and suddenly chapped lips but i was alive and it felt good to know something was for sure as i watched james stare out the window into that devouring black night it like we re headed into an abyss he said quietly and as i turned my gaze from him to the window i realized he had never been more right the two of us just sitting there at the end of a deserted hallway staring out into a more deserted night my eyes strained to see some source of light some assurance there was life out there the lights of the city were nothing but a dim glow as if from an outside world and if you sat completely still and held your breath you felt dizzy and as if you were flying into the dark night into an abyss absolutely alone in the whole entire universe except for the messy haired boy next to me an abyss the night was somehow an abyss and we had somehow found ourselves getting pulled into it into oblivion in so far that you felt as if you were slowly being crushed beneath something far stronger than you expected and your heart just might explode if you didntdo something quickly but in a moment it was over we were back in reality and the wide eyed wonderment that had taken over me was replaced by an appreciative smile as the loud always anticipated crackling explosions could be heard then the sky was suddenly illuminated by a hundred different colours a hundred different patterns fireworks they flew straight into the sky and seemed close enough to touch but really were rather far off they erupted into colourful fragments leaving the sky dotted with the after effects and it was 1978 abc to me it was just midnight it was just a night when fireworks were sent into the sky and people were far too impressed by them a night when the clock struck twelve wine glasses everywhere were clinking together in welcome of the new year and every girl in the world who was half heartedly excited by the notion of a new year had a boy to kiss it made sense that i didnthave one to throw my arms around at the strike of the clock and kiss passionately because the new year made me so dispassionate what was there to look forward to honestly school exams and little did i know then death the destruction of a society would rest on this new year and dammit if i had known i would ve found a way to stay in 1977 until i died but you had to embrace it you had to accept the fact sooner or later and wonder just if the nights would be more restful if the days would grow brighter if this new year was going to be the best of your life if you werentexcited thrilled or exhilirated by the coming of a new year you were curious i was curious sitting there next to james with my legs crossed up in the arm chair and my hands folded in my lap when the fireworks started i sat with my back a little straighter and my head a little higher observing the night with careful bright eyes because whatever cynicism had embedded itself in my mind years before couldntpush it way through that one single hopeful thought that i couldnt help but let cross my mind can things only get better from here in a way that was blunt and real the answer was absolutely not but in a desperate breath taking way that i came to absolutely thrive on the answer was god yes things ll get better for me they had to abc it struck me just as midnight had struck about five minutes earlier that the reason i was sitting in an eerie looming silence when it was passed midnight new year eve finest hour was because james potter and myself thought ourselves to be such callous and jaded cynics i had been eighteen for just over a month him for just ten days it was extremely naive and foolish of both of us to have wasted away our teenage years on being so pessimistic and paranoid remus was though the most adult of all of us and sometimes i wondered if i should call him sir because he seemed that beyond his teenage years sirius did too maybe a little less than james but only because sirius had reason to be jaded and hard hearted and tried not to be peter pettigrew even understood the positive side of being negative as much of a paradox as it was though he was a bit childish and slow i was disgusted with it i think disgusted with the thought of having lost that clich d childhood innocence because i had forced myself to lose it i had grown up but frankly i didnthave the slightest idea of how to be grown up i thought maybe i did but the world proved us wrong and showed us just how unprepared we were and how useless it was to be so stubborn towards happiness then james potter was bidding me goodnight and with a glance to my small watch i saw it was quarter after midnight and we had not spoke since we had been sucked into that abyss i did not want to talk anymore and neither did he or perhaps we were just unable to talk anymore because all we seemed to be doing was butchering everything we had acheived so far which at the moment wasntlooking like much and somewhere in our subconcious we knew better than to carry on with things like they were that night abc at half passed twelve i left the hallway and the black night behind turning into the bedroom and shutting the door gently kicking the shoes i had left by the door out of the way i walked towards the large bed tossing the dress from the end of it in a brief temper tantrum and then laid down upon it for a few minutes i was aware of nothing but the soft bed and warm comforter and just allowed myself to sink down into the mattress after those few minutes of not being aware of anything i became sharply aware of the fact that my eyes were not closing they had no desire to close no desire to be rested with a frown i turned onto my side and stared over the room at melly crumpled dress and the pile of christmas presents sitting in a corner of the room feeling as if these few things were a distraction from sleep i turned onto my other side and stared at the wall and at the window or i was pretty sure the window was there no light was coming in through it the darkness of the night matched the darkness of the room and suddenly that warm bed became a rather suffocating place to be i clambered out of it tripping slightly as my feet met the floor and i grabbed my wand from off of the bedstand lighting the couple of oil lamps in the room with a single wave of it the warm glow of the two lamps was a bit of a comfort though in a moment it changed to some sort of oddly obscured comfort the small flames in the lamps made the bedroom appear to quiver as new shadows crept up the walls and along the floor and i realized i greatly preferred the darkness to the dizzying dance of the flames around the room my stomach took an unpleasant lurch as i just stood in the middle of the room one foot on the dress of melly s and at that i surrendered to a long hot shower the long hot shower really did me wonders and i calmed down a bit though there was a pattern with my thoughts as i unnecessarily washed my hair for what would be the second time that day they dwelled on my house that was for sale that really wasntmy house at all and sirius black there was just one nagging thought that had been planted there by remus ages ago sirius and how he became miserable when he was hurt and how miserable he was being covered up by some wretched anger and all he did when he was so wretchedly angry but really miserably hurt was breathe and have sex miserable sex that guilt from earlier was somehow intensified when i wondered just how much miserable sex sirius would be having after these holidays abc it was getting on two o clock and all i was interested in was the fact my hair was still very damp sleep wasntwithin my radar at all i laid on top of the bed using my hands and feet to make shapes on the walls and i laughed a rather manical sort of laugh everytime i glanced the clock and felt no closer to sleep than i did to finding god or some sort of religion or love or a family or anything sleep was as far gone as peace and hope for a better future was it was as gone as my rational part of thinking my positive outlook on life i damned remus and the rest of the marauders for that and as it got on two o clock and one of the oil lamps flame flickered out of life a sudden loud consistent knock came to the bedroom door i hurried to it knowing the knocking was only loud because the person on the other side of the door was probably certain i was sleeping but i was not and had never felt more upset by that than i did tonight this morning at two a m it was without a doubt james on the other side of the door and that where he stayed standing hardly moving a muscle he was handsome looking yet a moody darkness was etched into every corner of his defined features his eyes were bright though i dontthink i had ever seen his hazel green look so dark his jet black disorderly hair was oddly enough falling along his forehead and was protruding more near the back it gave him a sort of roguish grace the way it curtained his blazing eyes and offered him that blas gleam that sirius often posessed james was right then a walking talking contradiction who was leaning against the frame of the doorway on his right arm and his left hand was tugging back through his hair trying and failing to remove his fringe from his eyes when i pulled the door open he splayed his right hand over it as if to prevent me from abruptly closing it or something he straightened up a bit most of his weight still leaned against the doorframe and from where i was standing on the other side of the door i could hear his slow steady breathing for a moment i thought that was all he came for just to stand there and breathe and loom over me in a way eventually after probably two minutes of nothing but shadowy stares he began speaking and he was speaking in a voice that made me grip the edge of the door rather hard and that made my head swim as i fumbled to grasp his words his voice was low and deep holding a completely serious tone to it that burned it way into my heart the impact of what he was saying for once wasntlost on me him standing here now was completely random yet the most important thing he could ever offer me abc globes and maps by something corporate abc lily james began needlessly because i was the only one standing in front of him it has been about you lately because i ve wanted it to be about you the unpleasant sensation that had entered my stomach at midnight was slowly and unbeknownst to me at the time fading away this is not as one sided as you seem to think it is you did do some forcing to get us here yeah but contrary to popular belief you did not force yourself between anybody you made your way into my life and if the marauders and me arentlike we were it our fault and not yours not a bit your fault for making me feel so i dunno just better ohkay i dontwant to see that look on your face again and i dontwant you to not be able to utter a single word to me again by now his voice was easing into a lighter less earnest tone and by the time he was finished speaking he had me in the palm of his hand you ve got nothing to feel guilty about lil he had lowered his eyes from the gaze he had formed with me and slowly in a mesmerizing way raked his hand back through his hair pausing and holding it for a moment before looking back up and bringing his hand away from it now the beautiful bright aspect to his eyes was astonishing and pushed away the surreal dark that had settled into them i stepped away from the door allowing him room to enter without a word because earlier when i couldntthink of anything to say couldntpossibly form any words that was because the bottom of my stomach was falling away and was replaced by some strange sickening turning now i couldntthink of anything to say because he was so genuine and integrity was just dripping from every damn word abc as he stepped inside the room i closed the door while observing his attire pajama pants and a grey tshirt he had finally discarded the last of his formal wear he wore a pair of socks as opposed to me my feet were chilly and bare i was enjoying the cool dampness from my hair touching my shoulders and had put a tanktop underneath my button up pajama shirt which was completely and sloppily unbuttoned now when the dim light hit him the right way i could see the outlined goosebumps along his arms and i had to smile wryly at what opposites we were and how we never bothered to hide that fact likely because we never really realized that fact or didntrealize the monumentality of it james paused near the shoes i had kicked off bent down and set them up neatly he made his way towards the bed stretching and yawning looking rather weary but satisifed then he threw himself down on the bed horizontally his legs sprawled out and his feet planted on the floor do you know what i was doing last new year eve he asked me and his voice seemed to echo through the large room i however was thinking of how i could get the bedroom door back open without him realizing i was rather freaking out over the fact that i closed it as if we didnthave enough sexual accusations under our belts i took a breath and stepped away from the door as james lifted his head to look at me do you he asked again no i said quickly rushing over bed and awkwardly sitting down on the very edge of it i don t honestly then he went into a long explanation over his last new year eve and the drunken state he had found himself in and the first time he had almost lost jocelyn and sirius antics and remus being missing once again softly he asked me what i had done the previous new year eve and without the faintest trace of a smile i simply told him i had been at hogwarts doing homework and drinking stale butterbeer from hogsmeade when the clock chimed it didntseem that pathetic a year ago but actually saying it made me want to bury my head away somewhere abc probably twenty minutes had efficiently passed since i had first found him at the bedroom door and since then i had taken to sprawling out sideways next to him on the bed we spoke in quiet voices of our parents his unconditional love for his and my resentment for mine siblings friends or lack there of we just really talked for the first time in ages and it felt like a weight off my shoulders guilt being extracted from my veins i did not believe james didntwant to be friends with the other three anymore just based on the way he spoke of them he wouldntgo as far as admitting he loved them like brothers or anything like that but it something i just could tell he wouldntlook at me when he talked of them and he didntoffer me heartfelt sympathy when i spoke of jada and the other girls in my year he said in a know it all tone that i was brave naturally or i would ve fell apart long before now and well i believed him when conversation dwindled off into a brief silence and all i did to ease it was yawn hugely james turned his head to look at me and grinned you know what i wish right now evans he asked casually though the smirk over his lips was one i and hundreds of other had seen many times entirely full of mischief what that i asked turning onto my side and propping my head up with my elbow that you were wearing that dress right now he motioned lazily to the sapphire blue heap on the floor because i had a lovely view of your d colletage i was completely unsure of how to react and so for a moment i chose to just gape at him with raised eyebrows wondering if he was going to take the comment back but when his grin widened i gasped and gave him a swat over the arm that left him gasping for air through his laughter rather annoyed by this i hit him again and when he laughed louder i hit him once more by this point he was sliding from the bed and sinking to the floor clutching at his stomach i couldnthelp but ponder whether laughter helped build the wonderful muscles of it and trying to apologize when he spluttered out his apology i nodded satisfied he leaned himself against the bed bending his legs up and draping one arm over his knees from where i sat on the edge of the bed all i could see was the top of his messy haired head so i sat on the floor next to him crossing my legs and resting my hands in my lap the silence was heavy like we were quite accustom to and in this moment there was everything there was love and resentment happiness and anger compliments hidden amongst comments of cleavage there was lightness and darkness guilt and integrity there was a girl and there was a boy a girl who was being pulled apart at the seams and all she really needed all i really needed was for someone to mend her up and hold her close and watch the world fall apart with her a boy who was really a man and who was trying so desperately to hang onto something that was falling apart the girl and that boy that man was just trying to find a life of his own amongst pureblood pride and just then i couldntreally see how willing james was to mend that girl abc despite the warm if not slightly eerie glow from the oil lamp there was a dark creeping between us engulfing us slowly yet surely and spreading from our eyes throughout our whole bodies he seemed darker in the dim light he had been so clean shaven earlier yet now there was some damned stubble scattered over his chin and face offering him the look of a permanent shadow i felt darker somehow perhaps the bed giving a slight shade to the floor we sat on or my air dried curls forcing themselves into my face concealing the side of it from james it was the night challenging us or warning us or offering us a blanket from one another invasive look it was the night we often found ourselves in waiting for something to happen something to determine the path we were meant to go down together or alone we did our best at night anxiety and exhaustion forcing us to be honest and genuine and nothing but who we were i wasntsure though whether he was trying to diminish that suffocating darkness or encourage it as he spoke slowly and gently but with a raw passion that i had mistook for something unidentifiable but angry you he muttered to me yet staring off in another direction i shifted my hair from my face and turned sideways to look at him as he seemed to fight with the words he was already saying you seem to thrive a thrill shot through my body as said the word and i sat up a bit straighter on being broken maybe it didntmake a lot of sense as i stared at him with a frown and maybe the look on his face was apolegetic as he finally met my eyes maybe his words were meant to be harsh or maybe they werentthought through well enough but they were like a cold wind suddenly on my skin tantilizing it refreshing it though not damaging it they registered and i did not know how to take them except for in stride i swallowed them whole didntdwell on them much because when the time came i was sure to cry instead i stared at him because he was staring at me and his right hand was nearing my neck the gasp of breath i took was inaudible as he lay his hand just there on my neck beneath my ear his hand was warm as warm as the skin he was touching became his eyes were warm and that dark was still around us but it wasnt in us yet i dontthink he realized what he was doing what we were doing or what this could destroy or build i thought hopefully james was leaning closer closer still as i got caught up in my thoughts but then i was right there with him leaning closer closer still towards him him towards me his lips were slightly parted hardly even as he came in so close i could smell everything wonderful about him his eyes shut almost squinted i noticed and then he he stopped it was devastating and cruel for a moment as my stomach dropped out and i fought off the urge to run i realized however that he just couldnt lean any further for if he did all the leaning later on all of the blame could be laid on him so then gratefully and later regretfully i decided to share the blame leaning in the rest of the way parting my lips like his were parted and shutting my eyes lightly and then at nearly half past two as if this was the one thing i had been living for i was kissing james potter abc existentialism on prom night by straylight run abc the only parts of us touching were obviously our lips and where his hand was on my neck we werentclose enough to feel the other heartbeat or close enough to breathe the other in when they breathed out but he was so close it seemed yet only because we had never been close like this before he was only close enough to smell close enough to touch maybe but i didnt dare james smelled of faded cologne and something sweet that i couldntquite place there was a faint smell of smoke on him too as if he had been sitting by a dying fireplace i liked to picture him sitting alone in his dark large living room staring into glowing embers of a once lively fire and maybe just maybe he had been thinking of me and how i was either lively or fading out it was with a quiet gasp from each of us that we pulled away my eyes stayed shut as the impression of soft lips his soft lips didntoffer to leave and i felt his chin bump against my cheek as he put space between us sitting up straight his chin against my cheek gave the strangest yet loveliest sensation due to the stubble on his face and i still wasntaware of anything including the fact that this was james when his hand left my neck and i was forced to pull my eyes open it occured to me that he had the nicest features in the world whether it was because i was dizzy from his kiss or because he truly did i dontknow and he was quite the pretty picture glasses all askew and hair a mess eyes on fire and bottom lip perfectly pouted this was james i decided and of course it was him abc there were no further frenzied kisses nor was there a murmured goodnight there was thankfulness for the dim light of the room and perhaps an air of regret being shared between us both but no words it i noted with a tad bit of frustration always came down to no words i didntknow whether i was flattered or upset over his lack of words for me because when we did talk made up for when we didn t he constantly made up for who he wasn t by being who he was and it perplexed me how that could work out it didn t really he wasnta lot of things he wasnteasy to get along with and he wasntpatient he wasnthappy and he wasntsad he made up for who he wasntby being who he was and whenever i think of that i still go a bit light headed when he left i was relieved when he shut the door i stood up unsure for a moment and then threw myself down onto the bed i breathed slowly cursing myself for swearing i could still smell him and tried not to wonder whether he was still smelling me the scent of shampoo was still embedded in my damp curls and it was just a nice fresh smell that would ve been enticing his senses there were no butterflies soaring in my stomach and no erratic breathing there was me in a large empty bedroom that suited me as well as i thought wryly james did and that wasntvery well at all abc waking up the next morning was the hardest thing i had to do i was going to be facing the one boy man james who could make me miserable yet intoxicated at the same time he was going to be there and we were going to be spending one last day inavoidably together before we got on the train to hogwarts the evening of the 2nd of january arriving early on the 3rd and resuming classes on the 4th one last day free of packing or anything else to distract us from each other it was 10 30 in the morning and my head felt rather heavy as if a headache had just passed but i was grinning as i pulled my hair into a loose ponytail the morning was grey and cold i slipped a pair of socks onto my feet before leaving the bedroom for an even colder hallway sun seemed to be missing from the morning or at least any strength to the sun was missing as all that filtered through the windows was soft grey light it was easy for my eyes to adjust to and i hummed quietly to myself as i wandered down the stairs then down to the mr and mrs floor and eventually into the entrance hall i didnthear anyone in the kitchen the living room and den both void of anyone as well curious i found myself standing outside of mr potter study just off the living room listening intently for any sign of life there when i heard rushed voices i stuck my head into the room spotting mr potter talking to a head in his fireplace the man had a grey mustache and was slightly balding though looked rather set and determined his voice was deep and gruff and jude was nodding furiously at whatever the head was saying we should have known something like this was going to happen jude shook his head interrupting the man not enough preparing not enough warning the prophet will have a field day before i could hear just what the prophet would be having a field day with a hand on my shoulder caused me to jump and then i clasped a hand over my mouth so jude wouldnthear me gasp it just felt like something not to intrude on and the look on james face confirmed that for me abc he dragged me out through the living room into the hallway without saying a word when i pulled my arm from his grip he stopped walking and turned to face me folding his arms no emotion nothing really was etched over his face as he looked at me though i wasntreally bothered by this as i was too interested in the fact he was wearing dark blue wizard robes his thick hair was still wet from an obviously recent shower and he had seemed to have combed it down the best he could there was something about him that i didntsee often or at all as he stood to his full height looking down at me as if he were about to discipline me then it hit me something was evidently going on james potter was afterall the son of a ministry employee he was a ministry boy through and through we ve got to leave for a bit he said quietly casting a glance towards the kitchen where i was sure his mum now was all day maybe would you stay here with lexi what going on james but he was shaking his head before i even finished the question a lot he said pointedly and he wasntgoing to elaborate dad got to go in anyway and mum decided we d go and help however we can he was being vague and it didnthelp my curiousity at all i just raised my eyebrows staring at him expectantly thanks lily you re the best he said without a reply from me and his voice was dry as void of emotion as his face was he pushed by me into the kitchen and within five minutes three out of the four potter were gone abc i ate breakfast alone at the kitchen table with not even the morning prophet to console me but then again i was a big girl and didntneed consoling just because i didnthave him there by my side why couldnti just enjoy a moment alone bitterly i realized i was becoming dependent i didntknow when it happened but i did know why and it disgusted me really because i was so utterly caught up in james potter and his world that i couldntquite tell where the lines were drawn where our lives separated and i had my own i couldntrecall the last time i had felt abandonned simply because i was forced to spend a few hours on my own likely when i was a child and had that need for someone to be with me to entertain me and what not but i learned to appreciate time spent on your own without being forced to put up with people you do not want to be around anyway i supposed that was the difference i didntcrave that alone time that time spent in my own thoughts anymore because i had found the one person perhaps in the whole world who i wanted to be around even if i was angry with him even if i wanted to smack him for being so hard hearted and moody and vague i wanted to spend every waking moment with james potter and that realization startled me so badly that i choked on the toast i was eating that when lexi presented herself her mass of curls a decided mess and her hand covering her mouth in a terrible yawn she laughed at my choking and i didntoffer another thought to james throughout the whole day abc the morning was devoted to getting the youngest potter breakfast and answering her questions about me being a muggle she told me that she thought muggle boys were cuter i laughed and i didntnotice at the time but maybe the reason my thoughts didntstray to james again throughout the day was because lexi was so much like him and her wonderful sense of humor kept me unbelievably occupied we made cookies and she told me of melly and what a nice girl she was like i needed anymore confirmation on that lexi said that melly always lets her stay up until midnight on new year eve and i was rather shocked in remembering that was just yesterday the potter party was over mere hours ago yet there was no sign a party had even happened there was no sign the holidays had even existed except for in the living room where the undecorated christmas tree still stood it fresh scent lingering in the air did you kiss a boy at midnight lexi asked me as she took bits of cookie dough straight from the bowl and ate it it was asked with such curious innocence that i almost told her everything that had occured between james and i the night before catching myself however a smile on my face i shook my head no it wasntlying really because i did not kiss james at midnight it was after midnight did melly my curiosity wasntas innocent as lexi was my curiosity was just some sort of desperation to compare myself to melly what boy wouldntwant to be kissing her at midnight i thought what with her long sleek hair willowy form and pretty smile hmm lexi muttered looking thoughtful as she scooped more dough from the bowl nope no boys and i was quite satisfied with that abc it was when lexi started to tell me about sirius and ask me about him that i realized adoration of sirius black seemed to be spread wide and far the only people who didntlove him was his own family and wasntthat a cruel twist fate she said that he was kind of like a brother but she didntthink her brother was cute like sirius was i could do nothing but laugh and agree and tell her that i thought very highly of sirius lexi seemed almost sad for a moment and then considered me with those wide blue eyes is james still best friends with him with a smile i nodded but he most best friends with you isnthe she scrunched her nose up sympathetically as i sure i appeared taken aback just blinking down at the already too aware little girl it different with us i told her simply and she seemed to accept it though the look on her face told me different i couldntblame her though and who could i still and always would harbour a soft spot for sirius black and it was much like her own soft spot it was sympathetic to the way he grew up and a bit proud of the way he turned out it was a soft spot that i appreciated from the very beginning because it meant he was never really gone from me he was never really gone from either of us james or me he was always so very there when you needed him and didntneed him to be he was understanding yet irrational he was ridiculously satisfied with himself it seemed and because of that he carried himself with such an ease that you even loved the way he sauntered on by you with a two fingered wave and a hand back through his thick brown hair i wondered if this little girl saved sirius like james was doing to me not so much saving as influencing they were however quite the potter pair what do you think of remus i asked lexi suddenly as we sat on the floor in the living room playing with her new things from christmas she was brushing the hair on the doll i had given her and she looked down at the doll before looking up at me remus is like an old man when i frowned she shrugged he knows a lot and is kinda sad she paused again handing the doll to me and an outfit that came with her will you change her please she asked all pretty and polite i did so and she talked of remus while i was but he nice and he cares a lot even about you i bet i considered asking her what she thought of peter but changed my mind i didntfeel right prodding her for information or something it was just so strange this girl was not five years old i decided shaking my head slightly and handing the doll back to her that was now wearing a pink dress she was too smart too knowing too wise i felt so proud and fond of her for it but this part of me the part of me that recalled my own rushed childhood felt so terrible for her intellectual realizations that soon would likely turn into jaded realizations and before we knew it she d be going to hogwarts too abc 8 o clock p m came and 8 o clock p m went and it was still just lexi and myself in a very empty very large house she seemed more worried than i did though and i wondered just what she knew i was anticipating a visit from sirius or remus or the two of them because that would ve been quite comforting i felt vunerable and revealed with lexi because she could just read into every expression on your face by 9 o clock lexi had changed into her pajamas and asked for a mug of hot cocoa looking quite worn having spent all day eating cookies and giggling madly but in between talking of three boys who all cared for her like the younger sister she was i had turned lights on and lit lamps as we walked through the house going to her bedroom the night just seemed to engulf this house too quickly lexi got underneath the covers smiling at me before asking me to tell her a story or sing her to sleep so i laid next to her on the bed above the covers and played with her pretty hair while humming a melody that just seemed to haunt me murmuring words here and there wondering whether this was an actual song or just one i had invented at some point it seemed to work however because she began to blink frequently and soon her eyes werentopening as quickly after she shut them and eventually they were fluttering completely shut her breathing got slightly louder as her mouth fell open and sleep had clearly found her the comfort i suddenly found in the sound of her steady breathing was rather wonderful startling but wonderful and i just looked down at her with curiously slanted eyes and a smile with unwavering fondness for the smallest potter i was watching the doorway expectantly when he arrived at it knocking quietly on the door though it was half open relief flooded through me instantly though reluctantly him standing there now decked out in a pair of jeans and a nicely fitted dark t shirt dug up everything i had spent all day not thinking of specifically one certain thing that was being avoided with ease oh she asleep james muttered passing through into the room and focusing on the blue eyed blonde he bent down placing a quick kiss onto her forehead and then a heavy sighed passed through his lips there was something about him that i had never ever seen before it just radiated around him and i felt quite out of place or perhaps whatever was radiating around him was what was out of place something paternal he was watching his little sister with eyes of a parent and it was beyond his years yet oddly it fitted him sorry we took so long he said offering me a brief glance and then leaving the room before i even had a chance to sit up abc i didntlay there too much longer for mr and mrs potter voices were fast approaching meaning they were fast approaching and dealing with them was some sort of ability that i didntseem to possess i slipped from the room and then by their bedroom where they were stood decked out in their night clothes and down the stairs without being noticed feeling groggy myself and yawning silently i made my way into the kitchen which never failed in being blindingly bright with all of it white d cor he was standing there leaning against the counter with a mug in his hand he seemed like a dark jagged cut out standing against the white of the kitchen with his jeans that were considerably faded and considerably snug his matted down hair didntlast as it was sticking up worse than i had seen it in awhile and was like a bolt of black clashing with his rather pallid face what re you drinking i asked hating myself for having nothing better to ask standing there as awkward as anything quite the near the door tea he answered simply and i smiled because he was everything a contradiction was made of do you want some james motioned to the kettle that still had steam rising out of it without an answer from me he flicked his wand and a mug appeared on the counter the kettle instantly filling it with the liquid he picked the mug up and with his own still in his hand he walked towards me thrust it into my hands and sat down at the kitchen table he looked awful and weary and circles were forming beneath his eyes and given the early hour it was rather strange but everything about that day was rather strange from james and dani going to help at the ministry to the lack of built in babysitter melly i cleared my throat gently taking a sip of the tea watching him carefully so where were you guys all day i asked moving across the kitchen to stand closer to the table his lidded eyes were staring into the mug and when i spoke his stare did not falter for a moment it was as if he hadntheard me through his intent staring but then he looked up at me not bothering to hide a frown the ministry he said simply and i nodded though i already caught on to that earlier it my was turn to lower my eyes to the mug which i held in both of my hands reveling in the warmth penetrating through it as it was the only warm aspect about this kitchen he was with a smug almost daring expression on his face waiting for me to speak again but i didntwant to because any further questions i asked he would somehow dodge and i d end up knowing less than when we started he would somehow make me feel guilty for wanting to know what was going on and that was one aspect of james potter that was most certainly not a positive attraction he just had so much power without anybody really realizing it over people one single expression one word or one scoff and he d instantly have you regretting whatever it was you said or did when it came to being manipulative james was more likely to be accused of it over sirius he was an only child for so many years and had a pair of parents who we were so fascinated by their little boy that they allowed him to pull people in so close and then make them squirm under his gaze one boy shouldntbe aware of how easily people give into his expectations and demands it might give him an inflated head dontyou think it just fair that i know what going on i asked him quietly helplessly there nothing going on james told me with a casual shrug but the tension in the way he was sitting told me otherwise he was almost rigid as if he were waiting for the end of the world to come as if the sky was about to light up with balls of fire and he d have to deal with screams from unsuspecting people his jaw clenched his shoulders tensed up he could ve been fighting the urge or the need to run from what i really didntknow nothing at all the grip he had on his mug still held in one hand was a white knuckled sort of grip and for a moment i swore he was grinding his teeth i let out some pathetic sound somewhere between a gasp or a sob or a shout and his hazel eyes met my green ones as i wondered if the two colours were ever to merge which colour would stand victorious which one would do the overpowering when he dropped his stare back down to his hands with a little less hostility i decided with a sudden surge of pride that as much as he tried to hate me he just never ever would be able to it made me feel better yet slightly unwanted what with him trying in the first place what the hell is wrong with you i asked and for a moment i thought it was angrily but in a second i realized it was as helplessly as the last time i spoke he had drained his mug propping his elbows up on the table and his head sunk into his hands curling his fingers into his hair i panicked for a moment seeing his eyes squeeze shut and i was worried he was going to start crying i felt revolted for a second until i saw his cheeks were dry of any tears and then silently berated myself for being so horribly judgemental i didntknow why i couldntdeal with a boy crying but i just couldnt james potter wasntone to cry i decided seeing his eyes had been squeezed shut more with frustration than sadness he winced gingerly touching his forehead and cursed loudly as his hands slipped from his hair and his head banged inelegantly against the table james i said soothingly reaching a hand out as he pulled his head up and he didntseem to have the energy to glare me down any longer headache he murmured his eyes shut as i took my wand out terrible one i wracked my brain for anything that could ease it and muttered a couple of spells looking at him with nothing but pity on my face it was so much more than a headache little did i know any better i asked close to a whisper and he nodded though i was wasntsure he meant it he stood up pulling himself together it seemed gathering his mug in one hand and taking my half empty mug from in front of me there was a sullen handsomeness to him as he poured the rest of my tea down the sink and rinsed his own mug out it was all over his face and in the fluid way he moved for some reason my heart broke for him and if he wasntone to cry then i was going to cry for him because something had happened and just wasntabout to let me know he was so loving but so moody and i just couldntget a firm hold on anything that he was what happened today i asked one last time and when silence was my response i stood up and made to leave the kitchen my hand was splayed across the door pushing it just as he said my name lily it was quiet yet that powerful demand was still there what i said pointedly trying to express my frustration for him but finding i couldnttonight as i turned around to face him his back was to me staring out the window over the sink each one of his hands grasping the counter on either side of him could you come here please his tone had changed so dramatically that the steps i took towards him were immediate he turned around and i wasntsure what i was expecting but when he pulled me into his arms it was the only thing i could have expected james held onto me tightly leaning himself against the edge of the counter his arms wrapped around my lower back and his face buried into my hair he didntsay another word as much as i wished he would i hesitated for only a moment before wrapping my arms back around him not as tightly as his were because he was the one holding me and i think he needed reassurance of that when he shifted his arms after countless minutes of just beind held by him and i heard him swallow hard it was apparent to me that some part of james world had already come to an end tonight and it wasntany of my business just then who had made his world come to an end because when james did something like this you held on for dear life litterally or metaphorically because it was a rare thing abc rescued by jack mannequin abc done i hope you like it it so focused on lily and james i know but the next chapter is unbelievably eventful there are reviewer responses and lyrics on my livejournal i believe the link works now love chapter 19 bruised and burned abc vindicated by dashboard confessional abc somehow though i wasntsure how it happened or just how fast it happened i was gone from james suddenly offputting embrace and found myself in the dark living room i turned the television on staring at it large screen at the holiday rerun over every channel it pissed me off that they had a television that they had electricity that they thought they could have the best of both worlds it didntseem right to me and i didntunderstand why then all of this was occuring to me but it was and i looked around the room with a rather upturned nose muggles couldntfix some things with a wave of a wand and couldnttravel places simply by concentrating real hard on it muggles had cars for that nobody in this magical world deserved to have those muggle things why did their lives need to be made easier sometimes i found myself in hysterics just trying to figure out where it was i truly belonged the wizarding world thought muggles were so naive and so unaccomplished and i was a muggle i was born to ordinary people i was raised an ordinary child with too many freckles i spoke an ordinary language and i loved ordinary things and in some people eyes i was lesser because of that i was born into that world and to so many people i wasnt worthy to be in this magical haven i was a mudblood i was a muggle i when the anger that had quickly started coursing through my veins reached it peak and i felt like screaming i realized the one thing i came to terms with the one thing that i should have almost seven years ago you re a witch lily i told myself warm realization flooding through me and replacing the anger i was just as worthy as the next pureblood a bit of the bitterness that had been hanging around me since i got here in this upscale home with these basic strangers well it seemed to ease away as i leaned my head back against the couch and considered things mrs potter and hating me did she really hate me she acted hostile towards me and like she would prefer me not to be there but maybe it was me maybe that awkward unwelcome feeling i got was taking a toll on me and that toll was obvious to her i was uncomfortable around her and bitter about so many things that i was just beginning to realize maybe it was all over my face maybe the way i looked at her too large house was obvious to her and maybe it was because of the way i was acting so desperate and needy shy and clingy that she thought i wasntgood enough for her son and now it seemed to matter what she thought of me within the last day things changed drastically things had changed so drastically that i wasnteven caught up with them yet unsure of whether or not i wanted to be caught up with it because something had happened and i had been left with lexi for hours and nobody was speaking and there were no newspapers anywhere but that was just the beginning sirius and remus were decidedly absent and i didntbelieve the story of them going to visit some of remus relatives james didnteven know if he liked his friends anymore he was so hell bent on changing so hell bent on becoming what i needed and assuring me i had somehow become what he had needed and somewhere in the back of my mind more preoccupied by james and the maruaders i remembered that we had kissed it was a distant sort of fuzzy memory where you cantremember everything with too much detail yet you just cant forget and as i pushed the thought from my mind just like every other time it had entered it i remembered it had just been last night that we kissed but the fact of the matter was james still needed those friends he still liked those friends he still thrived off those friends just like i thrived on being broken i stopped thinking stopped moving my hands around impulsively and nervously and just let it flow coldly throughout me when i had pushed myself from his arms left him standing there in that kitchen i had not known why his arms so tight around me had become so suffocating and uncomfortable but now it all made sense it was all tied in to the night before not so much the forgotten kiss the mistake the regret whatever it was it was him telling me that i thrived on being broken it hit me while i was standing there in his arms pressed so close i could feel the deliberately slow rhythm of his breathing and i had hated it i hated how i felt when i remembered it it didntfeel like that the night before it didntfeel so cold so real wrapped up in his warm arms though it felt like i was being drowned slowly in a pool of icy cold water when i realized this was the boy who said it i was being hugged by a contradiction so warm and so sure that i was broken that i thrived on it it was as said before offputting and i had really without thinking left him then james was walking into the living room and towards me faster than i could have prepared for i had no time to leave because if i did have time to leave i would have left i was a coward i was a child i was a mudblood i was a witch and i suddenly wanted to avoid confrontation at all costs before i could tell him i wasnttalking tonight before i could make a run for it he looked at me he stared me down in a way that only he could and i realized i wasntgoing anywhere right now i wasntgoing to say anything right now abc the light from the televison washed over his body and made his face stand out vividly from the swallowing dark of the rest of the living room his hands were at his sides in loose fists and his jaw was clenched and he seemed to be having some internal conflict i was waiting for his deep voice all serious and wicked to tell me just where i could go if i wasntgoing to understand his need to not confide in me it never came however as his mouth fell open in a sigh and his hands went to his hair pulling it back from his eyes when i saw the look on his face saw the distress the desperation i realized he was as much of a coward as i was tonight i pressed my lips together watching him closely as he moved towards me again he sat on the floor instead of next to me on the couch and i found him leaning against my legs not just gently leaning there in an affectionate sort of way only being done because there was a need for some sort of contact no he leaned back against me as if he was throwing all of his weight back and he bent his legs up draping his arms over them burying his face away near his knees there were long drawn out moments of complete silence where neither of us moved and i wasntsure either of us even breathed the room was dark the night was dark the large uncurtained window behind us offered nothing but a far off view of a few stars and the only source of light was the blueish altering glow coming from the television it contorted our features a bit made my skin seem paler and as i stared at the back of his head his hair appeared darker the best way to describe the light of the room was dark blue a dark tainted blue the atmosphere in the room no the atmosphere between us was practically unbearable it wasntas heavy as the night before not heavy enough to be making our breathing heavy and hard it was too light it was thin and vague it was like we were trekking up a steep mountain and the air around us was thinning until we were left gasping for one gulp of air one gulp of salvation we were starving for salvation abc dark blue by jack mannequin abc i wanted to know if he believed in god i wanted to know if he was going to be an auror if he was going to follow in his father footsteps i wanted to know if he believed in monogamy or if the idea of a heated affair excited him i wanted to know his deepest fear and his greatest accomplishment i wanted to touch his hair and taste his bitterness i wanted to know everything about him ask him every question i could think of i wanted him to tell me more about his mum and peter pettigrew i wanted him to tell me what it felt like to be loved so unconditionally there was something about him sitting there like he was with the weight of the world on his broad shoulders the weight of a smashed torn bruised world there was something about the weariness etched beneath his eyes and the awareness surrounding him that made me want to thrive on that vunerability instead of something broken there was no way to sate that flaming curiousity coursing through every inch of my exhausted body there were no words to be spoken none that would ease the peculiar state we had found ourselves in i wanted to shout at him and tell him i was angry and selfish and flawed i wanted to tell him that i wasnta person anyone would want to be around i wanted to assure him i was meant to be alone and that i would be fine alone i wanted to make him mean nothing to me i found myself unable to do or say any of those things and the one thing i did find myself do was surprising random unnecessary james had with a sigh heavy enough to break him in two leaned his head back to rest against my legs that were neatly tucked against the couch pressed together as if i had set out to do only this i reached my right hand to his head and combed it gently through his hair he adjusted himself against my legs pressing against them in a way that made me almost automatically part them in order for him to be comfortable and in order for me to reach his hair better it felt like i had done this a hundred times before like we had found ourselves in this exact position again and again the feel of his hair between my fingertips however was the most exotic yet enticing thing i had ever experienced the unruly strands were soft and his hair was thick the smell of his somehow manly shampoo was embedded deep within the mass of jet black hair it stuck up easily even with the gentlest of strokes and i had to wonder who was enjoying it more the sound he made though when i tugged gently on his hair causing it to stick up horribly was the single most desirable sound i had ever heard i brought my other hand into his hair and threaded all ten of my fingers through it tugging on it once again and the same sound somewhere between a soothed sigh and a groan escaped his lips i found myself swallowing hard the events of that day becoming cloudy in my mind somewhere in the back of my mind i realized that both potter children james and lexi liked having their hair played with not so much liked as they were bloody well addicted to it james reaction was a bit more than lexi s as she just seemed to fall straight to sleep once you started playing with her hair it was her sweet little weakness james it was his sweet little turn on my cheeks burned scarlet as the thought ran through my head and i pulled my hands out of his hair trying to catch my breath having his head resting where it was didnthelp matters and the urge to snog him senseless ran through my body i wanted to kiss him it the only thing i decided i wanted to do for the rest of my life i wanted to hear him make that sound a thousand times over and i didntwant to ever talk to him again i didntneed to all i needed to do was kiss him as unresolved as things lay as horribly tainted as things seemed i wanted needed to kiss that boy again abc a minute or two after i had took my hands from his hair he had got up from the floor and sat down next to me on the couch i was barely aware of this until i found myself abruptly turning my whole body to face him crossed my legs and stared at my hands i looked up at him cautiously and saw the glower on his face the frown that rested over his features seemed to sit there with ease and a crease came down between his eyebrows increasing the dark look his lips were set in a bit of a pout though his jaw was clenched and his eyes were readily meeting my own stare when i looked away from him back to my folded hands resting in my lap he shifted next to me possibly moving closer and then each of his hands were gripping my face forcing my gaze back to his i knew my eyes were wide as i stared at him looking so angry and sullen and positively bruised there were words offering to spill from his lips possibly words that would offer each of us that forgotten salvation or maybe they were words that would involve the happenings of the passed day or perhaps they were words telling me how much i meant to him but it was all a bit of hopeful thinking on my part that hope that sparked in me when i thought he was going to say something offering closure of the night before or today or of damaging kisses was instantly extinguished when his tongue darted out to wet his dry lips and he began to lean forward he was going to kiss me he going to kiss you james was going to kiss me james was going to kiss you the thought was there running through my mind as he leaned in quickly quicker than the night before he was determined and irrational and he was going to kiss me i had wanted it hadnti i had needed it hadnti that need that want slipped away just as quick as he was leaning we couldn t i wouldn t actually not with the unfinished business with the day that had just passed we can t i leaned my head back away from him trying to have his hands fall away from my face but he just gripped me tighter refusing to let me back down the words seemed to burn him like his eyes so often burned me maybe it wasntjust me denying him a kiss maybe anything i said after leaving him in the kitchen like i had maybe everything i said was going to burn him from here on out maybe that agressive no passionate maybe that passionate look was burned on his face now it was a startling look his eyes sharp and focused dancing with everything he saw passion he was passion james potter was passion whereas sirius black had passion we can t the pitch of his voice high and cracking an amused tone settling in it though it was a sad kind of amusement i dont fucking care if we can t his eyes sparked lit and burned just like everything else was right now then something leaked out he spoke so rawly that i knew it was based on whatever had happened that day the world was his enemy right now he was fighting to be it fighting to beat time because something had happened the world not going to wait for us james voice was still breaking on certain words it doesntcare about when we can or can t lily it just going to fucking pass us by i swore i was crying as he tucked my hair behind both of my ears his fingers grazing my earlobes as he did so he slid his hands from my cheeks down to the sides of my neck and i didntknow if he was pulling me towards him or if i was leaning i swore i was crying the emotions running through me would ve normally provoked tears but i didntfeel any my cheeks were burning and my eyes stung and there was a lump in my throat refusing to be swallowed releasing a sob would ve felt so amazing right now and i never ever wanted to cry so terribly before in my life than i did then it was just the beginning though just as i felt a sob creeping up my throat james spoke once again in a soft murmur ladies first he said and the meaning of what he meant was lost on me until i found myself closing the space between us and the threatening sob was suddenly swallowed whole as our lips met for the second time ever it wasntlike the first time in any way it wasntinnocent and it wasntsoft and it wasntcareless i had only been kissed a minimal amount but it was unlike any of the previous kisses his mouth had somehow opened against mine within seconds of our lips meeting and i was forced to consider my next move sitting there pressed against him but then my lips were parted too and i was pretty sure he had done it i didntknow i couldntthink there was the strangest yet warmest tingling sensation as the kiss deepened slightly it wasntas deep as it was rough hurried frenzied and hard his mouth could ve been bruising my own and i was thankful of it i could barely breathe after what had to have been a whole minute of james potter lips on my own he pulled back and i sucked in some air and then he was bumping his lips back against my own not really kissing them just roughly grazing them i felt so tormented but exhilirated i finally felt well kissed after we pulled away for the last time i finally felt like i knew what i was doing pulling away was more depressing than kissing him when i shouldn t ve been was it was damaging to stare into that face and those eyes and see his lips so red and knowing it was because of me he was breathing hard though he hid it well and the only way i knew was when his chest pressed tighter against me i took unsteady breaths as he continued hanging onto me one hand at the back of my neck and the other stroking up and down my arm as if to calm me sooth me relieve some tension really shouldn t ve i been doing that for him i alright i muttered as i felt his forehead touch against my own i alright i alright i alright you re lying he whispered back though he didntseem to really care i hated him i needed him he was passion we could lily he began we did then he untangled himself from me and went to bed at quarter to ten on a broken night abc i dontremember what time it was when i went to bed though i thought it to be before eleven i dontremember walking through the house making my way to what was my temporary bedroom i dontremember having any thoughts after james left the room i hardly remember breathing i do remember though that just as i was pushing open the bedroom door i saw him sitting there at the end of the hallway staring out that window i do remember feeling like going to sit with him i do remember feeling my heart swell with something indescriable as i turned my back on him and immediately sank into a well needed sleep it was quarter to eight when i got up that morning i had showered quickly without bothering to check the time and dressed in a pair of comfortable jeans along with a dark navy sweater my hair still wet and droplets of water clinging to the fabric of the sweater i made my way downstairs humming softly and swinging my arms back and forth the fact i couldntsmell any breakfast cooking or any clatter indicating mr and mrs potter were up prompted me to check the nearest clock for the time seven forty five i had been awake since at least quarter after seven then i stood there in the hallway wondering whether i should just go back to bed when i peered into the living room and saw what should have been more surprising to me than the early time james and sirius james sitting on the couch sirius sitting in an armchair he had pulled up to the other side of the coffee table playing a game of chess the old fashioned muggle way it was quieter i supposed than the raucous way of wizard chess neither of them had to mutter a word and maybe that was the reason for their choosing to play the muggle way maybe speaking was just beyond all of us now neither of them looked up as i entered the room tugging the sleeves of my sweater down over my hands in an impulsive sort of way until james had completed a particularly nerve wracking move then sirius looked over at me james gaze following a moment after good morning up awful early sirius commented as i walked around his armchair to situate myself on the couch next to james could say the same for you i told him stifling a yawn that washed over me as soon as i entered the room i curled my legs up next to me on the couch and put one of my hands between my legs to warm it the other hand draped over the arm of the couch as i watched james leisurely he moved again and then sirius was left to concentrate hard on his next one james took advantage of sirius lack of attention for us at the moment and looked over to me it a comfort issue he told me in a quiet voice that could have sung me back to sleep motioning to the chess board i understood what he meant chess was his comfort chess with his best friend was his comfort knowing it was still there to play knowing that after all that had gone on whatever had gone on they could still find themselves playing a game of chess at ridiculous hours and still sit in a comfortable silence together for a brief moment when i saw the look on sirius face as he watched james make a play i hated james for ever doubting him for ever doubting any of them because no matter what he told me no matter how he tried to say it was about me lately it wasnttrue it just wasn t i wasntthe best friend who had come over at an ungodly hour just to sit in silence and play a normal game of chess i didntknow what had happened i didntknow near enough about him sirius was here now and sirius was james best friend abc i sat and watched them play for about a half an hour before mr and mrs potter got up they had played in complete silence sirius only speaking once more to reply to my question of remus whereabouts he answered with an unconvincing reason that was growing popular with remus he wasntfeeling well when the game didntshow any sign of letting up i excused myself needlessly because they ignored it as they had ignored every other attempt i had made at conversation and went to help mrs potter with breakfast she was grateful but only because mr potter had to be into work in ten minutes and we had to get something whipped up soon i made him an omlet while he munched on some toast and mrs potter rushed around gathering papers and long pieces of parchment stuffing them into the briefcase he had laying on the table next to him mr potter was standing from the table while still chewing his last bite of omlet and gathering his briefcase into his hands looking wearily at mrs potter and then thanking me for the breakfast sensing the tension suddenly between them as he prepared to leave for work i told dani i had something to return to melly and would be back in a few minutes it felt like as good of a time as any to return the dress and as the kitchen door swung shut behind me i saw mrs potter wrapping her arms around her husband muttering frantically brushing off the sinking feeling in my stomach i went to my room and prepared melly dress i used a couple of charms on it to erase the distress in the fabric and then folded it into an extra gift bag that was lying on the floor the sinking becoming harder to ignore and now paired with a flitting feeling of hyperventilation i decided to come to terms with something other than returning melly dress i had to pack this morning we were to take the train back to hogwarts this evening and with every minute that passed i felt worse and worse about leaving i thought about it as i left the house embracing the cold morning easily as i single handedly buttoned my coat up i thought about how i was so excited to get here to the potter then i was brought down so quickly and i wanted nothing more than to leave and go back to hogwarts and i wondered when it had changed as far as i had known before that morning i had still wanted to leave as soon as possible but sometime caught up in the lies and the holidays and the parties and the confrontations i had changed my mind i had grown fond of almost everything about the potter s and the house even mrs potter was growing on me even if she tried not to like me i couldnthate a woman who i saw so much of in james the street was empty and the morning was pale frost crept out of the cracks in the pavement and vapour floated through the air at the slight change in temperature the frozen ground and the sun trying to warm things up smoke rolled out of chimneys and christmas lights still decorated the outside of people homes the morning was lovely on this picturesque street that muggles and magical alike called home and behind me loomed the ultimate house on the street the potter house likely the largest and most beautiful home stood tall there on the street and i couldnthelp but turn around to look at it when i nearing the middle of the street my bag dropped out of my hand and i stumbled to pick it up without pulling my eyes off of the house covered in weak sunlight and shadows the breath had left me for a moment as an overwhelmingly foreboding feeling hit me i tried to turn my back on it the house and the feeling but i realized just what was so foreboding about that moment as i looked back over my shoulder i felt like i d never see that house again after we left today not the same again something was so momentarily chilling about it offputting and for once it wasntjust the thought of james and me abc fix you by coldplay abc i hurried the rest of the way across the street and up the drive to melly house i knocked on the door and rang the doorbell but when there was no response i tried the doorknob it was unlocked so i ventured inside the warm house calling melly name in a sing song her parents were obviously not home and by the looks of it either was she as i went to set the bag down to just leave it for her i heard a soft thud and melly voice come from upstairs it sounded as if she were laughing so i went up the staircase and made my way down the hallway towards her room melly i began coming to stand in front of her bedroom door that was already halfway open i pushed it the rest of the way looking down at the bag to check it hadntfallen out or something of the sort and when i looked back up into the room i dropped the bag for the second time that morning oh oh oh i sorry i was just returning the dress i didntthink i didntknow uh ohkay i ll see you i muttered in hurry leaving the bag where it was the doorway of the bedroom and turned to rush away i had stared for about two seconds while the two of them froze and stared at me laying on top of melly the sweet sister like neighbour girl was none other than remus lupin she had her leg hooked around his waist and he looked quite scantily clad but i didntstay to find out if he was or where hands were or anything of the sort i was halfway down the hall blushing with embarrassment of having caught them and hardly able to imagine how they must feel when i heard remus tell melly he had to explain it i began running down the stairs hearing him behind me i turned to look at him and saw he was fumbling to fasten his jeans up i was already out the front door when he caught me though in a less compromising position lily wait he grabbed onto my arm and held me in place and i turned to look at him though i quickly looked away again come out here remus stepped outside onto the doorstep once deciding i wasntgoing to run again and shut the door he took advantage of this moment of completely awkward silence and fastened the jeans he hadntsucceeded with a moment before they were faded had becoming holes in the knees and were clinging tightly to his hips he stood barefoot and shirtless and i noticed that he was quite scrawnier than james remus ribs were faintly visible though his skin was tanned but battered scars lined his chest though most werentnoticable a few ran deep and there were some obvious recent wounds his chest was rather weak looking at first glance paired with the visible ribcage but was actually a bit toned sprigs of sandy coloured hair covered one place and the rest was smooth skin save for some hair travelling down his stomach below his jeans his stomach could have rippled with muscles if he didntgive off the impression of someone who had far too much energy and activity but ate far too little to even it out he scowled at me when he caught me glancing partially satisfied with the sight before me and proceeded to dig in the back pocket of his jeans a moment later he pulled out his wand and a pack of cigarettes he put one in his mouth lit it with his wand and shoved both things back into his pocket what the hell is going on i asked finally though i didntneed an explanation of the situation i d just walked in on i was angry for some reason with the discovery of them he was supposed to be sick while two of his best friends played a boring yet comforting game of chess or else he would have been there participating in that boring comfort any way he could he was supposed to be looking moody and pained like they did and not over here on top of the neighbour girl the thing that angered me i think was the fact that no one else knew if they had known if sirius and james had known they wouldn t ve tried to explain melly off as a sister like figure to all of them if they acutally had a relationship it would have come out before this and certainly not in this way here i took my heavy coat off as he sucked on the cigarette and thrust it into his hands i wore a sweater beneath it anyway and one glance across his chest told me that he wasnthandling the below freezing morning too well reluctantly he accepted it and forced it on the sleeves came up to almost his elbows and the fabric strained across his shoulders but at least it was something you re a damned hypocrite i told him and he quirked his eyebrows at me listen i didntcome down here to be bitched at by you about something you cantpossibly understand i think i understand perfectly you told sirius you were sick and then came over here to get some before you had to go back to hogwarts the scowl over his handsome yet tired and rugged features deepened and he blew smoke directly in my face if you d let me explain it then perhaps you d stop bloody well overreacting you do it with everything though dontyou you make little things out to be so much more like your and james friendship for example i raised a hand to slap him over the face but he was too quick for that so instead i slapped my hand against his bare chest shut up i told him and his scowl lifted instantly replaced by amused curiousity you re a hypocrite you tell me not to lie and to stand up to people and to prove myself you tell me that i not trusted and that i not going to be trusted but you lie and you deceive and you just fucking instigate things you ve got these three apparently amazing friendships with three different people yet your head is too far up your ass to see that they re all based on lies you and me remus we re in the same boat now you re doing exactly what i did kissing someone your friends know well behind their back s i just i hate you he outright laughed when i said that and smirked at me the cigarette hanging from his mouth you re being awfully dramatic today what going on i wanted to slap that smirk right off his face i wanted to reveal him for the lying bastard he really was i wanted to i didntwant to break down i didntwant to start rambling on to him trying not to cry i didntwant to admit that anything was wrong that this boy touched a nerve with me i didntwant him to know anything yet there i was somehow i was sitting on the step while he stood over me smoking like the chimney he wished he was listening intently whatever his actual intentions afterwards would be something happened i know something happened i know that he hiding things from me but what business do i have being upset when i hid things from him but i know this is so much more important than petty kissing and speaking of petty kissing god sirius and i are so so finished we hadnteven started but here we are friends i told you i wanted something with him yet all i did was push him further from the picture and james he such an idiot such a passionate bloody idiot and oh my god what ve i done with that we kissed i mean what going to happen what the hell is going on with everyone and i just am so absolutely kicked out in the cold over it and you re right i do make things out to be more than they actually are and i just completely dontbelong here that and was my last as i wiped furiously at my eyes feeling remus sink down on the step next to me melly and i are friends with benefits i dontlove her we donthave a relationship that anything more than screwing around when i home from school and it nothing to get your knickers in a twist over i guess that you ve got some dirt on me now lily evans i looked up at him tears threatening to spill from my eyes once again and this whole situation was suddenly very strange to me remus lupin my undeclared worst enemy sitting next to me with my coat on a cigarette between his fingers his face unshaven and making some sort of peace between us once again i dontquite know what going on but i can tell you that things arentgoing to get any better he offered a slight inclination of his head and then the cigarette was back in his mouth and silence ensured once more that makes me feel better i told him bowing my head against the chilly breeze remus scoffed and shook his head leaning back on his elbows with the cigarette in his mouth and the ashes on the end of it hanging dangerously from it i watched the ciagrette as he spoke and this twisted part of me could see those ashes falling down onto his bare chest and yet his quick shout of surprised pain wouldntbe enough i could see him burning slowly and his eyes would still be stormy blue i blinked myself harshly from my demented reverie and grabbed the cigarette from his mouth flicking the end and watching the ashes get caught up in the wind it not meant to make you feel better he told me with raised eyebrows as i gave the cigarette back it meant to make you stand up straight you know you re not going to be able to back down from conflict forever looking out across the street a shudder ran through my body staring at the potter house where backing down from conflict was a thing cowards did i was a coward i thought decidedly and i wished i could remain that way i a coward though you and the other marauders you re brave i dontknow about in the sense of physically overcoming things little did i know then that remus had overcome one large physical hindrence that also bruised him emotionally but the way you live your lives everyday it with a dash of bravery with a smile he tossed the cigarette down onto the step trodded on it and then kicked it off you re such a lovely liar remus said slowly and the smile still tugging at his lips because you re not a coward these passed few days have been enough to prove that to anyone yes lily including dani he stood and tugged my coat off handing it to me as i stood up as well i ll be over later today to see dani before we go back the humor that lied within his gaze a moment ago was gone and replaced with something desperate yet firm i wonttell sirius about you and james if you donttell them about me and melly he had lowered his voice and cast his eyes around as if someone could overhear i was actually surprised he picked that out of my previous ramblings bastard i muttered throwing my coat on and glaring down at our feet i didntwant to agree to that i didntwant to say yes to that i didntwant to have him go turning back on his word and sirius finding out yet another thing was kept from him and maybe that best friendship that he had with james would suffer further and to the point of breaking i can t i cant trust you remus i said frustrated and staring him straight in the eye right back at you darling he said with the same frustrated vigor i had given to him his were eyes wide and his eyebrows were raised pointedly so what do we do i asked with a sigh as he began to rub his hands up and down his arms nothing i guess we re going to have to let each other decide he smiled and then turned back into the house shutting the door on me without a second glance and for some reason i wasntworried about remus instigating things again maybe because he was warming up to me or maybe because he was worried about me saying something about him and melly but the actual reason was shock on both of our parts shock that james potter was finally something more to me abc who to say by vanessa carlton abc the day wore on much like our lives tended to wear on and i found myself packing sooner than i had wanted to i was sighing too much refusing to look at my head girl badge and wondering why it felt like i had spent a lifetime on holiday at the potter s we spent the day together james sirius remus and myself being fed sweets by mrs potter playing exploding snap and talking rather comfortably for a group of teenagers who without fail found themselves in a conflict with at least one other it was something about knowing that this had been our last christmas holiday away from hogwarts that next year christmas would be spent in our adult lives and there d be no hogwarts express to catch and make things all better melly joined us shortly after 5 o clock and her parents were invited over for supper we had a ridiculously large meal that all of the women helped in preparing and pie for dessert i marvelled at how well remus and melly acted around one another as if they hardly knew one another really though there were some things i couldnthelp but noticing now such as when they sat next to each other no matter what we were doing and how remus hand would disappear under the table for a second or two at at time and i tried not to laugh when remus would meet my stare with a steady glare sirius ate as if it were his last day to do so and the way the three of them were together it just didntchange remus supplied the sarcastic remarks at which sirius glowered at before physically harming him if such comments were directed towards him james reminisced loudly and seemed to feed off the attention that was given to him just for a moment and it was a side of him i wasntused to seeing sirius acted younger or less branded something that just wasntgenuine though everyone seemed to know that they all saw right through his boisterous laughter and well i spent much of the day observing the admirable trio it was shortly after ten o clock when sirius and remus declared they needed to head back to the lupin to retrieve their things they told james and i that they d see us at the train station and both boys hugged mrs potter as a farewell mrs potter told them both to write and the dimply grin on remus face was absolutely priceless they said goodbye to lexi and then mr potter took them into his study so that they could floo that when our farewell started as well when jude came back into the living room he told us to go gather our things and the two of us set off towards our rooms together silently james was looking moody and impulsive as if any minute he d hex something or perhaps he d decide to drop out of his hogwarts and stay home with his family abc the room i had stayed in looked completely bare to me without my things on the floor or on the stands it was just an old fashioned well decorated room that would be empty now i laid there on the bed for a few moments waiting for the lump in my throat to pass and then i lugged my bags from the room even with a charm on them they were awkward to carry over my shoulders though they were much more convenient than bringing my whole trunk james had already gone back downstairs and was just letting go of his mum when i arrived in the entrance hall i set the bags down and immediately had lexi jump into my arms i ll miss you she said her blue eyes wide and sincere oh darling i murmured hugging her to me i ll miss you too i promise i ll see you soon though i turned to face james who was looking at us with a look on his face that was so beyond anything we had shared today i put lexi into his arms and turned to face mrs potter melly and her parents were still there i realized how remus conveniently avoided bidding melly a goodbye before they left and mrs potter was avidly avoiding giving me her attention i just want to thank you again mrs potter i interrupted her quiet conversation with melly mum i really really enjoyed myself best holidays i ve had for awhile and i meant it mrs potter smiled at me and nodded though didntsay anything she gave me a quick hug left me feeling useless once more but only for a moment because i had also grown used to her being the way she was around me it was lovely lily she said and then i was being rushed out of the door by mr potter who had taken the bags to the car and i exchanged a quick goodbye with melly as i walked down the stairs she closed the door as the three of us walked towards the car and the last thing i saw in the doorway was mrs potter watching us intently as we left with her little blue eyed girl in her arms i didnttake my eyes off of the house as i opened the door and climbed into the backseat i didnttake my eyes off of the house as we backed out of the driveway and started down the street i did take my eyes away from the house however when i realized we were leaving there was an unpleasant sensation in my stomach and my eyes were decidedly wide once again as i stared out of the window and at the sky leaving was a strange feeling abc we got to the station fifteen minutes before the train was set to leave at midnight and we immediately made our way to platform 9 3 4 where the scarlet steam engine sat waiting for us james took my bags from me without offering a word and then lugged both of our things onto the train leaving me standing next to jude well he turned to look at me smiling and he looked so exhausted you ll be safe wontyou lily jude smile faded and he turned quickly serious and the look on my face matched his own i wanted to ask him so desperately bad i will promise take care jude i stepped foward and hugged him and the fact he held on tightly for a moment longer well it worried me especially when he told me quietly not to worry the fact of the matter though was that i had no idea what it was i shouldntbe worrying about as if on cue james rejoined us and i spotted a frantically waving sirius and lethargic looking remus i smiled at jude tight lipped and went over to them leaving father and son to say their goodbye s there didntseem to be as many kids going back to hogwarts as there had been going home and that just didntadd up it wasntjust a lapse in judgement on my part and it wasntjust a few people missing there had to be at least twenty people missing it became obvious as we walked through the train looking for the compartment our bags were in and all we found were compartments occupied by one or two people only usually compartments were full even at the holiday s eventually we found the compartment that had been marked as our own by our belongings and of course there was one boy sitting in it hey wormtail sirius greeted the boy i was eyeing with a curled lip just for the fact that i didntwant to sit with someone i didntknow i looked at the other two confused but they smiled at the boy as well then i realized just who wormtail was peter pettigrew of course abc i wasntsure why i stayed in the compartment with the reunited marauders i guess because i hadntseen bridget as we walked through the train and i didntwant to go sit in a compartment by myself like everyone else was doing so we situated ourselves as comfortably as we could and they talked together for twenty minues incessantly remus sirius and peter sat on one side of the compartment sirius taking up more room of the seat than was necessary james and i sat on the seat across from them and it was roomy enough for two so i curled up near the window and stared out of it after those twenty minutes of non stop talking and catching up james excused himself for a moment saying he needed to go talk to somebody nobody questioned him so i just nodded as well the second james was gone from the compartment peter peered out of the door to watch until he was out of hearing distance and when he was he turned to sirius and remus his voice a hushed whisper and excited sounding i was talking to prongs earlier when he brought the bags onto the train i sat up straighter and turned to look at him with raised eyebrows though he wasntpaying attention to me yeah what your point pete remus asked lazily leaning down in the seat some well peter smirked as if satisfied with himself over knowing something they didntseem to know it just sounded like his holidays were enjoyable the two boys seemed to understand something in what he was saying that i didn t and all three of them looked at me you know lily dontyou peter remus said to his friend though didnttake his sudden bright eyed gaze away from me yes i do he looked down at his hands and then offered me a quick smile how how are you lil peter began but remus cut him off with a wave of his hand come off it that wasntmy point my point was miss evans here spent every waking hour of break at james house peter eyes widened and my cheeks flushed so we should just ask her how his holiday were dontyou think peter hurriedly agreed and i planned on hitting remus the second we were alone sirius seemed to have that plan in mind too as he wasntlooking at me any longer but instead glaring at remus do you care to comment lil thankfully james was back in the compartment before i could say anything and their interrogation of me was quickly forgotten when james took his seat next to me again he reached his hand out and gave my leg a gentle squeeze though his eyes were focused on his friends and his friends werentpaying us any attention i think sirius was trying to hex remus and peter was laughing a bit too hysterically for my liking i went to catch james hand as he pulled away but he snatched it back before his friends could offer us glance and then he was joining in with them watching intently i looked at peter i had always seen him with them but he never spoke much to me i dontthink he spoke much at all but particularly not to me it made you feel a bit more powerful to intimidate somebody even somebody as awkward as peter pettigrew yet sitting in this compartment with him i just felt annoyed at him he wasnta tall boy nor a very big one he was a bit chubby i thought under his school robes which he had been wearing since we entered the compartment and frankly i didntsee how he entertwined with the other three he was nothing like them really peter thin hair was a dirty blonde colour and laid listlessly on his head he had small brown eyes and a rather pointed nose he was quite gawky looking peter was nervous too even around his friends he d await their approval on everything he said and he watched them in somewhat of an awe remus seemed annoyed by him frequently it was obvious james liked to take advantage of the way peter idealized them and sirius sirius was good to him he was genuinely nice to peter and that the only reason i could see that they were friends with him he was loyal a bit of a mess and i supposed came in handy with their elaborate pranks but what i really wanted to know is what was so enjoyable about james holiday s and just what he had said to peter about them whatever the case i was smiling over it abc it was during that train ride back to hogwarts that i seemed to remember that i was head girl and james was head boy to my head girl it had been an easy position to avoid ignore and brush off for the first few months we gave prefects their duties arranged some meetings here and there took points away and wore our shiny badges but there was a shortage of prefects on this train ride back to school there were none actually and of course since there was a shortage of prefects there was an excess of fighting jame and me ended up patrolling the corridors of the train keeping slytherin and gryffindor serperated though they normally did that themselves as best we could we didntpatrol much together throughout the several hours we were on the train and the one time i did see him i tried to ask what the hell was going on with everybody but he just pretended not to hear it and walked away then when i did have a chance to return the compartment peter mentioned some blasted essay for transfiguartion that i swore i had finished but the more he talked about it the less familiar it sounded so i ended up writing it then on the train as it was due to mcgonagall the first day back at the castle even though we didnthave classes all in all it was an absolutely exhausting train ride and i could have bit someone head off by the time we arrived at school at something after 7 in the morning i noticed immediately the castle was sullen and quiet the air inside of the castle was almost dank and it was actually cruel to step in from the cold morning to such a suffocating atmosphere i had lagged behind the rest of the students as i had been deserted by the marauders couldntfind my wand to perform a charm on my bags and had to stop to prevent three different fights from occuring my bad mood was forgotten as i walked towards the marble staircase listening to my footsteps echo through the quiet hallway i set my bags down and looked inside of the great hall assuming there werentmany people down for breakfast yet but there were there were some people missing yes but the tables were still rather crowded every professor was seated at their table and everything was so bloody quiet the marauders had joined the gryffindor table and i scanned it quickly looking for bridget but she was missing as well ray wasntthere either so i just thought they were off somewhere together and no one was laughing and hardly anyone was eating and everyone was in deep conversation i walked away shaking my head and went to dig through my bags for my wand to lighten the load and i wondered what it was i didntknow that everyone else knew including the marauder s i was too tired to be angry but after a long sleep i wouldntbe after i passed a group of terrified looking first or second years and after i heard so many people crying and after i overheard the word dead six times i was already starting to get frustrated but there was some sinking numbness surrounding me and it seemed to be obvious to surrounding people because not a soul tried to speak to me not a soul told me why several hundred students were suddenly falling to pieces abc the familiarity i hoped to feel upon returning to the common room just wasntthere it was empty and things were carelessly strewn about and the hearth which usually had flames leaping about inside of it was burning low and maybe it was just my imagination but i thought i could see my breath as i walked to the dorm it was empty as well and my eyes danced about searching for some sort of comfort as i dropped my bags tossed my coat and shoes off and collapsed on my bed and comfort there wasntany i fell asleep slowly i could feel it my mind was bursting with scenarios and thoughts and for the few seconds between sleep and wakefulness i thought i might just implode but instead i just heard a voice it could have been my mother s or maybe it was remus s but somewhere in the back of my sleep groggy mind it was james s i wasnta coward it told me but that was no comfort i wasnta coward it repeated i was a fool a damn oblivious fool and in a way that i had yet to discover it was all james fault abc lyrics authoress note on my livejournal homepage link takes you there please read with love kaitlyn chapter 2 realizing lily abc lily evans was london england where i was born and raised her initals even fit it to perfection classy and british sophisticated and old fashioned busy though calm and lovely lily was pulchritudinous england was statuesque i d imagine if england could talk it would sound much like her so bloody british so headstrong and stubborn but pure in a way that absolutely breathtaking lily parents were happily divorced she had a horse toothed bitch of a sister and really this whole world outside of hogwarts that nobody quite realized was there for her the potter family would love her just take her in and never want to let her go being so outspoken and beautiful well my mum always was more in love with lily than i was i am james potter and i tried my hardest to ignore the debutante lily evans normal point of view why are you carrying evans bag an eyebrow raised james potter asked his best friend as he sauntered into friday breakfast will give me a reason to talk to her later sirius black grinned and set down beside remus across from james remus lupin was a sandy haired boy with pretty blue eyes just simple lovely blue eyes nothing more to describe then that he was handsome and peter wasnteven worth describing she rather good looking isntshe padfoot wonder what could be going on there remus offered a slight eye roll but couldnthelp but grin his one dimpled grin absolutely nothing chum so shut up yeah and she not just rather good looking she rather gorgeous james laughed quietly for a moment his eyes on his plate so he didntnotice his friends looking at him strangely it a fact not an opinion prongs sirius said flatly loading up his own breakfast dish james doesntlike evans much remus informed sirius who sniggered in response i couldnttell do you often call people you donteven know judgmental bitches sirius black always had an airy tone of voice and it just seemed to work well in situations where akwardness arose bloody hell like it matters i just the quiet head boy s not like it going to affect her much sirius always seemed to deflate james james potter had a way of being quiet yet the slightest bit arrogant when he was around his friends but when sirius spoke to him like he had better smarten up or stop acting like an ass or something of the like james voice went even quieter than normal going beyond a registered mutter james of course had his affect on sirius at times both could build the other confidence up and knock them down just as quickly james discovered that you couldntbe friends with sirius black and expect to be a quiet passive person but it what james was much of the time so he had to have his own ways of kicking black where it hurt and as mentioned by sirius before james throwing a word in before asshole or bastard was meant to be taken quite litterally he called him an evil cunning bastard once sirius didntspeak to him for weeks so anyways sirius was trying his best to guilt james potter just as lily evans was making her way to her end of the table saw sirius has your bag why that jada asked with a sly grin forming on her lips as she buttered her toast i really wasntin the mood for her i saw where carter hand was currently sliding up her leg and as if she really wanted to talk to me right now just making conversation plus it was none of her business did i ever know when she got a new boyfriend or when her parents declared they were getting divorced hell i donteven know when she mad at me so it was none of her business that sirius had tied my shoes quite well and had carried my bag in and hadntgave it back none at all because there was no business to be hers there was none to be mine for christ sake it was nothing right i dontknow i responded a few minutes too late she probably didnteven notice me sat there brooding as i shovelled cold scrambled eggs onto my plate whatever what do you mean you dontknow she half giggled playfully shoving carter off why was i friends with her again he just carried it in for me i guess i dontknow shut up i twirled my fork around the eggs and then pushed the plate aside picking my goblet of orange juice up and sipping from it jada laughed her cute little laugh which i hated and then whispered to carter in a loud voice so i could hear but she could pretend like she thought i wouldn t god pms much i wanted to cry again and punch james potter and push jada off some cliff not carter though because he really was sweet i dontknow how she ended up with him as she whispered loudly to him he made an apolegetic face to me and shook his head as she giggled more good i hope he dumps her and just breaks her heart of course then i ll have to hear about it i dontknow she so attention seeking she always has been when we were 11 and 12ish everybody thought it was cute but when you re almost 18 and still whining and throwing yourself at any boy that looks your way well it not very attractive people feel sorry for her i know her parents divorced last year she pretended to take it hard i dontknow if she actually did or not i donteven know the real her anymore i used to and i miss that she was a sweet person who used to send you a letter just to see how your day went god i dontknow what happened and lately it becoming apparent to me that i dontbloody well care friends suck girls suck catty whores and sirius somewhat of an invitation to start hanging out with the marauders was seeming so appealing as i stormed to their end of the table wanting to grab my bag i straightened my blouse out and took a deep breath as i walked quickly down to the marauders yes luv sirius asked while turning around before he even knew who it was see charm just seeps from him can i um have my school bag i asked rather awkwardly sirius was intimidating even if it was my school bag he laughed for a second and then picked it up from where it sat behind him it is yours you need not ask m dear thanks i murmured feeling james eyes on me as i took the bag and i continued my dash like walk out of the hall something the matter evans on my way to transfiguration class high tailing it and trying my damndest to avoid anybody glances as i wiped furiously at threatening tears i d be about 20 minutes early for class anyways but i didntcare god i didntcare this is all that seems to matter anymore bloody classes because everybody else was slowly losing focus and grasp and new people were forcing their way through and i had no idea why it scared me so much things changing i was never one for change unlike jada i really did take it hard when my parent split it may have been for the better really but there went an era there went everything i knew even if all i ever knew was their constant bickering it all i remember of my childhood i swear evans james potter was half a corridor behind me but quickly catching up and conveniently interrupting my thoughts and pity party what the hell do you want i spun around and rather spat at him a couple younger kids walking by started running and whispering his right hand jumped to his right cheek and he ran his index finger below the frame of his glasses i had my jaw clenched at the time and i remember it slowly unclenching and my heart jump for a moment as i realized that james nervous habit or whatever the hell it was it was the first time he had done it in my presence because of me i he faltered as our charms professor stuck his head out into the hallway and raised his eyebrows at the two of us us being so far apart james had to rather shout could you come here maybe he lowered his voice as flitwick shut his classroom door no i just didntwant to i wanted to detach myself from everyone at the moment the marauders yeah were looking appealing more so then jada but sirius inparticular was making them looking appealing not the one who thought me to be a bitch listen he cleared his throat and took hesitant steps towards me that echoed loudly in the corridor i m sorry for calling you what i called you sirius told me i made you feel bad and dontget upset with him for telling me he just well apparently you made an impact on him evans and anybody who good in his books should be good in mine but i just i thought he may elaborate further on his bitch comment but he didn t maybe we can talk more some time i dontknow i sorry is all i couldntfinish eating breakfast because he said you had been crying and just dontlet something i say affect you like that heh really what am i to anyone the quiet guy who hangs out with sirius so just get over it he had went from being rather sweet to quiet again back to sweet and then rather bitter asshole like i just stood blinking at him as his nervous habit right hand was now rumpling the hair at the back of his head it something he just did james had always done it first just walking through the halls trying to distract attention from his face when you were talking to him or when a girl he liked was near and he was laughing with his friends sirius had picked up on it james was one of those people who was so intricately detailed that you picked up on his little quirks without realizing it you started talking like him thinking like him and eventually sympathizing with the drama he had to contend with and then falling in love with him but hell that another time same story just another time just get over it pot james i dontknow what s with you i mean that in the gentlest way possible you f ing change pages quicker then i can follow i donteven know if i want to follow so just whatever you apologized and should ve left it at that see ya later i adjusted the strap of my bag and walked away in a huff see you around lily so so so so quietly not in the same sense as a whisper just so quietly just so hardly there but he had said it and as i rounded the corner i stopped walking feeling a rush of emotion and a stinging at my nose and james potter was still standing where he had been when he apologized this is my life in the common room there were so many sofas and chesterfields and chairs my favourite though was by the large fireplace there was a coffee table and set on either side of the coffee table were two long couches it was gorgeous to just sit there in the evening curled up with a good book reading by the firelight while everyone else conjured up and lit lamps lighting the room but this part of the common room was always nice and cozy i was indulging myself in reading gone with the wind and it was the next day saturday at last it was about 10 30 and everything was so nice and quiet my mum always told me i d go blind if i read by such a dim light james potter made his presence abruptly known as he was stood behind the couch i was curled up on is that why you have glasses i asked not taking my eyes from the page almost lost my place nope i near sighted i dontknow when exactly she told me that because i never did read much i let the book fall shut and kept my finger between the pages marking where i had left off would you like to sit i moved my feet from the couch and sat up as james seemed to contemplate just jumping over the back of the couch and plopping down next to me or walking around the end to come sit next to me he chose the more gentleman like one walking around the end and then to where he could sit next to me careful to avoid touching the blanket that was draped over my lap he was always doing what he thought other people would approve of always being so damn polite always being on time for class and always walking around sofas rather then jumping over them i must say i almost would ve rather if he had jumped over something spontaneous something a typical 17 year old boy would do but hell james potter was not a typical 17 year old boy i remember so vividly the first time he was late for a transfiguration class probably about december of 7th year i thought he d be absolutely mortified and offer to serve a detention for the old bag but he just casually strolled in his hand running through his hair and he cleared his throat as indication that he had arrived professor mcgonagall said nothing just simply waited until he was seated to go on him i had been up late the night before but there was still a long way to go before december and before being late for classes a couple of months hardly but it seemed like forever james time trying to win him over december 18th 1977 is this the craziest thing you ve ever done james potter the wind was blowing lightly chilling me to the bone but i just pulled my cloak tighter around me and adjusted my scarf i think you d be surprised at the crazy stuff i ve done lily evans i laughed as james rubbed his gloved hands together and blew on them to warm them through the material well i glad you re doing something crazy with me it wasntcrazy far from it we were just out on the grounds at 2 am in the morning it was just absolutely gorgeous out for some reason the fact we had snow just seemed to dawn on me and the moon was so bright and almost full the way it shone off of the snow and made it sparkle and twinkle almost more then the stars in the clear sky breathtaking i swear i glad too that was the end of that night for me him saying he was glad too but he went on you see i mean i hardly know you i rolled my eyes at this he had been saying it often we re hardly friends but here i am if i had known that in 2 months james would be saying he hardly knew me and that we were hardly friends well i know i would ve continued talking to him beforehand and i would ve continued trying but had i known that only as far as we d get in 2 months i would ve been so disappointed but i knew he didntmean it knew that he just didntwant to think that we were friends so immersing yourself in the life of scarlett o hara mmm james leaned his head back until his neck touched the couch and then he stretched himself out folding his arms over his chest not necessarily rhett not really my type james laughed i guess he found it amusing i becamse so attached to characters of a book that were supposed to be good looking or whatever why that well he has facial hair not a big fan of it i grinned as james slowly ran a hand over his chin facial hair is all that it depends on he raised his eyebrows i sighed no i just i dunno he just not my type well my dad would be your type he bald and facial hair less does that worry you then bald ness he chooses to be bald because his hair was exactly like mine james chuckled lightly and tilted his head to the side rather gazing at me i realized i liked him like this just with me not calling me a bitch and what not it was almost nice so what would your typ his question was cut off as a commotion arose from the boys dorm peter came tearing down the stairs with sirius black aiming things at his head with his wand and shouting at him james closed his eyes and rubbed his brow he jogged over to his friends completely forgetting to finish his question or even have me acknowledge the fact he was going i wasntreally bothered i just wanted him to finish asking his question the next month was a cold one that for certain the weather worsened yet no snow showed itself yet that was probably one of the worst things there was well into november and well into the negative temperatures yet no snow it was depressing in a sense everything was grey the grass was dead and frost covered and the trees were bare the sky didntoften change except to allow clouds to billow through homework came steadily and classes werentmuch more challenging then expected everybody was comfortable thus meaning everything was dull and boring lily evans hadntreally spoke another word to james potter since that night nor sirius black casual hello s but nothing in depth and to further the beginnings of friendship she also hadntpaid one bit of attention to a miss jada morgan which made things quiet and boring but she thought if jada wanted to bother with their friendship then she would her carter were still seeing one another though he had requested to see other people things were boring life was dull and november was the absolute worst month to have to suffer through and lily evans 18th birthday was on the 12th of that month abc jada forgot everybody forgot my parents forgot chapter 20 morbid beauty abc yellow by coldplay abc this is what living feels like it was four o clock in the afternoon and i walked through the corridors of hogwarts my transfiguration essay in my hand the parchment slightly crumpled but it didntreally matter to me because it was horrible the dorm had been empty when i woke up and the common room was quiet no one looked up no one spoke to me i didntspeak to anyone people were surrounding themselves with their friends and no one else could penetrate the atmosphere around those groups talking so quietly so morbidly so blatantly it made me think that i should be with my own little group of friends fretting over what had happened and i smiled when i realized i did not have a group of friends let alone actually know what had happened this is what it feels like to be alive the sky was such a dark grey that you could almost feel the storm moving in you could almost see the wet heavy snow start falling from the clouds before it actually occured you could almost breathe in the heavy distraction a storm would offer just now torches flickered as the wind howled through the castle corridors and most everyone was warm in their common room s until dinner time came my footsteps echoed loudly obnoxiously as i made my way to professor mcgonagall office and it soon became a steady rythm inside of my head that grew exceedingly hard to ignore this is what it means to be alive i knocked on the office door twice and it swung open on it own accord mcgonagall flailed her hand from where she sat at her desk and beckoned me inside i set the essay on her desk she thanked me much too immersed in the piles of parchment before her to pay much mind to me and then i left heading straight back to gryffindor tower i kept my head down my arms crossed over my middle offering a bit of comfort from the gnawing hunger residing in my stomach i had skipped out on breakfast slept through lunch and had to wait an hour until dinner i was starving for the first time in two weeks and i realized i was longing for a day of nothing but eating mrs potter baked good s or maybe i was just longing for a mum to take care of me and make sure i ate all of my meals on time this cantbe what living feels like or what it feels like to be alive or what it means to be alive it cantbe i decided firmly tightening my arms around myself and frowning at my feet it cantbe because it didntfeel much like being alive right now i vaguely wondered if i d turn out to be one of those people who just arentable to take advantage of life of living of breathing i wondered if i was incapable of really realizing what any of those three things actually felt like living i decided felt much more like suffocating much more like dying and i assumed that couldntbe quite right i looked up from my feet pulled myself from my thoughts and bumped straight into sirius the parchment in his hand fell to the ground and i stared down at it not offering to pick it up for him i shifted my weight from my left leg to my right leg and grinned awkwardly as i watched sirius bend down to pick up the parchment which i assumed was his transfiguration essay it seemd for a fleeting moment that he even had to swallow his pride over a small thing like this sorry i choked out suddenly running a hand back through my hair it alright you can walk with me to mcgonagall office i felt like slumping down in the middle of the corridor and crying because i didntwant to walk back there but i didntwant to walk to gryffindor tower either i turned around with him walked with him back to mcgonagall office in silence i was rather surprised to find i was only a short distance from it anyway and then we headed back to gryffindor tower i dontreally want to go back there do you he said casually as sirius could and casting an eye over me observing me in a way that could only be called delicate no i replied hardly before he was done his question and stopped walking sirius stopped too and quirked an eyebrow at me as he turned around he would have said it he was the sort of person to do that he would have said lily evans you re out of your mind right now but instead he just asked me what was troubling me and i wasntsure if i answered him or not the next thing i recalled was the feel of the biting wind over my face as we walked down the stone stairs leading away from the castle it was liberation within itself just to be outside of the castle and i hadnteven been back for a day i breathed deeply shivering profusely alongside sirius and he let me have that moment to breathe he seemed to understand that i needed that moment to breathe and i knew that he d stand there all day with me if i needed him to somewhere in the back of my mind that wasntbeing smothered by james and the rest of my thoughts i wondered why it couldntstill be him but then really had it ever actually been him lily it was snowing it had been snowing since we came out but it was a quiet sort of snow feather light flakes floating down to the ground and hardly adding up to anything a few snowflakes clung to my eyelashes before metling the water sliding down my cheeks as the snow began to fall faster it became almost blinding to watch it and a perpetual calm settled around us it was a quiet quiet snow lily his voice broke into my thoughts again but this time i didntignore him as i had accidentally the last time i looked over at him waiting for him to continue though not really wanting him to sirius dark hair was becoming rather shaggy i noticed as he shook it from his eyes there was an almost graceful waviness to his hair and it fell in place with such ease he wore a charcoal grey sweater and a pair of nice dark jeans he was a lovely contrast against the white of everything around us and there was an air of nostalgia to him his eyes danced around lazily observing the world as if it were there for him only and when he looked back to me i realized his eyes were like ice a terribly cold shade of grey with the slighest offering of blue in them they were piercing and fathomless and within them lay everything sirius black was lily his voice had gone from worried and delicate to rather annoyed would you listen to me eh my eyes were watering as i hadntblinked for a few moments and my eyelids fluttered about as i diverted my stare away from him i sorry i told him and he tugged a bit of lint off of his shirt before looking back to me i just asked you three times what going on in that head of your s it was a question that someone should have asked him but nobody thought to nothing i thought rather than said not a thing there were just whispers of deaths and flames so blue and the world coming to an end a hundred different times there was nothing going on in this head of mine i thought still not speaking for in that moment all of my thoughts were borrowed from someone far more cynical far more insane i thought rather than said there were just whispers of deaths and flames so blue and the world coming to an end a hundred different times i thought still not speaking for in that moment all of my thoughts were borrowed from someone far more cynical far more insane what happened sirius i asked him quietly feeling the wind pick up and it blew straight through the clothes i wore straight through my skin and it chilled me to the very bone as he locked his icy depths on me there was silence and he stared at me the look on his face changing from determined to positively torn he was more amazing more good than he let himself believe you ve got to ask james that one lily i took a deep breath pursing my lips and exhaled through my nose my nostrils flaring unattractively has someone died sirius he was somehow standing directly in front of me leaning over me a bit seeming taller than he actually was the wind howled hollowy and his warm fingers came down onto my arm and i could feel their warmth as he gripped my upper arm tightly through my shirt his nod confirmed what overheard conversations had previously confirmed someone died lily his voice soft yet rather hoarse and as he hunched his shoulders up i realized that he was blocking me from the biting wind because the last thing i needed was to become numb who i bemoaned before i could stop myself and his hand slid up and down my arm quickly a mesmerising pattern comfort comfort comfort he didntsay anything just bent until his chin rested atop my head for a quick second and then he was leading us back towards the castle the wind blowing harder and the snow falling heavier i had to talk to james whether he talked to me or not the inital determination to talk to james faded swiftly however as the two of us walked back to the castle the smell of a warm meal wafting through the air in the entrance hall food took priority over talking to james as i d have to find him first and he did a rather good job of not being found when he didntwant to be you coming i asked sirius as i turned towards the great hall whereas he kept walking towards the staircase i ve got some things to take care of you go on green eyes he quirked an eyebrow at me and smiled with all of the blas wonderment in the world he was the only person in the whole world who was like that i watched him climb the staircase and i was suddenly overwhelmed with some unknown fleeting feeling i think it was appreciation i walked through the great hall going to take a seat at the end of the gryffindor was quiet and sad and classes started tomorrow and it seemed as if a quarter of the student population was still missing and somebody was dead it was now a fact it was a solid truth that someone had died one i couldntquite get my head around abc that evening i sat in the common room at sirius secure side as he poured over some unfinished homework and i read a book i didntfail to tell him what i thought of being left alone at dinner no it would have been better if i was actually alone but instead i endured dinner with remus and peter if i hadntbeen so damned hungry i would have left but i chose to sit through remus snide comments and peter laughter neither of which i understood i thought remus was making the comments to have peter laugh but everytime peter laughed remus asked him why he was such a pansy and then peter would laugh because he was uncomfortable and it was easily the most awkward meal of my life sirius apologized invited me to sit with him while he did his work and i did so without even question of why he wasntwith the other three at around 8 o clock sirius began glancing towards the grandfather clock that stood in the common room every five minutes until half past eight he would look up look towards the portrait hole and then back to his work when the clock came to 8 30 though he packed his things up and watched the potrait hole for a few seconds until in came peter peter didntcome over to us just stood near the opening for a minute before leaving it was supposed to be a singal of some sort for sirius and he took it leaping up immediately stowing his bookbag next to me you ll take this to the dorm for me wontyou he smiled when i nodded already beginning to walk away i ll see you later lily stretching i shut the book i had been reading the one james gave me for christmas and looked around the full room bridget was still missing people were still sad someone was was still dead and i still knew where james bed was i had got tired of sitting there in the common room with no one to talk to and watching jada sit in a corner with some random boy and perhaps she was the only other people who was as oblivious as me though she was just born that way the last time i was in the dorm it was dark cold and i hadntnoticed those pictures on james nightstand i stood next to it sirius bookbag dropped somewhere in the middle of the room and picked up a picture of someone who looked vaguely familiar she was pretty wholesome smiling she had an alabaster skin tone and freckles brushed along her cheekbones and nose her hair was a pretty strawberry blonde and ran down her back in sleek straight layers and her eyes were the most vibrant colour blue oh i murmured realizing just who the petite girl was looking so awkward in her dark hogwarts uniform yet so much like a woman i peered closer at the picture that didntappear to be magical someone had taken the picture at bit of an angle as if they were looking up at her from a slant perhaps near the lake the sun was in the background she was smiling with ease and it looked as if the wind had blown her hair around jocelyn it was jocelyn james first non love his first almost love she was the one who got away i thought and she was married on the 1st of january i could hardly believe james was with her just a few months ago she was his opposite i had remembered him telling me that she was dainty and elegant pretty and fragile this warmth this innocence just radiated about her and i did not compare myself to her as i had often compared myself to melly i just looked at the picture of the beautiful girl who james didntlove and i wondered hell if he couldntlove her who could he fall in love with i fell asleep waiting for james i laid in his bed underneath both of his comforters and sheet having tugged off the sweater i wore i was left in a white tank top and my jeans that i hadntyet bothered to change out of i was exhausted and classes hadnteven started yet i hated what i did to myself i hated how i was stressed out before i even had a chance to be it wasnta healthy sort of way to live abc it was ten o clock when i woke up and there were tingling sensations in my right arm as if i had laid on it and it had fell asleep too groaning i rolled over shaking my arm the best i could beneath the covers and smacked my dry lips together before licking them waiting for somebody lily part of me expected it to be remus and another hoped it would be sirius even a far off part of me wondered if it would be peter pettigrew to discover me in james bed this time but it was the one person i hadntcounted on talking to that night the one person i had came here to talk to but the intentions of doing so the courage to do so had ebbed away slowly until i was left with none it was james standing there with the hangings pulled back looking down at me rather bemused you of course i told him through a yawn and everything about him just then was raw and genuine it was a rather emotional sight to see him he smiled his lovely lips staying pressed together and he ran a hand through his hair while i just wanted to reach up and capture that bit of james that seemed to be left you look morbid i said as the faint smile left his lips and permanent weariness settled in amongst his features you look beautiful he quipped with a cheeky grin while leaning down to kiss my cheek it was morbid beauty and had we not been the definition of it we would have been completely engrossed in it fascinated by it contradictions and paradoxes jocelyn has vibrant blue eyes i thought as james positively threw himself down onto the bed next to me but i ve got green ones abc green eyes by coldplay abc for a moment that fell much too short there was silence and i listened to his heavy breathing while he laid face down on the bed before i could speak before i could let the word dead fall from my lips again he was wrenching the covers out of my grip as i held the blankets tight against me and pulling them away from my body tossing them down to the foot of the bed he propped himself up with his right hand and looked down at me with an easy yet penetrating stare it was scrutinizing warm and nothing that i needed just then goosebumps protruded along my skin as his gaze swept over me and he brushed his hand against my bare arm it was the stare though that caused those goosebumps i felt the same way everytime he looked at me a way i couldntquite describe james i said as he ran his hand up my arm resting it on my shoulder through the dark of the room and the convulsive shudders running through my body i felt his eyes lock with my own and his lips tugged up in what was a sad smile he said nothing and i just watched him as if i was incapable of doing anything else perhaps i was incapable though when he was like this then in half a second he had slid his hand not preoccupied with holding himself up beneath the strap of my bra and the strap of my tank top pulled both of them down from my shoulder and left them hanging against my upper arm i thought maybe i had gasped when he did it but my mouth was shut and my breathing was regular and it was if this was the most natural thing in the world somewhere in the back of my mind i couldntunderstand i couldnt believe that this was james potter not tonight not like this james lowered himself back onto the bed and the upper half of his body covered my own his mouth followed a trail that would become familiar to him as he brushed it against my arm trailing it up and finally he pressed his lips against my exposed shoulder it was the warmest most dizzying feeling i had ever experienced as he opened his mouth against the skin and lightly tasted it he pulled his head up after a moment and looked at me his lazy hazel eyes flickering in the candle light of the room they werentnecessarily lacking anything they were still so very alight still penetrating and infinite no there was something more to them something a bit off something a bit damaged a little bit of hurt the second i opened my mouth to speak he turned his face away shifting he pushed me further into the bed resting on top of me and buried his face in my neck i sighed as he mumbled in a satisfied sort of way breathing warmly against my neck i wondered if maybe i should cry if maybe i should fall apart and break down i didntknow this side of him as well as i would ve liked i didntknow james to be so close intimate and lovely i decided i d never tire of him being any of those three things james i finally found myself whispering to him and it was his turn to sigh he didntsay anything however and something quite unsettling lingered in the air until i spoke again james i need you to tell me who died for a moment his breathing was constricted and i heard him swallow hard a few times before i could feel his breath on my skin again his chest rising and falling quickly against me why he croaked out his face pressed hard into my neck his lips touching it as he spoke i thought maybe i saw stars or angels i saw angels that night why do you need to know why do you need to know something like that it destruction it suicide it bloody awful yet you need to know you dont need to know lily you barely even want to know but you re so terribly spiked with curiousity i did not utter a single word a single sound his lips on my skin tremors running through my body the cold of the night of this room finally getting to me along with nerves then as if i were in a daze i heard him say it his voice low and faroff his face no longer buried in my neck jocelyn i think that when i started crying i didntthink i was crying then but thinking back now i was i was crying maybe because he needed someone to cry for him but mostly because i needed someone to cry for me and he never once asked me to stop abc there was a dull buzz to the room when i woke a persistently low dull buzz my eyes struggled open flitting this way and that seeing nothing but the dark of the room the buzz i decided was in my head the room was quiet too quiet achingly quiet i groaned rubbing my sore eyes and turned over facing the boy i had almost forgot about he even looked solemn in his sleep his eyes almost squeezed shut and the whole form of his body was tense i vaguely remembered laying there next to him crying for a brief amount of time and then his breathing had slowed into a melodic rythm and i followed suit closing my eyes and sleeping next to him i wondered if he was going to be silent like that from now on my eyelashes were clumped together sooty with mascara and instead of waking him up i just wiped beneath my eyes again and again trying to remove any stray bits of black for a moment i pictured myself removing stray bits of black from him stray bits of black that stained his very core stray bits of black that were put there unknowingly by a girl he had given up six months ago i wondered if he she would still be alive and well if he had only loved her if she had only loved him with a smile with some completely horrid smile i told myself that love really couldntsave anything but i was just bitter it was just something i wanted with a sigh i sat up taking a hair tie off of my wrist and putting my hair up i looked down at james and a pang of guilt of empathy of absolute affection wracked through my body i knew that i needed to leave that i couldntfind myself in his bed night after night the two of us needed a dose of reality that we had been deprived of for all of the holiday s it wasntjust me and him anymore but i was selfish and i was needy and i was certain that he d be alright i was certain that he d get up the next morning and be james potter with an air of finality it was 3 30 in the morning we had just fell asleep james had just left it hanging he was so at odds so hurt i decided jocelyn was dead and i wasntquite sure why i had cried it had been there for days it had been building slowly there was an air sadness around me i reached a hand out towards his forehead brushing some silky hairs from off of it and there was a long minute in which i imagined him depressed quiet reserved moody god everything he had been everything he was still somewhere in there i didntwant i didnt need that james i needed the james that i had just days before held so very tightly in my grasp but maybe he d need me now abc are you leaving or no james had woke up he had turned over onto his back though his eyes were still closed and his voice was rather hoarse i had been sitting up for a few minutes staring out through the gap in the hangings at the bed directly across from james s i wondered who it was who quiet breathing i could just barely hear who hangings werent completely shut sirius bed james told me suspecting my thoughts and then he tugged the hangings shut they canthear us if the hangings are shut you know and we canthear them i nodded familiar with the charm put on the beds the charm was placed on the beds so you wouldnthave to contend with your room mate snoring but it was quite the convenient thing for 7th years who just didntstay in their own dorms are you implying something mr potter i asked him raising my eyebrows as he snaked an arm around my waist trailing his hand up and down my side silly girl he said and it sounded like he may have been smiling i much more of a gentleman than that i was just thinking it best if certain dorm mate of mine didntknow a certain girl was in my bed i nodded whether he could see it or not and we stayed quiet for a few minutes i dontwant you to leave tonight alright there no point in it now just stay it broke my heart a bit to hear him talk like that with some casual desperation but he wanted me to stay and that felt rather nice to hear i can t though i told him feeling his fingers dance beneath the hem of my shirt the other girls will know i was up to something we re head girl and boy it nobody business if we re in our own beds or not he hissed to me turning over onto his side looking up at me james us being the heads is more of a reason for me to leave than it is for me to stay we re supposed to you know set an example at this he scoffed and took his arm from around me resting it on the bed instead sighing gently i leaned down and kissed him on the crown of his head i love those lips he murmured his eyes shut once again i shook my head saying something about needing a bit more experience with them before he could say that and these legs he interrupted pulling the covers away from my lower body and resting one of his hands on my leg nearest him just above the knee i love these legs you re something devilish i told him as he pulled me down abruptly and kissed the very corner of my mouth the smile that played over his face just wasntnearly as honest as he tried to make it i felt guilty taking this from him as he offered it these light hearted moments wrapped up in some depressed mess it wasntwho he should ve been that night yet i loved it so much his face was very near mine i realized and his eyes were very dazzling you look like you just stopped crying a minute ago james said quietly it was funny how night just offered that sort of impression even if nobody could hear us we spoke near a whisper it fit the atmosphere honest your cheeks are all stained a rough thumb brushed one of my cheeks and i exhaled heavily shutting my eyes willing myself to not go back to sleep you let me cry i told him harsher than i had intended to i didntknow what i meant i didntknow how i had expected him to stop me i suppose i just thought maybe he d ask me to i felt him nod the first time i made her cry he paused for a moment letting me realize he meant jocelyn and letting me realize he wasntabout to say her name i expected it to be heart breaking and i thought i d feel bloody horrible but it was strange it was a bit of a relief to see her cry to know she had those sort of emotions she was very good at hiding what she was actually thinking and each time i made her cry i knew that she was thinking something that she was really hurting everytime after that i just let her cry asking a woman to stop crying makes them cry harder and i only made that mistake once he cleared his throat and i quirked my lips sadly at him you make it sound like you made her cry all of the time james looked me right in the eye i did she didntlike much i had to say i could be a bit impulsive with a weary sigh he corrected himself i can be a bit impulsive there was an incredibly awkward silence and then he was saying goodnight i ll see you in the morning lily was his goodnight accompanied by a large yawn a sudden romantic part of me wondered if he d kiss me again but i scrambled from the bed far too fast to allow that to happen stopping only to pick my sweater up off the floor and i swore i saw the hangings on a bed that wasntjames flutter shut abc marching bands of manhattan by death cab for cutie abc i sat there late that afternoon waiting for dinner time to come after the holiday s and the excessive eating you did it felt strange to actually be starving i felt all i did was run around all day from class to class from meal to meal wondering if things were going to start sinking in soon for the first couple of classes everyone just stared blankly at the professor realizing we d have to start taking their threats with the work getting harder seriously soon we were on the downside of 7th year this was really the beginning of the end and before we could actually learn anything we had to let that monumental fact break the surface it was terrifying my nerves seemed to be on end already i was flustered and furious throughout much of the day through all of my classes except for charms which still came easily i had taken a brief interest in transfiguration and i thought it was just mcgonagall stern ways that made me dread it despite excelling in both of those classes i still wasntany further in knowing what i wanted to do in my life i could see myself married before i was nineteen pregnant by twenty and widowed by twenty two it the way the world seemed to be working lately and it was kind of worrysome how i was just settling with those ideas accepting them books laid on the table before me homework was calling my name yet i was only concerned of two things food and james potter he didnttalk much throughout the day though nobody really did nobody really had anything to say except to voice depression about being back in classes he looked terrible which was strange to me at first because i had been with him just a few hours previous but then i realized i hadntactually seen him the dorm being so dark and this is what he had looked like the whole time he was being that affectionate mess he was unshaven this morning and pale dark circles beneath his eyes and his hair was mussed terribly his tie was crooked his shirt wrinkled and he scuffed his shoes along the floor as he walked every time either of us james or me yawned remus would cast a curious look in our direction and i decided that he knew i had been there last night i had just started to let it bother me when an image of remus and melly ran through my mind and i smiled smugly blessing blackmail whole heartedly sitting there late in the afternoon i couldntquite forget that morning when a 7th year girl from hufflepuff nonetheless bounded over to the gryffindor table and stood behind james her name was penelope and she had blonde hair pulled away from her face in pigtails she was short and curvy had a button nose and lovely chocolate brown eyes she could have been cute if her voice hadntbeen so sickeningly sweet hullo james she greeted too plesantly her hands clasped in front of her the white uniform shirt she wore enhancing her bust unattractively with a barely supressed groan james turned round to greet penelope with a small smile and a good morning she began talking then rambling almost about how sorry people were and how she wished wished wished she could do something to make him feel better i was sitting next to him watching the expression on his face out of the corner of my eye she was talking about jocelyn and he seemed perplexed as to why we werenttogether he interrupted uncertainly and penelope nodded i know but you two were just so in love sirius snorted ungracefully at this i recalled for a moment james mentioning sirius not liking jocelyn i wondered if he d like her now if he d be respectful now that she was dead and i sure you re still hurt and i am here for you if penelope let me say this first and once i say this if you feel like you should continue then by all means but first you should know that this could be a waste of your time because i already have a girlfriend james voice was low as he told her eyebrows raised pointedly his friends no longer listening i heard him though and i choked on my scrambled eggs oh well she struggled to quickly regain composure as her face immediately fell at his statement that not what i was over here for i just wanted to tell you that i here for you i vaguely found myself wondering if she had ever spoke a word to him before this morning see you james she said walking off with a wave he said nothing turning back towards his breakfast and taking a drink of his orange juice i stared at him the other three marauders pouring over a morning prophet and talking amongst themselves maybe it was a stupid question an incredibly ignorant question a question that could have him changing his mind or maybe realizing what he had just said it came from my mouth before i could think of a more eloquent way to ask it and it just hung there between us for what could have been an eternity you have a girlfriend he buttered his toast and slathered strawberry jam on it he took a bite chewed it slowly and wiped the corners of his mouth with a napkin then he looked at me with those hazel green orbs narrowed slightly as if he were delightfully puzzeled well what would you like me to refer to you as i gaped at him feeling an odd soaring sensation in my stomach and also fighting the feeling to slap him i wanted to kiss him after i slapped him and i wanted to bloody well tell him that girlfriend was fine with me but it wasntfine with me our relationship was so incomplete and flawed and we had not even learned to tell each other the truth yet let alone make a commitment to one another not i not your girlfriend he took it in stride the expression on his face reamining as nonchalant as it possibly could despite the obvious distress in his features if that the case you wontmind if i go tell penelope i changed my mind james asked and i found myself glaring at him yes i would mind but you re not about to manipulate me he sighed loudly took my plate and put more scrambled eggs onto it sprinkled salt over them and put the plate back in front of me breakfast isntthe best place to be discussing this mmm eat up abc i was on my way back from dinner at something after 6 and had stopped a couple of corridors away from gryffindor tower to admire a portrait i had ate alone and quickly and was now just standing there smiling at a painting of a vase of flowers i could only imagine that i looked relatively insane as carter jada on again off again boyfriend who was also a 7th year gryffindor approached me coming from the direction i was going in jada she was someone i had easily forgot about it did something to my confidence to my pride to realize that the fact that i had quickly let got of that battered friendship i realized i deserved something better something real and had found myself in the grasp of the marauders sometimes i still have to think about how it really happened before he had even spoke a word i was thinking about asking him if he had finally gotten rid of jada for good he was far too good for her and treated her far too well he came from a good family was rather charming though bashful had a headful of curly brown hair and a toothy smile there was something about carter toothy smile this evening though that had me frowning curiously at him it was a cautious toothy smile he was still dressed in his uniform as was i his hands were shoved in the pockets of his trousers and his uniform shirt was untucked i could almost taste it wafting towards me something bitter something terrible lo lily he spoke in his low voice a bit of a smile still tugging at his lips hi carter i replied grinning and moving away from the portrait to stand in front of him in the middle of the corridor how are you i good i good he said distractedly running his fingers through his hair taking it back from his forehead i just i was just on my way to dinner and i was just wondering if you even knew i raised my eyebrows as he trailed off and my curious frown had returned well why dontyou tell me and we ll find out i suggested causually and i found myself holding my breath as he looked down at his feet shuffling them awkwardly bridget boyfriend ray you knew him yeah i nodded and he continued over the holidays there just were attacks i guess you could say new year eve there were a bunch of attacks on auror s ray well lily ray was killed i mean several other people were too but he was the only one that i knew personally i stared at him as he looked back up from the floor and he winced slightly you didntknow did you he asked sounding as if he felt terrible no i i looked away from him my eyes fluttering around trying to find something stable to focus my gaze on the whole world seemed to be spinning a bit i didntknow actually i knew that someone had died i didntknow ray had died or there were attacks i rambled on my hand raking back through my hair my cheeks flushing slightly i ve been a bit oblivious then haventi carter swallowed hard and he looked a bit pale honestly i sorry for being the one to tell you but i just felt it pretty bad if the head girl didnteven know i nodded thanked him for telling me and he hurried off to dinner as i dashed off towards gryffindor tower almost seeing red it was a bit easier to be angry right now rather than actually deal with what he had just told me and james potter voice was ringing in my head saying only jocelyn conveniently forgetting to mention attacks abc it had to have been ten minutes of pacing up and down the length of the corridor just outside the potrait of the fat lady she would not let me in apparently during the short amount of time i had been at dinner the password had been changed i explained to her that i was the head girl and that she had to let me in because i had to find james potter and throttle him though i did leave the last bit out i didnthave my badge on me though and of course the fat lady was having doubts that i sincerely was the head girl so i paced waiting for the damn potrait hole to open liable to bite the head off of the first person to come through it ironic that it was remus wearing his trademark faded jeans and snug tshirt despite the chilliness of the air in the castle i could not quite understand him he effectively ignored me going to walk right by me with his chin stuck out a bit where is he i called to remus as he was a few steps away from me there was a moment of hesitation before he stopped in his tracks sighed and turned to face me where is who lily he asked expressing the common exasperation he had for me shoving his hands in his pockets and i absolutely could not stand the images that flashed through my mind everytime i saw him unbuttoned jeans no shirt and the neighbour girl where is james remus i frowned at him as he smiled at me from across the hall a shrewd look playing over his features for a second i wasnthearing his voice full of dry wit and wry humor i was trying to imagine remus lupin as a compassionate sort of being but it was one of the most impossible things i had ever attempted nothing about him fit nothing about his life seemed to make sense he had these three friends who would likely sacrifice their lives for him and he for each of them and he had these amazing marks and this easy sophistication yet he was one of the most horrible people i had ever met when i thought of remus lupin i thought of my mum and i couldntfind a way to make that a good thing not that remus was a lot like my mum not that she was as witty and sharp as him but both of them drained me of all rational thought and both of them left me with some sort of regret i decided both of them were my challenges both of them dared me to be imperfect and to fail and make everyone miserable like they thought me to be sometimes i thought i was a bit in love with all of that though flashbacks of last night hmm remus voice cracked through my thoughts and i found myself standing quite near him on the other side of the corridor quick as lightning it came back to me and i was laughing maniacally stepping closer to him again you re not even going to go there are you remus i think now would be a particularly bad time to bring up miss melly and if you even think of telling sirius or peter or anybody that i was in the dorm last night i will find a few needless details to add to the story of your little rendezvous and maybe your friends will finally see the side of you that i always stuck seeing i had pushed him his back against the stone wall though he could have easily left he stayed there smiling at me someday do you find you might just snap lily remus murmured and i pushed him hard again satisfied with the groan of discomfort he uttered where is james remus i asked once again more desperately than i would have liked both of my hands were pushed against his shoulders pinning him there and he reached one of his own hands up to my wrist and gripped it painfully he leaving he spat at me squeezing so tightly that i pulled away from him gasping and staring at the red skin on my wrist he leaving so he ll be there for her funeral tomorrow he outside waiting for his bloody carriage evans and if you ever i didnthear the end of his threat as i had spun around and took off down the corridor my footsteps echoing loudly in my ears or maybe it was my heart beat abc straw dog by something corporate abc the evening was quickly darkening offering the lovely impression of serenity there was a light blue glow to the sky as the sun had just finished it sinking and when you looked over the horizon you could see the trees of the forbidden forest stretching outlined black into the lighter blue of the sky stars shone adordingly down on the grounds and the moon was seemingly missing streamed out from the chimney of hagrid cabin slowly but steadily and lights glowed warmly from his windows looking back up to the castle you could see faint light filtering down from some of the windows but for some reason being out here was more comforting than being in there it was a biting sort of cold that night a cold that freezes absolutely everything even the wind and there is nothing but still and quiet it the slightest bit eerie the slightest bit overwhelming but it welcome all the same my breath floated from my mouth at a lethargic pace almost looking as if it were going to stop and hang right in front of me it was whiter than it would have been if the night hadntbeen so cold but it was just indication at how bloody cold it was ahh i exhaled walking along the path my eyes straining to see james goosebumps covered my skin in an instant as i shivered and they almost ached i was in my school blouse and skirt still and hadnteven my robes on to keep me warm i mumbled beneath my breath cursing james potter for the inconvenience that i decided he was but then my thoughts shouted defiantly you know you d freeze to death for him i stopped in my tracks as i spotted him or rather the jagged outline of him against the night and i just assumed it was him i stopped though because it was a bit of a striking sight it was quite as if he had been standing there the whole time on the gravel drive the carriages came along but i had failed to see him then i wondered if maybe he just appeared there now if he were that magical his back was turned to me and i could think of nothing but of how angry i was with him as i walked towards him how angry i was with him for i wasntsure for everything truth be told for calling me his girlfriend for lying to me for letting me live in this false sense of security the whole time i was at his house during the holiday s i was angry with him for appearing so safe and broad and wonderful to me for being like coming home to me and then ripping that away from me because his ex girlfriend was dead and he hadntthe balls to tell me about it he had lied to me something i had done to him time and time again yet he was suddenly something else to me i couldntplace it i didntknow i thought maybe he was a bit of a coward but decided split second he may just have been the very definition of bravery i thought of sirius as i approached james or maybe i wasntapproaching him at all perhaps i was standing still and it was the world that was spinning fast and how good he was he was so good and so careful and nothing like he was in the beginning he was vunerable he was a letdown but he was incredible at being one and i wished so very deeply that he would fall in love some day it sounded foolish ridiculous because he was sirius black and you just associate him with love but not so much love as love affairs you associate him with passionate affairs and i didntthink anybody not james not remus not peter not anybody i didntthink anybody thought he d find love he was one of those people who seemed above love and commitments like he didntneed it it felt kind of nice to be the one to know that he did clearing my throat three times before my voice worked properly i shouted to him so you were just going to leave my voice hoarse as it was shaking as it was it was loud in this quiet twilight and he turned around quickly to look at me the dim lights from the castle windows reflected lively in his glasses and for a moment his eyes were dancing and he was every bit as vibrant and alive as he had always been i was afraid he d lose that for a day he called back sounding uncertain i ll be back saturday i didntsay another word to him just kept walking and eventually i found myself standing near enough to see the furrow between his eyebrows his face was smooth unlike earlier that morning the jeans he wore were dark and beneath his grey mixed tweed coat was a black sweater and sticking out of his coat wrapped proudly around his neck was a red and gold scarf there was a height to him that night that i swore had just been added in recent hours he never seemed that tall before and now he was towering over me as if he had the right to do so he blended in easily with the becoming night yet stood out from it vividly he was somehow darker than the sky than the black shadowed grounds around us he was darker and jagged but you could not miss him he was so very there when james saw i was without a coat he dashingly needlessly came to the rescue tearing his own off of him faster than i could imagine and thrusting it into my arms bloody mad woman he exclaimed watching me carefully until i put the still warm coat on and carefully met his stare what are you doing out here lily what wrong my body was quivering uncontrollably and i decided it was nerves instead of cold i wasntable to say anything for a long long while and we just stood him staring at me with something that didntreally stop my shaking you when you leave for a funeral even if it for a day you you have to tell me james i spoke thickly my voice deep and my nose stinging from the harsh cold air you cantjust leave when things are like they are you cant not tell me you you could have told me just like just like you could have told me about ray and about the attacks and oh no he muttered a hand going to his face and he rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses tiredly who told you it doesnt matter who told me because it wasnt you am i the only one who thinks this is significant i said my voice squeaking inelegantly and his frustrated sigh was not lost on me i could have been waiting for him to explain to say something of what he had concealed from me to offer some sort of apologie but there was nothing and we stood silently again it suited us well it suited the night it was refreshing breathtaking eye widening when a slight almost undetectable breeze picked up it offered something more than it actually offered it was just a cool breeze on a frigid night but there was redemption and dignity and composure somehow embedded in that brief wind it cooled my burning cheeks and my hair was left strewn about the only evidence that it had ever been there brush that hair from your eyes darling his voice broke the cold silence of the night very softly but very demanding i brushed the hair from my eyes putting it behind my ears immediately i stared at him feeling slightly flustered under his invasive frown but then his own eyes softened and he stared out over the grounds again i just dontneed anymore dreams dashed tonight the sudden absolute pulsing urge to touch his face that looked so warm and so nicely shaven surged through my body and i swore i didntcome here to cry i came here to yell at him what do you mean i murmured desperately wanting so badly to grasp onto something nothing he sighed once again as he ran his hand through his hair they re a bit of hope is all i saying it d be terrible to cover them up terrible that night i saw his face washed in the summer warm sun and his brow was sticky with sweat from the heavy suffocating air i saw him months from now and i saw his face contorted due to something i imagined was sex i saw him real out of this hell frozen over i honestly believed that this was going to last abc it ends tonight by the all american rejects abc he took both of my hands threading his fingers with mine and leaned his forehead against my shoulder we were standing a good distance apart and the cold around and between us was a vivid contrast against the warmth radiating off of his exposed skin james spoke in a low voice of days gone by and ruined holidays and of amazing smiles and he said that he thought he might have been trying to protect me it not as if i meant to lie to you i just didntthink you should know you were this outsider to me for a few days and i never considered why but i think because you seem to be this untouchable lovely thing to me and i just didntwant to ruin that you were so happy for so much of the holidays and i didn t i didntthink you should know i didntwant to worry you i just you left me alone with your five year old sister i mean your dad jude is some respected ministry employee and the day after it happens you find it safe to leave me with your sister you you didntwant to worry me james you cantkeep thinking that i going to break i pulled my hands away from his and i took a step back staring up at him there may be times that i falling apart a bit but i so tired of being this naive girl to you a faint sound drew the attention of both of us and we both saw the carriage making it way up the drive from the direction of hogsmeade i ll be going now i told him curtly staring at my hands willing myself to take his coat off wait i ll get sirius to come walk back up with you his hand slipped to the pocket of his pants and i had no idea what he was talking about but i shook my head anyway never mind it what am i going to get attacked on the way to gryffindor tower i shrugged i ll be fine james bent his head gave me a hard fleeting kiss on the lips and stared at me with a clenched jaw you you re the most selfish person i know he uttered in almost a growl you talk about compassion you look for compassion but do you have any do you have compassion for anyone but yourself lily james hands flew to my shoulders where he began pushing his coat off and tugging it forcefully off of my arms that wasnteven remotely funny and lily god if you re tired of being a naive girl to me stop acting like one hell you know what you mean nothing to me right now when he finally ripped the coat away from my body i stumbled slightly in the snow and frowned deeply at his retreating back the carriage was a few feet away and i heard james breathing heavily sniffing a few times as he waited for the carriage horsedrawn this time i noticed there was a driver and everything unlike the carriages that we came in at the beginning of school and the carriages that took us to hogsmeade weekends to come to a complete stop i saw him pull something that looked like a mirror out of his pocket and he was acutally speaking to it as i clumsily made my way back towards the castle i was panicking and left reeling and my lips were chapped and still rather burning from his kiss i kept thinking that had been the end that my one slip of the tongue my one stupid remark had ultimately ended anything before it actually began and i was almost sobbing as i climbed the steps to the castle i only gasped harder for breath trying not to cry as his voice ran incessantly through my head my mind imagining if you re tired of being a naive girl stop acting like one stop acting like one you selfish naive girl as i tugged one of the large oak doors open i saw the carriage leaving headed to hogsmeade and james potter was headed with the carriage though in a sense he was going in a complete opposite direction all i knew was that he was leaving and i thought once more leaving was a strange feeling being left even more so sirius met me on the marble staircase and he looked incredibly sympathetic i wondered if he was god in a sense this unknown saviour the night was to end on a rather peaceful note and sleep was a long lost friend abc done authoress note replies and lyrics on my livejournal love kaitlyn chapter 21 lost and found abc long day by matchbox twenty abc three weeks had passed quickly since classes had resumed there was a sort of dreary hell to every day january seemed to be in a constant state of and this january was no different the sky didntoften brighten and the only time it changed from it bland grey state was to cloud over darken in colour and i was beginning to hate the snow almost as much as i hated the rain it something you go through i think every season you get sick of the sun you get sick of the rain you get sick of the snow i ve found it in a human nature never to be completely satisfied or sated if there something more you could attain you want to there was never a happy medium and i was getting a little more sick to my stomach with each day someone had said it was all downhill from here graduation our lives were so very close whoever said that was a liar an idiot maybe it was me but whoever it was could never have imagined there would be more hills after all of these years i wondered wryly if there was ever a point in your life without hills where you didnthave to struggle for your sanity every waking minute james had returned on the day he said he would saturday bridget had as well they came to dinner together and i assumed they had taken the same train back to hogsmeade it was their own sad little parade as they walked into the great hall both of them gaining more attention than was necessary i became addicted to that perpetual sadness that hung heavily around james around everybody whether it was a concious decision or not i didntknow but it was the only emotion you could really realize anymore bridget wasntso much sad as she was angry she had always been a make love not war sort of girl one you just wanted to be around but now she was so bitter i found myself better friends with her now than before which made me feel a little strange i could be better friends with somebody angry then i could be with somebody happy what did it say about me really her long dark hair hung limply most days or she just threw it into a ponytail it like the rest of her had lost it vibrance she had lovely brown eyes and they were as lovely as always perhaps even more so there was a certain passion about the girl now that was completely undeniable she didnttalk about ray much and as if i could blame her she sat down with me the first evening she was back and she told me that she hated carnations it was the only flower at his funeral carnations were everywhere she said like some sea some blood red sea of carnations is that supposed to make it easier she asked me laughing dryly are flowers supposed to make death easier flowers are meant to be beautiful and why would you associate death with something beautiful i leaned back in the armchair i was sitting in and just listened to bridget talk james potter rather forcefully stuck in my mind not until she was finished ranting and raving about flowers and death and beauty before she was done it had all warped together and i swore she had said death is beautiful did i tell her i was sorry about ray she not so easily told me it was fine i thought it funny that she could be fine but i was far from such a a sort of heavy innocence hung in the air around us like a suffocating lie that grew bigger the more you believed it he lay next to me his breathing slow and steady much like he himself was there was nothing frantic or worried about him he was slow paced nonchalant and very lovely while doing so and he was steady so consistent so prominent so steady he was asleep his breathing told asleep with my sweater beneath him as i sat with my legs drawn against my chest hugging my knees tightly though he could not possibly see me through the dark and the fact that he was sleeping i felt the impulsive need to cover myself as i only wore a thin tank top the way he laid there was intimidating to such a point that i normally just left not wanting to talk about it not wanting to look at him not wanting to cry for the umpteenth time i could not leave this time because he had been getting frustrated with my disappearances and he was asleep on my sweater yes he was asleep on my sweater his shirt was off it had been when i came up and i felt my cheeks flush as i realized with a meek smile that i had seen three out of the four marauders sans shirt all in very different situations this one the most different of them all he was sprawled out with ease and gracefulness though i didntknow either were possible when one was sprawling conveying the fact that this was his bed he owned it and he was dominant his legs took up far too much room as they often did when he lay or sat in such an obnoxious manner and i would often tell him that i had no choice but to leave because there was no room for me an eerie light cast over his face from the moon filtering in through the closed hangings and for minutes at a time you could not look at anything but him because he was so dastardly handsome a chill ran through my body as i stared at his still form he was the only other person who did not want to talk about death sirius black was the only person as unpreoccupied with death as i was and it was for that reason and that reason only for the last two weeks i had found myself in his bed on several occasions kissing those lips the two of us didnttalk very much for the only thing anybody was talking about were the deaths and the attacks and the forming alliances either for bad or for good and the quiet sadness that covered everything was something that i could not quite understand yet i could not quite let go of i found it oddly fascinating the delicate atmosphere that seemed to envelope hogwarts it was addicting it the quiet the cold the heavy hearts was what i was preoccupied with not the death i felt a strange disconnection with everybody who had been affected by it everybody who read the newspapers and talked in hushed voices about the impending doom the end of the world whatever was to happen there was that disconnection there was that absolute loss of james and then there was sirius james hadntspoke to me the day he returned or any day after that and sirius had been careful to avoid that subject altogether he was very careful he tread softly it felt nice i decided to kiss a boy who had no intentions of breaking your heart and who was okay with the fact that he was seemingly being used my lip curled slightly and on it own accord as i thought about that using sirius i felt dirty somehow small and pathetic sirius was far too good to be used by some silly girl just because she cantquite find her place in the world he was far too good for that and far too good for me and my games i hated it when he smiled at me as if this was right sirius i have to go i said suspecting him to be awake now and i nudged him with my foot a few times to jar him what your point love normally you leave without formal goodbye s he turned over onto his back smiling smartly and stretched his arms over top of his head easing the sleep from his joints i nodded and quirked the side of my mouth offering him a bit of a hopeless look which he appeared sympathetic to and he sat up pulling my shirt out from under him and handed it to me i felt the strangest feeling of warmth toward him and i tugged my shirt on quickly trying not to recognize the feel of his eyes on me you re going to be okay sirius asked quietly and perhaps just for the false assurance i may offer him when you are asked that you say yes and the two of you continue to ignore anything and everything i tried very hard to nod and say yes and to thank him or something of the sort but neither of the three i could manage instead finding myself reaching for him and kissing him very soundly on the lips he was always very thorough and warm when we were together yet i did not find myself falling for him as we had fell for one another not so long ago and i hated that but could not help but enjoy the feeling of absolute freedom when i was around him you re so damned indecisive he muttered softly as he brushed his lips over my very flushed cheek and trailed his fingers up and down my spine my eyes fluttered and were begging to shut and i sometimes felt a sense of empowerment when that happened i could deny it i could still deny him and that charm i doubted there were many girls who could say that was one of their accomplishments by no means do you have to go lily as tomorrow saturday and there nothing to wake up early for but you want to go and i understand that so i will see you in the morning he reached over to the hangings and opened them flashing me a smile the room was dark save for the ghostly hued dim light coming in the windows and i found the creases of his forehead and mouth etched with shadows and his impossibly light blue eyes were dancing with a darkness that was uncharacteristic yet matched him perfectly goodnight sirius i said to him boldly i thought and graciously as i hopped from the bed and shut the hangings in a fluid movement it was the simplest thing to say goodnight sirius as if this was dark blue by jack mannequin abc you re shagging him arentyou the whole school and i even had to shake my head as i knew i was not exagerrating in the slighest was at the qudditch match gryffindor tower was completely empty and it was where i found myself thinking to be alone as i sat reading a book it was a ravenclaw versus slytherin game and the gryffindor team was quite anxious to watch seeing what they could pick up on two of the best teams after the game was over there was qudditch practice sirius told me that morning for the gryffindor team and i was surprised that james was finally taking his position as captain seriously i looked up from my book wondering if the boy had been speaking to me when i saw who it was narrowing my eyes and pursing my lips at the unwanted company go to hell remus i said flipping the page in my book and reading on ignoring the laughter that came from him as he stood near the entrance to the common room he didntspeak as he approached the sofa that i sat on and when i looked up again he was standing directly in front of me with his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and the look on his face nothing short of serious pete thinks you re shagging him i think you re shagging him it only a matter of time before the important one thinks you re shagging him too i glared at him knowing that it was on purpose how he conveniently avoided names who i was thought to be shagging and who the important one was and he wanted me to fall into that trap remus lupin was a man of routine he liked to keep his mind games simple and it was funny how i would always end up giving the information he wanted despite the simplicity of his sarcastic manipulative games i not sleeping with him i said casually to the sandy haired marauder who seriousness shot away and a cheeky grin took it place and which him is it that you re not shagging remus asked crudely as he sat down on the couch next to me his shoulder bumping mine and i tossed my book down folding my arms and staring unblinkingly straight ahead i knew that in his own twisted way remus was trying to make a point remus did some things the simplest way possible yet he did some things the hard way just whichever way he enjoyed the most proving his point he enjoyed doing it the hard way dragging it out and making you wonder why you spoke to him in the first place i not sleeping with sirius he went to speak but i continued and i not sleeping with james i dontneed you sitting here telling me that it sad or it pathetic or it miserable that i dontknow which one you re talking about i dontneed you saying that it quite like me or quite like a whore to have more than one boy on her shagging list i dontneed to listen to you remus because i dontgive a damn about you i stood up pulling my hair out of my face and i looked down at remus who in the last few weeks had grown quite scrawny and weary looking i think sirius may have been the only person i knew who seemed healthy anymore i couldntbelieve that this was an acceptable way for people to react to tragedy i couldntbelieve that lives could be so shattered by it i just always liked to think that remus didnthave a heart he had a stubbly beard darker in colour than his sandy blonde hair and the circles beneath his stormy blue eyes told stories that could go on for days he looked gaunt and his cheeks were sunken and i frowned as i observed him wondering if he got more than three hours of sleep a night or any for that matter there was a sort of absolute silence as remus sat with his arms the only thing on him that seemed to have muscle folded over his chest chewing the corner of his mouth and watching me with narrowed eyes i thought maybe i surprised him at times when i was strong and fierce and prepared to go down swinging i wondered if i surprised him then just like he surprised me when he was something other than strong and fierce and prepared when he was kind or caring or gentle you look good he said after a moment looking thoughtful as he studied me further his arms still folded are you happy you look good for a second i considered happiness and i considered the warmth of sirius and i considered the last three weeks it was happiness in a sense i think it could not have been complete happiness it could not have been guilt free happiness because there was that weight knowing that he and i werentright knowing that this was bound to collapse and just maybe i d be left alone again it wasnthappiness but it was freedom there was freedom there was liberty in the bond i had developed with sirius and though i wasntsure i wanted to let that go i knew that i could not be happy until there was that honesty to accompany that freedom with sirius honesty was lacking in every form and with james it seemed it was all honesty and for some reason i missed that no bloody hell no i tugged at my hair sighing and felt the ability to breathe leaving me no i not happy it stupid of me to say that and i always thought it was stupid of other people to say it my mum for example she was never ever happy and she made sure everyone knew she d wander the house in the mornings wearing her silky dressing gown and a pair of slippers and she d drag off of a cigarette and she would tell my father a hundred times over that she wasnthappy and that he d better do something about it well he divorced her but i not happy genuinely when i with him i alright because it so fake yet somehow i can breathe when i with him i took several gulps of the warm dry air of the common room due to the wood in the fireplace burning constantly but you know it d be wrong of me to say i happy when it as if no one else is i couldntimagine that i looked good because i thought i had lost weight and my hair was too long and too curly and my fair skin seemed even more drab and pale in the winter months my eyes stuck out awkwardly from my white skin and i didntlook good i decided because remus lupin was a liar because remus lupin had no heart and i was desperate to convince myself he was the bad guy i not going to call you miserable or pathetic or a whore he tiredly rubbed his eyes and stifled a yawn it was almost three in the afternoon and he was ready to sleep at any moment it worried me a bit to see the condition of things the condition of people lives what all of the secrets did to them i just going to tell you this james has qudditch practice when the pitch is free after the game i nodded as sirius had told me earlier he pressed on you re going to pull that hair from your face and you re going to put some lipstick on and wear a scarf along with that chocolate coloured coat you have you re going to go down to that pitch at six o clock and you re going to throw yourself in his face everything he been missing and you re going to talk to him because if you dont you wont be genuinely happy even if you can breathe or whatever with sirius who says that a good thing maybe with james you cantbreathe because he breath taking to you maybe this is so morally wrong of the two of you and you donthave to say a word to him about sirius not yet just talk to james lily remus stood and i felt myself shrink as he towered over me weary or not he was still somehow golden and good just far too real i think he may need it more than sirius needs you and you always seem to need that little push in the right direction you know right i need a cigarette see you he stood swiftly and left through the potrait hole he had just came through to go smoke his cigarettes and to go be who he always was the boy with the bad intentions but the good heart abc expo 86 by death cab for cutie abc it was that time in the evening when the sun meets the horizon and is just starting to sink below it it hadntyet set it was in some sort of limbo it was twilight the sun was lingering it no longer visible but the sun rays still casting a weak light through the sky a pale yellow meeting the navy and merging pinks and lighter blues slipping in the stars seemed to fade slightly with the stubborn sunlight still flooding onto their territory but it made for an even prettier picture an even lovlier night sometimes it was still hard to believe that we would have to leave hogwarts leave these grounds and that qudditch pitch and our lives as we knew it i didntbelieve that the sky would look like this everywhere we went i didntbelieve the sun set that slowly sunk that lazily anywhere else i think it was just hogwarts magic i think that why we always seemed to have the time to have the accuracy to see that sky after the sun set we all appreciated it too hullo i greeted each member of the gryffindor qudditch team as i approached the pitch and they were headed in the opposite direction brooms thrown over their shoulders cheeks flushed with cold and hair a mess each one of them would offer a nod and smile it wasntthe team i was worried about it was the captain i walked on half heartedly hoping that he had already left and i had missed him though i knew better as he d be the last one to leave after gathering the equipment up the snow covered lawn sloped and i trotted down it my arms folded tightly over me my breath leaving my mouth and seeming to turn white instantly the pitch came into view and though the light at this time in the evening often played tricks on your eyes i knew that it was him that it was his figure walking toward me with his broom too over his shoulder that jolt of hair and that lanky form gave it away before the shadows were even gone off of his face and i was close enough to see him properly three weeks suddenly seemed like forever and i found my pace slowing as i wondered just what i was going to say i wore that chocolate coloured coat remus suggested i wear and instead of lipstick i wore mascara tucked in my pocket was a letter and when i thought of it my hands shook when i thought of him my hands shook pressure lingered to say something right after three weeks of saying nothing at all there was pressure to come up with something solid and honest and strong to say because you would think after so much time to do nothing but brood and dwell on it you would have something to say something that might express a bit of what you ve been feeling i had been so angry and frustrated and i stood there now like some kind of daft girl because he seemed different a bit better i thought seeing his hair impossibly messed up his cheeks and the end of his nose rosy in colour his hazel eyes were bright behind his glasses which faintly reflected the quickly darkening sky and the near full moon he was slightly breathless his chest rising and falling rapidly and his stance was so relaxed and so unlike how i had remembered him tilting my head i put my hands in my pockets waiting for him to approach me and i wondered if he would be able to know it was me through the becoming night like i had known it was him hey he breathed a generous smile cast over his features as he set his broom down on the ground to rub his gloved hands together it lily i told him feeling strange and foreign standing this near to him and a bit stupid for having said my name as if i thought he were stupid yeah who else could it be he asked casually as if there had not been a gap at all between us his smile was cheeky and something i had forgotten of he could smile like that sometimes he had that boyish grace i nodded a few times feeling so ridiulously exposed that i thought i might be falling or drowning it occured to me as i spoke his name for what felt like the first time ever that it could not be anybody but him either not on this starry light swallowing night when everything about him was like it should have always been when he was charming and boyish and washed in the most romantic light possible the moon and the sun rays and the stars all at once it was james and i hated that it really was always going to be james sighing i rubbed my forehead and found myself smiling too though it was sadder than his own was he had been sad the last time i checked hi james just as i said it he ran a hand back through his hair appearing meek for a moment and then that cheeky grin was back in place and he wore it well he was undeniable he was on fire and i didntwant to ruin it with that damned letter in my pocket abc swallowed in the sea by coldplay abc way too long of a wait way too short of a chapter how do i apologize i dontthink i can but i still love and appreciate you all so so much for not giving up completely on me i realize it is ridiculously short and i considered waiting until after the holidays to post it when i ll get a chance to write more but i decided it necessary almost for the chapter to be this short there ll be loose endings tied up in the next few chapters including the letter for lily which i promise does not hold devastating news for her but it news in the least and it just a line i want to finish up perhaps the change in james or so it appears seems impossible as well but i felt it to be right after so long of them not speaking he couldn t ve possibly stayed sad and depressed could have he i will put the lyrics up on my livejournal and i may try to do some review replies but there are just sooo many which i love i dontreally have an excuse for taking so long just school and life and being lousy and uninspired i wanted to mention that i ve been writing this for over a year and i owe that to all of you it amazing that you can get older and grow up yet still stick with something like this so thank you i hope you all have wonderful holidays whatever it is you celebrate christmas hanukkah kwanza and so on thanks for sticking with me kaitlyn chapter 22 lily and james abc the boy who blocked his own shot by brand new abc out here surrounded by nothing but the cold the night and james everything seemed vast the sky quite possibly went on forever those stars the rolling hills and fields they were endless it was startling to feel so small and insignificant it was utterly breath taking to feel as if you could walk right up to the moon take hold of a star and hang on for dear life nothing ever quite compared to the simplicity of the quiet quiet times i spent with james the moments could have been lifetimes yet they were still so fleeting and brief he had made sure the cloak he wore over his quidditch clothes covered his backside and i pulled my coat down over mine as well sitting next to him in the snow sinking in it slightly due to it depth he bent his knees up and draped his arms around them staring up at the sky and all around this pretty picture quivering both from the cold and the nerves i pulled the letter out of my pocket and i handed it to him breathing deeply as he looked at it and then into my eyes as he hadntfor weeks and weeks what this he asked and to the night to this place it was just like he took a breath having not said a word having not disturbed a thing it a letter i said stating the obvious not quite sure what else to say perhaps what i thought of it what i thought was in it what i thought it could mean the owl had flew to one of the windows in the common room shortly after remus had left and pecked at it incessantly until i opened it and accepted the letter from it talons and it was for me my name written across the envelope and hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry written below as if the sender didnttrust the owling system and doubted a simple name would get it there it was from my sister would you read it maybe it from my sister and i just i cantexplain nor help how i get when this happens contact from my family and i just i fall apart a little bit james i was sure i did not need to remind him of my father visit to his house over the holidays he swallowed and slowly removed the folded paper from the envelope turning it over with two of his fingers looking for an instant like the boy i had lost three weeks ago this strong careless charming boy flickered and over his face was everything i remembered james was made of there was guilt i thought playing in his eyes and nostalgia was in the air are you he trailed off hunching his shoulders up against the cold flicked the end of his nose and then continued the guilt was in his voice too are you expecting bad news lily i thought maybe by the tone his voice held and the sullen expression his handsome face was set in maybe i was expecting bad news he seemed to think i was and it had me for a moment until i realized the cause of that evident guilt etched all over him that letter could have been sent to tell me that someone had died or someone was dying telling me maybe that my world was about to crash as james had seemed to a few weeks ago and it was killing him as he sat there clutching it because he did not know he wouldntknow because he had been all but gone to me and he was feeling guilty about that no but then again i never really expecting good news giving it one final look he set it back in my lap and the wind made the corners of the now unfolded paper quiver slightly i dontthink it my place i smacked my lips nodded my head and acted like it did not sting in the least because no after three weeks it almost wasnthis place this wasnthis place here with me just then it took a long time to convince one another that this was his place was my place was our place alright was all i managed as i gathered the letter and the envelope in my hands preparing to stand up and leave him sitting there in the cold lily honestly he said quietly shaking his head and sighing you re quite capable of reading it and it may be good for you to read it i ll james looked up at me and everything about him was somehow alight the soft light of the moon brushed over his face a certain way making him appear vivid and clear and mature whatever it was it caused me to stay sitting there with him waiting for him to finish his trailed off sentence i ll stay here with you though you once asked me not to treat you like you are five and i think reading the letter to you would be doing that you have my full attention though there was a moment in which james breathed loudly and i became very aware of the numbness in my legs it was a bitter sort of cold it penetrated you deeply and the goosebumps on your skin were almost painful times like these i thought were what kept us alive there was something to realize and to hold on to and to take from these moments i began reading the letter aloud slowly articulating each word properly it was dizzying to try to read by such strange dim light that of the moon and the words seemed to intertwine with one another nothing i read really struck me anyway and i thrust the letter back to my lap taking a deep breath so deep my chest ached and looking at the hazel eyed boy to my right james i said passionately and emotionally though i tried to sound anything but i ve missed you and i had because three weeks was an almost intolerable amount of time he seemed like a completely different person and i did not want him to be happy if i could not be happy james did not seem like the type of boy who could find it so easily and i was just wondering what i had missed in those thoughts and in those eyes for three weeks it was startling to have it occur so suddenly there were no preoccupations no books or students or head girl duties out here there was no sirius to distract no bridget to be bitter with there was just james and i had missed him he said nothing for a long time and i would ve thought he hadntheard me if his eyes hadntbeen burning into my own when i told him several times he opened his mouth to speak a flame leapt somewhere within him and then it flickered and faltered and he was quiet once more james shoulders were no less broad than they had been the last time i checked and his hair was still untidy and jet black he was like a familiar song whose words and music were in the back of your mind and you forgot about it and how to sing it until you heard it again and it just falls into place with no effort whatsoever on your behalf being with him and near him was like that i forgot about how it was about who he was and about missing him but just as quickly it had all come rushing back to me and it was a strange yet not so strange comfort for three weeks i just basically sat around his eyes were downcast focusing on the sparkling snow and the remains of a smile played over his lips well you know what i mean i didntlitterally just sit around for three weeks but trailing off he rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses frustrated and then he was suddenly at ease again james leaned back on his elbows and his voice was loud and seemed to resound for miles he looked at me and let his eyes trail up and down me and all over my face as if he was assuring himself this was the right thing either what he was about to say or just being close to me i just tried to figure it out what it is about you that i just cantpull myself away from because you re not whole and you re not steady you re unsure of yourself and of every person in your life and you can be so rude and so awkward but i donteven realize any of that i just look at you and i just think you re lovely and elegant the pause he took was gracious and appreciated and i bit my lip waiting for him to finish waiting for him to sweep me off my feet i ve missed you as well lily with the way his eyes were looking dark and perturbed and with them focusing so hard on the snowy ground i knew that he meant it perhaps more than he had meant anything he had ever said to me before this and he did sweep me off my feet that is it was impossible not to feel an insurmountable rush of affection fondness toward james just then and i wanted to disregard the nagging questions in my mind the day he left he had both called me his girlfriend and told me that i meant nothing to him and i wanted to know which impression i was supposed to have been left with being his girlfriend or meaning nothing i breathed slowly not wanting to speak any further because i found it absolutely unnecessary with us are you alright with what you read he asked resuming his original position his arms over his bent up knees and offering a casual glance to the letter in my lap which i then placed back in the envelope and inside of my pocket they sold the house i said repeating the words i had read but had not been aware of until he asked me it took a moment for the impact to it and then i felt slightly winded my eyes watered though it was more from lack of blinking than it was crying i wasntsure how to be sad over something i was meant to miss when it was something i had lost ages ago a home it strange i muttered feeling james eyes on me and him shift next to me sitting closer just that i donthave a place to go home to now it real yeah when we graduate i ll really have to start a life get a job let go with a sigh that was on behalf of both of us james gave my shoulder a squeeze and then stood bending to pick his broom up and preparing to go to dinner you let go long ago lily there was no continuation and it was for me to decide whether he was talking about my family my house my compassion and love for them or him and me and whatever it was we were doing i thought it was both it s cold i going to eat some dinner and dontstay out too much longer alright i will see you later without waiting for so much as a nod from me he turned and trudged through the snow towards the castle and i found it actually physically hurt to see him turn his back on me as he had the day he left in that carriage because even if i didnthave a house a roof over my head somewhere to return to when this hetic ride was over i did have a place to call home i thought and that had been james and i was tired of watching people walk away abc it was eight o clock i knew more from the feel of the hour than by the actual time on the clock and i lay on my bed which was still neatly made i felt like closing my eyes now going to sleep at this time may be something like surrendering it was early it was eight o clock the hour i so often dwelled on and it was sad a bit that i had nothing better to do on a saturday evening the letter lay on my night stand unfinished and proudly so i did not care to finish it i did not need to know anything else just then all i really knew was guilt anyway there was no longing or remorse no sudden need for my family my sister my mother my house there was instead gnawing guilt because i was there thinking so intently on kissing james potter again it seemed to make things nicer when miserably earlier that morning i had been kissing his best friend earlier that morning and the night before a week before that remus had told me not to mention sirius just to go and talk to james and i had and it seemed to succeed well enough though there seemed to be a lingering doubt an exhaustion between us despite his surprising charm and good nature i did not want to strain it further i did not want to even speak anymore of the three weeks in which james potter barely existed to me i found it pathetic and clich and needy of me but i just wanted to be with him then guiltly or not i just wanted to be near him for as long as possible as if to remind myself he was real and good and there it wasntsomething that lasted though we came and went to one another on and off again i was stifling a yawn when the door to the dormitory opened with a creak and i went to reach for my hangings going to pull them shut so i wouldnthave to endure conversation with anybody i thought it sad that i could actually function like that that i much rathered lying alone in my own large bed than talking to someone who may be able to offer some insight on my ponderings the only person i thought that could fix this and perhaps return me to some state of normalcy was james potter but there was that dependency i hated so badly in reality the only person who could fix any of this was myself and i was just far too unwilling to do it ah dontgo hiding lily i heard him say as he tugged the hangings open before i could fully close them and i was so startled i just lay there completely still and wide eyed i wore a pair of navy pajama pants that were riding low on my hips what with all of the twisting and turning i did to get comfortable and a white tank top that was lifted up to my rib cage as i had been trailing my hand over the skin of my stomach it was a comfort issue and that the first thing i said to james as i forced myself into action sitting up slightly and pulling the shirt down he shrugged and with a sly smirk told me he had no problem with that issue of mine then his smirk faded my initial panic faded and not so suddenly there was just james and me just lily and james more looking for something to preoccupy himself with he reached for the hem of my shirt and yanked it back up touching the skin of my stomach near my navel and though his hands were warm goose bumps instantly prickled over my body and i shuddered taking his hand away and holding it in my own the aching familiarity of the situation to the one we had found ourselves in the day he told me jocelyn died melted that guilt and that doubt and the something between us returned instantly and though i hated nothing seemed to change between us there was always a bed and a dorm and some overwhelming moment of silence i could not turn him away now or ever really kissing him was something i had hoped to have down to a skill by now but when his lips covered mine expecting a response i could do nothing but awkwardly reach for him and hold my arms around his back very tightly he rested his full weight on top of me and i bent my right leg up so it wouldntbe crushed by him almost hooking it around his waist i felt for a moment like i was suffocating beneath him being buried by the satisfying weight of his warm body and if that was the case i thought this is how i want to die james shifted easing the pressure on me and i found i could breathe again just as my hands found his hair i threaded my fingers through it tugging gently as he kissed me and kissed me and never seemed to tire of it he could have been doing it his whole life i decided as his teeth grazed my lip and suddenly the kisses were deeper and longer and it wasnt like this in romance novels this wasntsome cheap alcohol induced moment this was james and this was what we did he tasted of something sweet chocolate perhaps and peppermint when he pulled away for breath though it was me who was quietly gasping he let out a small groan as i continued to thread and tug at his hair knowing that with him that was his comfort issue it wasntlong it wasntgoing to lead to anything and it wasntlove it was good and ended quickly as he rolled off of me coming to lay on my left side as if that had been his intention in the first place and his mind miscalculated where he would end up when he tried to move arentyou cold he asked in a low deep voice before pulling a face and toying with the strap of my tank top i felt like my whole body was flushed with heat and thanks to him no i wasntvery cold not really i said with a shrug quite an understatement really i rolled over onto my side facing him and twisted nearer to him tangling our legs together and splaying my hand out over his chest i could feel his heart beat drumming against my awaiting fingers and i repeated the rhythm it followed silently in my head a strong steady rhythm his face was tucked away in the crook of my neck near my shoulder he pressed his lips to the skin and opened his mouth against it not kissing just letting his warm mouth rest there i shut my eyes feeling lethargic and as if i was under the influence of a powerful medication well i suppose that could have been james for a long time we were quiet and motionless and i thought perhaps he was never going to leave and we would never have to talk or think about or discuss those three terribly empty weeks without him but then he pouted his lips and placed a quick wet kiss to my neck pulled away from me and laid on his back staring upwards i realized as i watched him from the few inches he had put between us that even now with him so close to me physically i had never felt more alone there was a brief moment in which i felt as if i were viewing a stranger through a window and that he was somehow untouchable i had spent the majority of the weeks without him in sirius bed forgetting of him and forgetting of the friendship and losing complete touch with him and that was just very apparent to me now there had been a space created between us long ago that unidentifiable gap in our lives from where we came from and we had succeeded in widening that space letting more life seep in before we could before i could secure him as my own do you ever wonder he seemed to sigh as he rubbed a hand over his face surrendering to the obvious weariness of the evening and the situation if we could make it work outside of this bed or outside of just you and me i told him sitting up and moving away from him that no i didn t i didntreally concentrate on working outside of just us and i never considered another living soul at times and i told him that i knew he did think about it and i knew he did not think we could make it work a long heavy silence followed and i sat with my legs pulled tight against my chest my arms hugging them to me and my chin resting atop them it just seems such a hard concept that there are other people besides us i heard him inhale slowly and the pause he took before speaking was only such because he was holding his breath and i looked down at him with a frown causing him to exhale loudly he was long and dark against the ruby red duvet on my bed his black as coal hair stuck out vividly on the white pillow he had fluffed and put beneath his head and his feet were practically hanging off the end of the bed as he stretched out and somehow appeared calm and alert at the same time he looked as if he didntbelong there next to me yeah was his first word a quick murmur and then he pulled me down so i was laying again and he kept me close by pressing his hand against the small of my back every inch of his body flush against my own you re right there really nothing like this is there he finished rhetorically james kept very still letting his hand drift down over my hip and then up into my hair as he kissed me again slowly and lazily and with remarkable thoroughness he moved the hand he had on my back gripping my chin with his thumb and forefinger dragging my mouth away from his own i tried not to turn my head and he took the time to stare into my eyes which he said were simply green because he could not think of any other colour to do them justice jade perhaps but he just wasntsure as we lay there i thought about winter ending and about the seasons to come and in my mind it became a warmer month july perhaps and there was a haziness to the mid afternoon sky the heat making it seem like it might just melt away the sky was a pale yellow colour not the light blue you were used to that far into july there was no breeze and the day was hot and heavy almost suffocating you if you dared do anything but just sit there and breathe i realized swearing i could almost smell the sweet aroma of a summer afternoon that i wanted to have that with james i wanted to have sun and to have humid days with him i wanted to kiss him and taste the sweet yet tart remnants of lemonade on his lips and to have his arm around me as we relaxed watching the sun set late in the evening i figured it was something perhaps it was me opening up perhaps it was me finally admitting i doubted there was any getting away from this from these feelings i felt that maybe if we were able to get away from these grey bland days of winter maybe there was some happiness in the summer in the sun in that lovely time of year i believed so terribly that there was what are you thinking about james asked sounding genuinely curious as i opened my eyes i hadntrealized were closed any other time i would not have told him but things seemed to change when we were like this when his face was that close to my own summertime i told him in a whisper for fear of that if i spoke of it too loudly it may never come finding myself actually surprised by the dark of the room because the picture i had in my mind of july had been so decevingly real and i did not believe that this was still january even if february wasntfar off and that was it for the night as he closed his eyes with a bit of a smile and sleep met us both so early in the evening abc i will follow you into the dark by death cab for cutie abc the week that followed proved to be a difficult one head duties had become impossible to ignore and i was suddenly forced to be concerned about my grades and classes again i d often wonder why i was taking potions when i was in the midst of a class with professor slughorn and i grew to believe that i was taking it for a break i was taking that class just so i had a bit of a release from the rest of the chaotic days and the parties slughorn would sometimes throw was just a small price to pay for some piece of mind once in awhile working james potter back into my schedule didnthappen for much of that week i saw him in class when i couldnttalk to him and i never once came across him at a meal the same time i was it didntmake much sense to sit and to talk and to wonder whether we could potentially function around other people and then avoid doing just that i wouldntapproach him with the other marauders around even if i would have seen him because they seemed to be at odds with me though the only one who sort of deserved to be was sirius what we had never made much sense to me and i found that i didntreally want it to anymore the pride that he sirius often offered seemed to have rubbed off on me because whenever i felt bad or like i should go and talk to him i d just flip my hair over my shoulder and think that i should let him come to me if he was angry it was obviously because he felt something for me and though that was supposed to have been resolved i felt proud because he just couldntseem to let go when dinner time on friday the thirty first of january had rolled around i was exhausted with doing homework all night or giving up on that and just sitting on my bed staring in the direction of the night stand knowing that there was an unfolded letter there with smoldering words that were awaiting their finish i was just going to throw it out was what i kept telling myself but lies are a bit of a comfort for the weak that friday night instead of sitting in the dorm once again that was either too cold or too stifling i had a quick supper just enough to say i ate and wandered outside down to the pitch the word at the gryffindor table was james had been outside coming up with plays for the quidditch team to practice and the only thing then i could think of doing was spending time with him it funny how you dontrealize how much you ve missed something or someone until you ve got it back and he was there of course but not high up in the sky as i had expected him to be i expected to trudge to the pitch through the snow and stand there with my neck craned watching that messy haired boy who had flew away with my heart he appeared nothing more than an abstract sort of splotch against the undisturbed fresh fallen snow from where i was as if a bed of flowers was blossoming through the snow but instead of appearing bold and bright coloured it was just a dark tangly mass the only colours amongst the dark ones were scarlet and gold his gryffindor scarf while a part of me wanted to immediately assume he was dead or had fell from his broom and broke his back another part of me knew better than that and that part of me was the one that put the smile on my face as i walked at a leisurely pace toward the boy who was spread eagled in the snow his eyes were closed his chest rising and falling slowly and the setting sun light was cast over him graciously shadows stretched over his face seeming to enhance his features and though the glow was of a heavenly sort it never occured to me there was a dark essence to him that evening and i decided the shadows sort of completed him and then it became apparent to me as i stood there looking down at james potter and feeling somehow infinite the two of us from here on out were always going to be lily and james and it struck me oddly as the world outside of us slipped away into a vague memory and it was just the two of us in the middle of a quidditch pitch completely alone it felt nice to be alone sometimes laying in the snow getting your clothes all sodden catching your death of cold finally lost your mind have you i asked him airily taking a few steps toward his form so that i was standing just at his side at such an angle that he had become totally covered by shadow no but i d appreciate it if you d keep quiet for a bit he replied after a second in a voice so serious that i witheld my laughter growing impatient i went to speak again but james sighed loudly and opened his eyes telling me to lay next to him if i wanted to understand what he was doing i did so grumbling as the cold wet snow dampened my jeans though my coat was heavy enough that it didntsoak through it now just listen it sounds almost like thunder he made a content sort of sound and rested his hands on his stomach to make room for me right next to him what is it that sounds almost like thunder i asked squinting over at him the sun wasntthat strong but it reflected off the snow almost blindingly your heartbeat if you just commit yourself for a minute you d hear it automatically it completely overwhelms every other i hushed him holding my breath for a second and tried to listen for my heart drumming beat resounding in my ears as if it were the most important thing in the world i was aware of my heartbeat but i just didnthear it as he described it there was no thunder for me so instead of listening as we laid there i wondered i wondered just why this was so important to him i wondered why his broomstick was no where to be seen and i wondered why he seemed to crave this sometimes as well this absolute solitary the moment seemed to pass and he turned to look at me before sitting up i told him that i admired him for being able to just lay and listen to his own heartbeat despite the fact i wasntsure why i even found it admirable in the first place he just shook his head full of messy shaggy jet black hair and smiled a cheeky warm smile and for a long moment i saw summer in his eyes and that was the thing that made me accept his impulsive desperate proposal of ignorance and being together abc possession by sarah mclachlan abc it was in a quiet way in a tone that he tried to keep at a whisper but his voice would crack from what i liked to think was this passionate deposition that he asked me to forget about what had happened to turn a blind eye to the weeks we went without talking to the night he left and when he said i meant nothing to him ignorance is bliss they say yeah so let forget about it all act as if it never happened at the time i knew it was the worst idea possible for this situation but with his eyes that warm hazel colour with some foreign highlights in them that almost resembled honey i couldntrefuse anything he would say even if he had been doubting us and our ability to be anything around other people we could move on i think and we could be happy and together and all of those ridiculously overused things there were two powers just then swaying my response james summer eyes and the bitter cold of the evening and of the snow laying there in the snow was some sort of strange reality and staring into his eyes offered possibility the future here we could be happy and together here i spend most of my time starving for some freedom to get out of here i ve never needed it like this before but after almost seven years i think it catching up to me i need out and i cantoften think of anything else it you and leaving that on my mind most of the time what would be different about us making it official the nights spent in one another bed would be more frequent i sat up too knowing there was snow in my hair and knowing my nose was red and knowing that i could very well fall apart in front of him right then but too determined and curious to leave why dontyou just say yes and why dontyou just be my girlfriend lily it was a small step i thought to everyone else in the entire world but to us it was monumental almost and i actually caught myself tilting my head and staring at him thinking he might tell me he loved me we always seemed a bit beyond that though it wasntoften that i found myself hanging around considering the way i felt about james i knew how i felt about him and i knew how he felt about me and it was something we didntspeak of for a long long time it just came upon us and we fell into it and there was nothing as natural as this nothing almost regretting it almost knowing the outcome of it before i d even said it i folded my hands in my lap and i bent my head down not looking into his face as i said it and i told james potter i d be his girlfriend even though i hated the label something classier would be nice the grin on his face was welcome and unmistakable as we sat there together each of us cross legged and each of us cold and wet it was something i mused that there had been betrayal and weeks and letters unfinished yet here we were it didntseem important then none of it did james hands were warm and he rested them on my thighs leaning close and staring at my lips for a full minute before kissing them slowly as if it were an occupation of his for which he got paid very well there would never be anything like this happy or sad alive or dead we were stupid and hopeless aware and lethargic loving and bitter we were decidedly lily and james and then it all we thought we would ever need abc okay so this chapter didnttake as long to get up as the last it actually doesntfeel like that long at all because i ve actually been working on it so steadily i litterally just finished it and i realize it 1 30 in the morning where i live and i should consider things and read through them better before just uploading them but it part of what i enjoy about writing i hope you like it and i hope you will enjoy this sickeningly sweet happiness for who knows how long it will last you are all amazing readers and reviewers and i would obviously be nothing without you thanks so so much lyrics on my livejournal as usual kaitlyn chapter 23 misery loves company abc good news by something corporate abc we turned in early that night at least from one another as james had a quidditch game the next morning at 9 o clock and it was no good for the captain to show up exhausted so we walked back to the castle awkwardly wondering whether to reach for the other hand or not and by the time we arrived at the foot of the staircase leading to the girls dormitory we hadnteven spoke let alone touched one another it was he who broke the inevitable silence though not by speaking by running a hand back through his hair and grinning at me in a way that might be considered bashful but when it was coming from him and directed to me well it was just charming unbelievably charming good luck in the morning alright i smiled so widely that my cheeks hurt after a moment it wasntan unpleasant feeling you re coming to watch it was a statement not a question at which i laughed shaking my head a bit i did not like quidditch for the first couple of years at hogwarts it was a kind of a given to be amazed by it and to support your house team but after more than six long years of going through the same old house rivalries i was growing tired of it i was growing tired of it and of hogwarts and of so many aspects of this life now and again i found myself dying for that simple muggle life i had once led there was none of this dying none of this flying none of this falling this falling in love in life in lies i was just a little girl when i left that world and i wondered if it changed much they always say for one reason or another that you cantgo home and i never really understood it until i tried it over the holidays seeing that for sale sign on the lawn knowing that the house was now sold you really cant go home because you change so much that it painful no i afraid i not coming to the game you d ve thought i had slapped him or called him a particularly rude name by the look on his face he looked positively ashamed of my existence for a moment and then he held his head high and raised his eyebrows demanding in such an airy tone that i wasntsure it even was a demand yes you are abc there are worse people in the world i thought as i made my way to breakfast early that saturday morning the sky was grey yet there was the distinct offering of sunlight it was february 1st i realized and we were entering the final stages of winter lately it had been so close spring it had been so close that you could smell it easily wafting through the cold stale winter air we needed that to survive maybe needed to know that there was something different something warmly familiar on the horizon because somedays it was like we would live in this slow dark season for the rest of our lives but there are worse things than winter and there are worse people in the world than remus lupin the first time i thought it it felt like i was convincing myself of it rather than just simply thinking it he was there at breakfast with the morning prophet sitting alone at the middle of the table though there were people here and there at the ends it was as if he created his own barrier his own little bubble and not a soul could penetrate that i stood there chewing the inside of my mouth seriously wondering whether he may have come up with some magical force to keep people away and seriously wondering what would happen to me if i dared to sit down by him he intimidated me sometimes not all of the time and not often but sometimes times like these when he looked so grown up and beyond the rest of us he intimidated me what with his paper and his coffee and the premature wrinkles on his forehead i thought he might have lived many lives and it impressed me remus impressed me with his intimidation and i was such a stupid girl when it came to him i d really like it if you d stop looming over my shoulder and if that means you have to sit down then so be it just quit hovering he startled me and it was obvious as he rolled his eyes and laid his paper down looking at me and my slumped shoulder posture my barely brushed hair and my wide eyed stare i sat down next to him and glanced at him out of the corner of my eye he had picked his prophet back up and absent mindedly reached for the pitcher of juice passing it to me as if he were a polite boy who did this often i thanked him poured the juice in my goblet and was sipping on it slowly when he spoke in a casual murmur there ve been more attacks according to this he drew my attention with this and i turned to him frowning as i continued to drink and he continued talking in that cool nonchalant tone as if this were an every day occurance hmm they re getting more frequent more violent and more deadly lovely news that is it struck me then with a small smile to my face that likely made me appear a touch insane after the news he just delievered that there were indeed worse people in the world than remus who in fact might just become one of the best during these tough tough times swallowing a bit of pride or perhaps a bit of uncertainty i bit my lip and looked around to be sure that i was right in thinking neither sirius nor peter were going to show up soon they say misery loves company remus cocked an eyebrow at me his expression blank and his mouth set straight i continued looking away from the sandy haired disaster so how bout you and i go watch that damned quidditch game together abc we left the castle a bit early for the game because we were both quite set on avoiding a crowd of laughing cheering people sometimes it was just nice to be quiet sometimes it was just nice to have someone there with you during that quiet whether that someone be a lover or an once enemy i shoved my hands in my pockets squinting as the sun now brighter and stronger reflected off of the snow and glared into my eyes the sun i thought what an odd thing it would be a pleasure to feel warmth again as i thought i stopped walking for a moment as remus was a few steps behind me anyway and i just wanted to feel this unforgettable atmosphere i closed my eyes and just breathed a bit it was quite something this place called hogwarts there was snow faded grass wind and the sun all at once enough to envigorate the senses all of which seemed to have gone numb and forgot of sweet aromas and warmer days and i thought maybe we all changed with the seasons then with no warning or reason at all i felt a gentle thud against my back and something damp was splattered onto my coat a snowball i turned around and looked at remus with a furrowed brow and a sort of disbelieving smile as he shrugged his shoulders dropped the remainder of the snow he had in his hand and walked ahead of me god lily he said a bit mockingly you donthave to be so serious all the time when he turned around he was smiling a crinkly eyed smile it was startling actually to the point that the smile fell from my own face and i just stared at him my hands at my sides how different how better he looked when he grinned like that a vibrance sprung into his features and he looked like such a boy such a child his eyes had a sort of glint to them a sort of life that i never really knew remus was capable of there was a relief about those lovely blue eyes an unfamiliar thing they were framed by a set of thick pale lashes yet he was still somehow the epitome of masculinity just then he was tall and lean and his sandy brown hair was mussed up thanks to the wind remus was a breath of fresh air i thought as i walked forward and grasped his gloved hand in my own tugging him along toward the pitch abc the evening had faded swiftly and gracefully like it did at this time of year the night began to press in around us offering it blind comfort and i thought it was funny how your senses seemed to heighten at night your eyes adjust to the expanse of black sky and you seem to hear every single thing things that may seem normal during the day are now potentially terrifying and you sit there with your heart racing trying to calm yourself and forget about it forget about the noise and the looming shadows and how inadequate you feel in the dark you blink and widen your eyes and try so hard to see just a bit further because what if there something or someone there you pull the covers over your head or if you re outside you donteven breathe as you strain to hear what you think is the inevitable mad man with an axe standing just behind you my imagination always ran a bit wild during dark starless nights like these and that why i didntunderstand my love for them i didntunderstand how i could find myself sitting high up in the quidditch stands with a boy i hardly liked the only light in the smothering darkness was the the dull orange glow of the end of his cigarette and faroff lights in the windows of the castle funny i thought how that castle appeared years away from here do you want a drag or somethin remus offered the cigarette from his mouth sounding as if this was a last resort as we had just been sitting and he had been smoking and the silence had been swallowing no i shook my head my gloved hands gripping the bench i sat on positioned on either side of my legs do you want your own he asked sounding perplexed and going to pull his pack from his pocket but i stopped him by shaking my head again and laughing softly is it so hard to believe that i just want to sit here with you silence or not through the dark i imagined he was raising his eyebrows at me and he was sitting close enough that i could feel him shrug his shoulders each to their own i suppose you re really holdin on to this misery loves company thing arentyou remus asked it like he thought it was something i was clinging to like it was all that i had the tone of his voice could ve been a bit gentler than what he normally used but perhaps he was just trying to suit the night like i was if you were too loud you couldnthear all of those noises that drove you partially insane if you were too loud you couldntenjoy this fleeting pause from the rest of your life gryffindor had won the quidditch game against hufflepuff which seemed somehow irrelevant to me and even to him we had sat and we had watched the whole thing cheering and shouting yet now that it was over it just seemed a way to pass the time a way to recognize that things were slowly but surely drawing to their end we parted at dinner he disappeared when i went to the great hall starving due to the fact i had missed lunch remus had the right idea though because the whole table was full and praise for the team never ceased james was enjoying it and i sat near him not next to him because he was crowded enough as it was glad that he was grinning so damned widely i hadntspoke to him since the night before and as the celebration continued after dinner i didntreally expect to remus had made his emergence at the party in the gryffindor common room only to clap his friend on the back as congratulations give a nod to sirius who had consumed so much alcohol he had people wondering where this large stock of his was kept and declare he was going for a smoke he didntinvite me he didntsay a thing to me but his gaze passed over me as he tugged his coat on and straightened his lapels and i found that invitation enough it was something after nine as we sat there and smoke blew from his mouth the grey of it contrasting with the dark sky and i leaned my head back watching it float up and away from us i wondered why he started smoking he had his eyes shut and he rubbed the bridge of his nose as the cigarette stuck from the corner of his mouth it illuminated his face in an odd sort of way and the shadows that played over his features didntseem much out of the ordinary it was as if remus lupin was always hidden by shadows or secrets or something mysterious like that why are you out here i asked him quietly folding my hands in my laps and staring out over the pitch and the grounds leading up to the castle i was sure i could see a figure moving with ease through the dark remus sighed and didntanswer i thought he might state the obvious he was smoking but he didn t because that really wasntthe reason why he was out here any other time he would want a smoke he d just open a window in the boys dorm and stick his head out of it there was something on his mind i observed silently and i had a feeling a horrible burning sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that it had something to do with me and james he knew i realized and it was supposed to be such a nice lovely thing to have declared a relationship with james potter but i felt a bit sick when i thought about anybody finding out under the circumstances under these complicated twisted circumstances i was afraid remus may make me regret it i dontknow the same reason you are i think came his murmured reply after a minute or two he had leaned back and stuffed his hands into the pocket of his coat having trodden on the cigarette and thrown it down over the side i parted my lips and took a deep breath of the cold stinging air and let it back out slowly things were frost covered and motionless and this could have been magical i thought if there were stars to be seen if the moon wasntmore than a sliver and if the boy sitting next to me wasntremus remus stood up as a noise issued from below and he gave me a long hard stare directly in the eye he was unblinking and lean and undeniably attractive as he spoke stirring something stange within me i hope it worth it you know lily remus paused and drew himself up to his full height as he breathed in deeply and released it as a sigh he flipped his collar out to shield him a bit more from the cold and he dug his hands deeper in his pockets looking as if he were trying to bury himself away inside of his coat the two of you getting together he was sure to avoid calling it a relationship as if both of us were far too different or far too ridiculous to be involved in one especially together because it just so mixed up isntit yeah i honestly do hope it worth it does sirius know i asked in a hushed voice my eyes wide my body tense as it was evident somebody was climbing the up the stand to join us remus laughed not bothering to keep it quiet james isntstupid lily of course sirius doesntknow to my dismay remus sat down again as james of course appeared a strange cutout against the night hey he greeted us breathlessly taking his wand out lighting it and grinning cheekily bloody cold out here why d you leave the festivities he gave off the vague impression of a boy who had drank just enough alcohol to make things a bit dim and fuzzy and he seemed to just glow with warmth from the apples of his crimson cheeks down to his unfastened cloak and bare hands i dontknow remus said slowly with lidded eyes and lethargic movements why d you leave james grin widened and his eyes seemed to light up a bit but that could ve just been the beam from his wand oh well i didntwant to he moved his shoulders as if he were trying to get comfortable and then he plopped down on the seat next to me putting myself in the middle of the two marauders see things are just getting interesting it funny because it usually the slytherin beatings we celebrate but now we celebrate anything hufflepuff included peter just fell off the wagon member how he said he wasntgoing to drink anything ever again after what sirius did to him the last time he passed out i looking forward to this again then why d you leave if things are just getting interesting remus continued their conversation sounding as if he were about to fall asleep whereas james sounded like he was raring to go all night i wanted to come see lily james said simply and that was answer enough for remus who didntspeak further after that james laid his wand which was still lit down on the seat and it managed to provide a bit more light than remus cigarette had it an effortless move james put his arm around me draping it over my shoulders and the slight weight it offered was warm and satisfying everything about him sometimes was warm and satisfying but i found him especially endearing when he was like this drinking and charming and nonchalant as hell just as a contented sort of sigh left my lips i turned my head to look at james and though i thought since we seemed absolutely made for each other i was particularly optimistic that night for some reason that he may meet my gaze halfway and we d share a sweet affectionate smile he didn t he was staring straight ahead and i could see the glowing light the torches in the castle offered reflected in both the lens of his glasses and in his breathtaking hazel eyes it was as good as a smile i figured i then turned to look at remus almost feeling that stormy blue stare of his and was right in my thinking it wasntan intent sort of look it was just one that said he was observing me observing us and he just seemed so tired suddenly as if the day had been far too long for him to endure and just as i opened my mouth to suggest he go inside he stood up and called james attention listen i ve got a girl to meet so i ll see you two later he offered a slight grin and a wink to james and then he made the trek back toward the castle leaving the two of us sitting there as if we were in our right minds james squeezed my arm slightly and i looked away from remus retreating form wholeheartedly appreciate of james relaxed and smiling features not jealous are you lil dontbelieve him remus likes boys i chuckled softly finding myself leaning in closer to him as if somehow drawn to the boy and that unidentifiable aroma that wafted over me and my senses each to their own i murmured in reply repeating the words remus had said to me but a few minutes before and i swaying gently until my head came into contact with his lovely broad shoulder and it was apparent to me all i was capable of all that i could accomplish then was breathing to just breathe because james potter was possibly everything i d ever know or want or see that night it didntmatter much that remus knew about us because what fun would it be if nobody knew and sirius was as good as forgotten between the two of us it felt and it was so strange to me so unbelievably strange to me how complete i felt for even a brief moment or two it was as if things were going to be just fine there was reassurance wrapped up in james and the dark sky and it was comfort blind blind comfort abc breathe 2 am by anna nalick abc hi well okay i didnt mean to finish this chapter it just kind of finished itself that sounded riciulous but it true oh my goodness it s quite short i just felt so odd and inadequate after february began and my exams ended i just felt the need to write something good and fresh and just try to motivate myself and move on a bit so that what this chapter is it motivation it this ray of sunshine if you will it a nice slow chapter and things are just building a bit i know it might not seem like there a lot to look forward to after this chapter ended but lily has to deal with the sirius issue and lily has to deal with the fact that james told remus there wasnta lot of depth about that and yeah i always tire myself out when i try to justify my writing lol god i just like writing about lily and james together even if they re just sitting together as always you guys are the best most amazing reviewers ever i love and appreciate you all so much and you may grow weary of reading my monotonous thanks but i dontknow what else to say you guys keep me going and please continue and as usual the lyrics will be on my livejournal all the best kaitlyn chapter 25 everything not lost abc amsterdam by coldplay abc i haventbeen this lonely since ray died she had appeared behind me as i sat down to breakfast wednesday morning staring over at the tables where students were giving and receiving gifts and cards bridget had been like that lately abrupt and honest and everybody but her seemed to notice how depressing it was on sunday when she heard what had happened between the black brothers she asked me if i was alright before saying lucky nobody died and it was a bit extreme i thought but she seemed quite serious perhaps that what your mind does though after someone you love dies maybe all you can think of are the worst things i couldntimagine how destructive it must ve been and i felt terrible for her that morning as she stood there looking quite hopeless but somehow determined with her dark hair pulled back and her fringe pinned up away from her face i wasntsure how someone so angry someone who seemed to have had given up on absolutely everything i wasntsure how she could look so lovely with her pink lips and alabaster visage dark eyes and high cheekbones she was as pretty as a picture and she had such potential i thought but all she knew then was that it was valentine day and she was all alone it just some stupid holiday i said sliding down the bench to make room for her nothing much to fuss about the fireworks might be nice tonight though saying nothing she ate some egg and toast and she knew that i was trying very hard to not care about it to be as passive as possible because i refused to have any expectations for james it was just another day another cold bleak day and there would be fireworks tonight and that was enough as i looked up to the ceiling of the great hall acting as the sky i saw the slightest offering of blue behind grey clouds and as i left for my first class i wondered what form hope would come in if it could come in one i wondered if sunlight blue skies and spring would bring hope to all of the miserable people all of the hardworking people and all of the uncertainty for a moment i was sure it would abc word had gotten around about myself and james the head boy and girl and oh how ideal was that it wasntsurprising that people were interested in james because it was a blatant fact james potter was popular good looking and talented and an arrogant prat at times it wasnta wonder that in his early years at hogwarts he would strut around the place hexing people and boasting about his detentions and somehow he had become head boy and it was wonderful to think he could change so drastically but still keep his core it was hard to believe someone was capable of that sort of self revelation it was midday and i dwelled in the dormitory thinking to myself and wary of setting off down to lunch because word had gotten around about the two of us i felt well slightly more embarrassed than disappointed that i had yet to receive a word of hello from him let alone a dozen roses there were cupids lurking around every corner and pink decorations floating in the air and it became a bit overwhelming to have people more concerned than i was about whether i received a gift from him or not one girl loudly wondered to her friend as i walked by if i d get a ring from him during the fireworks i surpressed the need to make sure she knew we had barely been together a couple of weeks and he hadnteven looked at me yet that day i was standing in the middle of the room my gaze unfocused and unblinking then my stomach gave a growl and i sighed pulled my hair over one shoulder braided it and left the dormitory defeated the common room was fortunately deserted and i strode through it quickly not paying any mind to my surroundings and pondering what to eat for lunch i thought maybe i should have been more concerned about james and his whereabouts but lunch seemed more pressing right then wotcher lily i spun around knocking my knee hard into a chair and searched for the source of the voice which had came from behind me my long braid whipped into my face as i balanced myself and saw his unmistakable form at the foot of the stairs leading to the boys dorm there was a strange jolt in my gut that had nothing to do with hunger and i wrapped my arms around my middle as he approached me feeling slightly anxious despite the grin upon his face bleeding hell i murmured and he quirked an eyebrow taking this as my greeting as i reached down to massage my throbbing knee and smooth the pleats in my plaid skirt as i straightened up sorry you gave me a start is all sirius grin widened and he always looked terribly handsome in his uniform all buttoned up and with a tie around his neck putting his hands in the pockets of his slacks he looked meek for a moment and then boldly met my eyes they had let him from the hospital wing on sunday afternoon and he didnttalk too much about what happened as one might have expected him to people speculated about it and all remus would say was that he received a month worth of detention for the beating he had gave regulus james hadntsaid anything more about it either since the night it happened from what remus had told me i figured that james had gone to see sirius in the hospital and i worried that his though not entirely uncharacteristic distance with me over the next couple of days was because he found out that i had told sirius about the two of us without talking to him first d you see my bruises i look a bit tough donti and my nose is still kind of massive i wasntsure i had ever seen him more proud and that was saying quite something seeming he possessed more pride than most anyone i knew i think i look tough he repeated and gestured to his nose again and it was protruding a bit more than normal and resembled slightly severus snape nose i d never tell him that and that nose frankly was not a tough look oh i are you all right though i mean i faltered though he never missed a beat and hung on to my incomplete sentence and i wished he wouldn t for i was uncertain of what to say to him you do look tough honestly i said awkwardly figuring it was what he wanted to hear are you hurt though he was shaking his head before i finished my question and he rubbed his stubbly chin while he thought for a moment with a shrug he said i fine and his hands returned to his pockets and there was some underlying tension to it all i felt like he thought i was imposing or about to impose on something he wasntable to deal with so i just told him i was glad he wasnthurt my nose will look normal again i ve to take a potion to keep healing it but it ll be as good as new the bruises would fade soon he said and i wondered why it was suddenly so important to him to look tough why it mattered that he still bore the marks from the fight with his brother when before he would ve wanted them gone as soon as possible i asked him quite slowly and quietly what it had been about what had caused it all and his thick brown hair fell into his ghostly grey eyes as he looked down at his feet there are things happening lily you know he said simply and matter of factly it all about that stuff now he continued and i found myself fiercely hoping regulus looked as worn as sirius did from their encounter i think it far too complicated to really when he trailed off and looked at me i just nodded and didntpress on he was the type of boy who deserved to keep his dignity have you been speaking with james today i ve not seen him yet i asked conversationally and there was a shift in the atmosphere between us and i knew he felt more comfortable with this topic though i didn t when he nodded vigorously i felt a stab of dread but forced a tight lipped smile and pushed my hair behind my ears but very suddenly i felt very bitter i wasntsure if it was toward james or sirius or myself but as i dwelled on it a taste formed in my mouth and i didntknow if it was just my imagination or not but it was foul upon my tongue and the look on my face contorted and then i was grumbling at him oh so i suppose when he speaking to you he not speaking to me i felt so terrible when the two of you were at odds and sick with guilt really but it doesnt matter because it not like the daft sirius cut me off and not in a polite way but by putting his hand over my mouth and raising his eyebrows pointedly at me indicating it best if i quit speaking now listen dontworry about it okay james just isntthe best at this sort of thing all i mean is i watched him destroy a relationship with jocelyn completely unaware of the fact so because he kind of messing up on valentine day doesntmean you should jump to any sort of conclusions i chewed the corner of my mouth when he dropped his hand from my lips and i considered his words abruptly realizing they didntmake me feel any better jocelyn had died was all i thought and for some reason it seemed inappropriate of sirius to even mention her there were no further words passed between us just those of parting and i hugged my arms back around me as i continued out of the common room my mind buzzing and my knee aching and my heart thundering abc thundering i thought stopping in the middle of the corridor and holding my breath it somehow did sound like thunder ringing through my head and my ears and i swore if someone was passing me in the dank hall they d hear it as well i was frantic for a moment deciding i needed to find james and to tell him i had heard my heart sound like thunder like he had that day that day you asked me to be your girlfriend do you remember james i just was walking and heard it and i thought of you instantly rounding a corner as i thought of what i d say to him what i d like to say to him i collided into somebody a somebody with a rather hard chest and i figured it was him or hoped it was him because i just wanted him so desperately then was wondering what you might be up to he murmured as we took our respective steps back from one another and he fixed his glasses as i clenched my clammy hands at my sides oh it didntmatter that he hadntspoke to me until noon on valentine day i thought as i looked to his bespectacled eyes it just some stupid holiday i repeated to myself as i had to bridget that morning it didntmatter that he was a bit incompetent with it all we were so fresh and all that really mattered was that he hadn t hadntdone something drastic i thought but completely unable to tell him any of it the windows to the left filtered in a dull light that washed over us and my hands looked pale and he had never looked so appealing my heart was just thundering i told him rather breathlessly and ashamed of the fact for i didntfind it any fair that he had such an ability to turn me into mush yet he himself could stand there completely unaffected i was sure it meant i was a bit hopeless and not that he was heartless it was so funny i was just walking along and realized it sounded as thunder and i thought i thought of you and then ran into you and i stumbled over my words thinking he d have something to say that he d save me from my floundering but he just stood there and i felt quite helpless as if i were drowning and he would rather watch than recuse he cleared his throat after a minute and the corner of his eyes crinkled as a smile passed over his features relief flooded through me and i moved toward him without waiting to hear anything he might ve had to say instead wrapping myself up in him and breathing deeply against his neck it was a bit before he moved and when he did i found myself in a motion that was quite fluid and graceful pressed against the stone wall and he felt so feverish against my lips the sudden contact with the cool rough stone sent goose bumps along my skin and he seemed to be following them with his fingertips over my legs and neck i didntbelieve he had ever kissed me like this or even thought to kiss me like this before the very moment he did it he was different in that moment james was we were in a corridor and i was pressed against a wall and he had some fascination with my bottom lip one hand rested against the wall beside my face and the other was on my just injured knee that might have been bruised but when he touched it i felt alive and there was something wrong but i couldntcare who could when he was kissing me like that all right lily james said as he pulled away from me in a voice that was slightly deeper than usual but quite composed when compared to my rapid breathing a hand instantly flew to his untidy black hair as we parted from one another and he rumpled it and his cheeks were pink and his gaze was burning i frowned tilting my head as scrutinized him he looked frustrated or angry and as i went to ask him if he was in fact all right he told me my braid was falling out and then asked me to watch the fireworks with him that night i expected a mention of sirius or some indication of what was bothering him but it never came i wordlessly nodded overcome with far too many things to say and he told me he had to be somewhere but he d meet me in the common room at half past eight his footsteps echoed loudly through the hall and even louder in my mind when he was long gone abc a warning sign by coldplay abc i found bridget sitting in the great hall at lunch she was eating chocolates raising my eyebrows curiously i sat beside her and reached for a roll and then a dish with vegetables before i could say anything to her however she popped the top back onto the container of chocolates and offered me to have some when i was finished with my meal who i began but left the question hanging as an honest smile graced her lips and i felt the need to tell her to do it more often but instead just prodded her with my elbow inviting her to go on sirius gave them to me she said and i knew i looked surprised for a moment but bridget just nodded and continued in a tone that was content and light and the furthest thing from depressing he just sort of plopped them down in front of me at the end of breakfast this morning he said he had them and there was no one in particular he wanted to give them to so he thought perhaps i d like them real casual like you know but he looked really really sincere lily i didntfeel like crying for the first time all day i just she smiled again and i would never be able to properly express the rush of appreciation and affection i felt for the boy i think he such a great guy sirius i mean he just is i think i told her after swallowing a few mouthfuls of food and i felt her eyes on me and i realized i spoke of him in a sort of awed tone james asked me to go watch the fireworks with him tonight so so maybe he was just feeling off or something i not sure but you know it doesntseem like such a lost cause yet that good lily i heard her say and i knew both of us were wondering if it was really was just a few days ago i had been sitting with sirius in a dark corridor and he was bruised and beaten and there was a severe doubt over his friendship with james i had thought it was perhaps damaged beyond repair i thought i had finished it off with me admitting my relationship with james to him sirius but now they were speaking and there was no elaboration from either of them they were vague and frustrating and the ceiling in the hall reflected a clear pale blue sky some sort of attempt to break the common cycle of storms and cold and uninviting and i was moody throughout the rest of the afternoon because everything seemed to be a large contradiction abc i holed up in the dormitory which when girls took to readying themselves began to smell of various different perfumes and hair products and became almost choking to breathe in there was a dire need to impress that evening and i never thought to put makeup on let alone bother with my hair james seemed so disinterested in that sort of girls were stupid i decided curled up beneath the covers of my bed with the hangings open as gleeful voices all reassuring one another that their boyfriend would be amazing passed through the dorm oh one of them was bound to get knocked up and perhaps then they would understand that it was useless to rely on a boy that much you sacrifice your independence and your solitude and you re with someone so often that you forget that you are two separate people and when it breaks and falls and shatters you ll be devastated and it so useless to rely on a boy that much to rely on anybody that much it useless i knew and refused to acknowledge it then that i was like that as well i looked at james and there seemed to be the entire world in his eyes and it was so hard for me to detach myself from him it wouldntmake a difference how difficult he was to understand to deal with i grew to rely on him too vastly too quickly to put that much faith in another person is like playing with fire and as i just lay and lay there and thought i had almost talked myself out of even going to the firework show with him but bridget loomed over me at quarter past eight and told me if she was attending then i most certainly was i was lazy with my appearance stroking mascara onto my lashes and putting berry coloured lipstick on combing my hair through with my fingers and dressing in a black sweater jeans and boots i brought gloves and a cloak and i felt my mouth go dry while walking down the stairs to the common room my eyelids fluttered and my hands shook a little when i saw how good he looked standing there in the emptying room in a pair of dark jeans and a brown coat which his hands were shoved in the pockets of the hearty glow of the fire washed over him and he was somehow enhanced better than maybe ever i hoped he wouldntopen his mouth and ruin the sight of him i hoped he d just be quiet throughout the show and maybe just hold my hand and let me believe in something he took a deep breath and i expected words of something but instead he just absolutely grinned and let the breath back out in a bit of a satisfied hello every thought in my head was mixed up and tumbling around and i didntknow what to think of him so i just kissed his cheek almost shyly and kept a few steps ahead of him as we left through the portrait hole it all suddenly seemed quite doomed but romantic perhaps doom was romantic though an imminent heartbreak held all of the romantic potential in the world if you were one to think like that it was at that stage when you still had time for salvation and that seemed the most inspiring thing of all the staircases and passages were full of students and some professors keeping watch heading out to the grounds at least fireworks in the wizarding world were more flashy and creative than the ordinary ones muggles used it didntseem quite as commonplace because of that and there was even a murmur of excitement amongst the crowd as we made our way en masse through the castle i became very aware of the all of the people around us i felt as if we were being strictly judged put on some sort of display for we had never been as a couple with this many people before rumors and whispers had been easy to deal with simply because we were never together outside of the dorm or outside of the gryffindor common room where no one really cared i slowed my pace and looked over my shoulder to where james was and he seemed to sense whatever it was coursing through me worry or need or something because he caught my hand in his own before i could turn back around and i tried not to look at him again as we continued on our way it felt strange to be do something as innocent and intimate as holding hands when we had always been so frenzied abc upon descending the stone steps that led up to the heavy oak doors i stilled for a moment with closed eyes and breathed the cool brisk air was calming and refreshing and invigorating just like the warmth of a fire is relaxing and makes you drowsy the only students outside to watch the fireworks were some of the sixth and seventh years though the younger ones would definitely have a good view from up inside the castle there were only a couple of professors outside standing on the steps and away from the students most who were trudging through the thin layer of snow toward the lake to watch from there over here then james gestured to the pack of our classmates huddling together and watching the sky over the lake as if they might fail to make a sound and we would miss out on something he took his hand back from me and blew on them before pulling his gloves on and i followed suit we stood awkwardly for a few moments craning our necks up as if we d have to strain to see bursts of light and colour in the dark sky there was a strange feeling of anticipation in the air and it was either comforting or childish that we were still able to enjoy something as simple as this i felt serene almost too at ease but inside of me there was an unpleasant restless wave churning his stare was on me not on the sky and i could feel them so intensely so avidly and i could not look at him my eyes were stinging when the first firework burst and i blinked a few times suddenly struck with how clear absurdly clear the night was there were stars and i would ve been content with just sitting and staring at them another particularly fancy one went whirring into the sky and there was a collective intake of breath and it wasnteven absolutely pitch black out it was a more of a navy night and the various colours just looked more appropriate against such a backdrop wisps of white cloud floated without menace and you could see the sky reflected almost exactly in the still lake i found myself watching the water more than anything and after each explosion colour and dazzling effects spent themselves into the evening air i chanced a look at him standing close beside me but apparently not daring to touch me as other couples stood draped all over one another we were a bit removed from the main group but still close enough to hear people talking his hands were in his pockets once more and he looked like a boy who would enjoy this type of thing we had sat together watching the firework show on new year eve i remembered but not want to let on nonchalant and mature but i wanted to see him without any inhibitions he had been so reserved lately and i hadntexpected for it to get worse once we got together i was gazing at the colours and patterns in his glasses and then i realized i was staring at my own reflection he had met my eyes and i felt my cheeks burn and i turned away as he spoke quietly almost drowned out by the gasps and cracks jenn had her baby it a girl it took a moment for me to think just who jenn was but then christmas with his family came flooding back to me and a grin spread over my face did she that brilliant what did they call her i asked with far more enthusiasm than he was speaking with they called her grace and another firework blast into the sky this time a big heart and then a cupid shooting his arrow they were thematic i realized still grinning a bit kissing had started among the people and i always felt uneasy when exposed to public displays of affection i looked to james again thinking we might share a bit of a chuckle but he just looked so damned exasperated with the whole thing and then he sighed if you didntwant to come here i said loudly and coldly with my nose stuck out a bit you shouldn t ve invited me if you had some crackpot idea that watching some bloody fireworks might make up for the way you ve been behaving i paused glaring at him i became very aware of how angry i was it felt good it felt nice some sort of release that he had refused to give me in any other way in talking to me or being with me or anything the only thing i could resolve to was being angry i was quite impatient with being quiet about it all because i felt guilty it wasntgetting me anywhere obviously then you were a bit wrong werentyou i dontcare if we ve only been together a short while you could ve been considerate enough to say happy valentine day i wasntsure he could hear me over all of the eruptions but i was almost yelling as it was it stupid and overdone but god james you dontput much effort into making a girl feel wanted he grabbed my elbow hard and pulled me to the side even further from the cluster of our peers his adam apple was bobbing and his eyes were alight and he looked as angry as i felt i ve been trying to be understanding and keep my mouth shut and try to get over get over what did sirius tell you that he knows about the two of us i interjected loudly trying to wrench my arm from his grasp but he just squeezed it harder pulling me closer to him and leaning down so our faces were level it has nothing to do with you telling sirius he was bound to hear it i dontcare no remus told me something and i realized lily that i couldnttrust you with anything i canttrust you with my friends and most certainly not my feelings for you my anger subsided quickly though more in a boiling over way than a soothed one red hot shame poured over me and i knew the moment he said remus name what he had found out why he didntthink he could trust me i felt like crying i was breathing fast and it wasntlike earlier when he had kissed the breath out of me i was shocked and perhaps panicking but mostly mortified it wasntfair it wasntright for him to throw that at me now when he had plently of time earlier when he could ve quietly discussed it with me but not when we were meant to be enjoying ourselves oh no i moaned and put my gloved hands to my face burying it away in them and trying to catch my breath in and out deeply now in and out and then he yanked my hands away and he was blazing he was furious and hurt but so was i we werenteven speaking you just up and decided to act as if i didntexist for three weeks and what would you have had me done go on acting fine with everything when you lied to me and you donttell me anything james you act like i donteven deserve to be with you as if i ve not earned the right and it not i was quivering and my breaths were coming shaky and i didntknow what to do i didntexpect you to go jump into bed with my best mate he told me and he let go of me and my voice croaked with tears when i spoke again james please i didntshag sirius we were just we were just comfort and fooling around it was stupid but so were you remus had no right telling you i hate him so badly it was between sirius and myself the calm came as quickly as the anger had and he told me again that he just could not trust me i held his wrist and pulled him close and stared into his eyes and i didntthink it would be like this the first time i didntthink i would want him this badly i didntthink anybody could become so attached to another human being you told me that anything you and sirius had at christmas time you said it was over with the two of you were friends and the minute that we re not on good terms you go to him i dontknow lily i just honestly dontknow nothing about the night now was as lovely and cleansing as it had first been the fireworks were obnoxious and the air was so cold it hurt to breathe and it was even darker now the last firework rang out into the sky and then everything went black it was in the second there before anyone could grab their wands and before any lights illuminated in the castle that i turned away from him and walked back toward the school i heard my name on his lips once more as i made off and it was a bit pleading but i didntthink i could handle it i didntthink i could handle him breaking up with me in front of so many people i felt ill my stomach flopping around and my heart fluttering strangely and betrayed and wasnteven thinking about how he felt though i hoped more than i knew that it was as terrible as i felt oh my god i thought as i wiped at my eyes my heart might actually be breaking abc sleep by azure ray abc wow so it been a long long while and i apologize for that i think or hope that this chapter is worth it i hope it not too boring or anything i really think i needed the extra time though for myself and to write some other things i appreciate all of your reviews and i you re the best critics a girl could have it so good and inspiring to know people enjoy this and i always try to impress i worry constantly over what my readers might think and try desperately to keep a good standard i hope you enjoy it and lyrics as always are on my livejournal the end bit may seem a bit abrupt it was meant to go on longer but i just felt it was fitting to end there it gives me a place to start in the next chapter and though it seems maybe a bit sad a bit depressing maybe yeah they had a huge row and maybe they ll break up who knows but consider the chapter title everything not lost it a coldplay song that i didntfind a place for in this chapter i just feel like despite it all there should be an underlying hope to this chapter my summer has been quite long and dull but enjoyable nonetheless i hope the rest of you are having good summer and that you re breaks dontend too too soon i looking forward to hearing from you kaitlyn p s if you re having trouble recalling what it is that remus told james you can take a look back at chapter 21 lost found the whole lily sirius thing takes place in that chapter chapter 26 the hardest part abc trouble sleeping by the perishers abc this seems awfully end of the world lily said a disgruntled remus lupin as i pulled him away from the kitchens and the girl with coppery coloured hair who was a year younger than us and whose blue eyes were rimmed with kohl are you seeing her i asked as he wrenched his sleeve from my grip and i stepped back against the cold stone walls of the dungeony corridor because she looks a bit like a tart oh yeah absolutely he nodded tossing his sandy hair from his eyes and staring at me with a furrowed brow she is a tart of course i not seeing her but a bloke doesntreally want to be alone on valentine and i didntquite fancy watching the fireworks with peter all romantic like and holding hands or something you could understand that yeah the pause that followed seemed to be one filled with deep curiosity on his behalf and regret on my own for deciding to come find him and speak with him moments earlier i had hated him so badly and blamed this all on him and now i couldnteven think of what to say and i realized i didnthate him quite as much as i once would have wait on it a minute i suppose we come to why are you alone on valentine s is that what so end of the world i buried my face away in my hands as the girl appeared in the portrait hole leading to the kitchens and she threw remus an incredibly toothy smile as she made her way up the corridor and then the stairs at the end of it we were left alone once again and i decided the hundred or so house elves in the kitchen would make for far better company than this boy my being alone right now that what i here to talk about i told him and he tilted his head to the side looking entertained and pleasantly so as the line between his brows eased slightly and his features lightened his mind seemed to be working furiously to keep ahead of me and he was thinking thinking trying to figure out what my being alone could possibly have to do with him and why it was so important to interrupt his date type thing with the coppery tart girl you told james it never struck him until the first couple of words left my mouth and then comprehension dawned in an extremely obvious way told by his suddenly slack jaw and the unnamable something that presented itself in his eyes i wondered if it was the closest thing to guilt that had ever prodded this boy brain oh oh that what this is then it all sort of coming out or something how incredibly dramatic of him to blast it open on what meant to be a nice evening for the two of you i held my breath and when i released it my hands shook and i cared so terribly much that i couldnteven bring myself to say that i did to say that i cared i couldntlook at remus and say that yes it was all sort of coming out and yes it was dramatic of him to bring it up in the middle of some preposterous firework show but i cared so much that i couldnteven let it finish i couldntstand still with him and hear it out hear him out or even hear myself out essentially i ran and by running i had left it hanging miserably in the cold colourful february air you werentbeing vindictive were you i mean i came here with every intention of being accusatory and pointing a finger but now i just sighing he understood what i just and he stepped closer to me staring me square in the eye i wouldntdo that lily he said and his voice was soft and quiet and close and i actually believed him i actually believed it could be some accident some fatal slip up of timing and precision and trust i wouldn t ve told him if he hadntasked asked did he the weariness in my voice was shameful and i was too young to be such an absolute waste i thought just then just looked at you and asked if you d heard any good stories about his best mate making out with his girlfriend might as well have we were sitting beside sirius bed in the hospital wing he was all cut up and bruised just after reg had finished with him y see and pete had just left so james got all distant and what not and as a loyal mate i had to ask him if he was alright standard answer to that question would be yeah thanks but instead he made a big fuss over replying sighed about it and then he asked if i thought whatever the two of you had you and sirius was really done with if it had really finished at christmastime i had to tell him lily he finished matter of factly i asked him to tell me exactly what he had told james and he did so very carefully and accurately it was the truth what he had told him james and i hadntbeen speaking properly since he came back from jocelyn funeral and it had been a long three weeks for everybody he spouted off sirius seemed to be at odds with him as well or just at odds with everything and it just sort of happened nothing terribly life altering but a few good make out sessions from time to time i doubted it would have mattered whether it had been a few good make out sessions or just two friends sharing the weight on their shoulders james still would have regarded it as betrayal on some account sighing i shook my head and it really wasntanybody fault but my own was it remus hadntbeen vindictive over it and he hadntembellished on it james just asked and remus just told and if the two of us had just broke up if we were just going to break up over it well there were only two people to blame abc remus walked with me back to gryffindor tower with an arm thrown casually around my shoulders weighing heavily across them and his wand held in the other hand lighting our way speaking of being vindictive he began as if it hadntbeen twenty minutes since our conversation had first started and ended as if we were still standing down there with a portrait of a bowl of fruit and the memory of brother fighting i knew i was smiling when he said her pretty name simply and with some air with something in his voice that wasntthere when he spoke of the coppery haired tart girl whose name i later asked and found was delilah but i thought would be something like trixie or bambi melly was the name that presently fell from his dry pink lips i always admired some flaw on a person that showed they spent a lot of time outdoors brown freckles across a nose chapped lips from the cold or tan lines around a wrist from a watch and i repeated her name it sounded strange and foreign that night after so long of forgetting december and everything that had come with it as i looked at him and waited for something more some voiced question rather than just the one that lay over his face you could tell them you know speaking of being vindictive you could tell them even us out get us playing on fair grounds again i think i d understand bless him i thought because he really was trying he really thought that by suggesting i expose him and melly less than healthy relationship it would somehow make things better i supposed it was his way of expressing guilt and i appreciated the effort i really did and the whole notion of being vindictive the whole notion of getting him back and slicing open a new wound for us all to gape at in order to forget about my own festering mess it might have sounded appealing if it was any other time if remus lupin had told me to play the melly card for any reason a few weeks ago i was sure i would have there was a change in my perspective though sometime between my three week long row with james and becoming his girlfriend something had changed and shifted and i was better perhaps a bit better and a bit smarter and i had a recurring thought remus really wasntthe worst person in the world hurting him didntsound quite as enjoyable as it once would have and when i stopped walking and hadntreplied he seemed to realize it too i think i ve gone a bit soft honestly it not my business you and melly it not james or sirius or peter business either dontworry about it okay i ll leave it alone it just seems so far away now or something not so much insignificant the two of you no just that i understand it better i walked ahead of him and he stayed standing there for a few moments until i entered the portrait hole and he clambered in a couple of seconds after remus cheeks were the slightest shade of pink as he made his way to the boy dormitory and i felt a little like bursting abc bridget reckoned we should talk about it me and james and she was a clever girl quite good at the whole boy thing so i thought about it for awhile and maybe talking wouldntbe so terrible after all i didnteven know if we had broken up or had a fight or what it was so i reckoned we should talk as well but i figured in order for the whole talking thing to work i would need to find him i would need to find him and sit him down and it would have to be quiet and maybe dark so i couldntsee him or his eyes those hazel hazel eyes yes it would definitely have to be dark i told bridget about the entire thing after remus and i had separated in the corridor and i found her almost immediately in the crowded common room she listened intently and chewed her lip and suddenly she wasntas brash as terribly unfeeling as she had been over the last few weeks the night was some breath of fresh air and it was funny that in order to grow even the tiniest bit closer to two people i had to completely set off another midnight was approaching and there were still classes the next morning offering me an excuse to give up my search for james earlier than an eager concerned girlfriend should have in truth i was dreading it and things were suddenly a bit less dramatic than i had made them out to be the world wasntabout to stop for the two of us and classes and head girl duties proved more pressing than some drawn out spat with james did so i did my best to forget of it until dinnertime the next day abc james arrived in the great hall in a sort of blaze his strides were long and quick and he observed his surroundings with a gaze that was confident and unconcerned and it sent something shooting through me to see him like that i didntreally expect him to be a mess to be falling apart i figured if i wasnta mess or falling apart than he wouldntbe so it wasntas if i expected him to come moping into the great hall for dinner and maybe look a bit tired and worn out it just seemed wrong though the look in his eyes and the smile at the corners of his mouth lily his voice held a quiet warning and it pulled my gaze away from james and across the table to where he sat the other two marauders were in deep conversation about what was different with the potatoes at this meal and there he sat sirius his goblet in his hand raised to his mouth and his eyes averted from me the clatter and clamour of dinner threw me off for a moment or two and i lost my train of thought forgot that i had been eyeing james and instead frowned at sirius trying to decipher just what he was trying to tell me by raising his eyebrows slightly and not looking at me then i saw sirius eyes following something james departing from the hall with a load of sandwiches and sweets and remembered that i had wanted to find him wanted to make things right with him the second i had seen that strange smile on his face i pushed myself away from the table and rushed to the entrance hall though james had already disappeared you think it a good idea to go dashing after him all damsel in distress after what happened last evening he still a bit pissed lily i spun around my hair flying into my face and my arms flailing wildly as i tried to tame it my heart was thumping rapidly and i felt an instantaneous anger toward him just seeing him looking handsome and disheveled in his uniform after the day classes and so involved so concerned with the situation made me hate that it had been him i had kissed and it had been him that i fell for first it shouldn t ve been for kissing sirius was the reason that james hadntan ounce of trust in me and i was so over this boy this game oh who do you think you are i said exasperated you think it a good idea to even be seen speaking to me after the overreaction he gone and had how that fair he as good as dumped me over it but you two are still chummy i knew if they were on good terms again if they were speaking and if the four of them had returned to their previously untouchable state well it had taken awhile for it to get back there and i should really be glad if they were speaking once more it took a load of guilt off me and i could quit feeling so destructive the only reason we re alright is because of what happened with reg and because when he looked me in the face and asked if i had been fooling around with you a couple of weeks ago i didntrun off all in a fuss because i was missing the firework show i shook my head and looked to my feet straightening my sweater and the pleats in my skirt i couldntexplain it but my cheeks were on fire and my body was shaking a bit and i think it was relief what i was feeling relief for having someone to shout at and relief for having someone besides myself to blame for the potential loss of james it wasntlike that at all i tried to tell him and explain it but how do you explain something like that he not going to understand or i suppose he could but he just not going to want to hear it from me i left because i didntreally fancy the idea of him breaking it off in front of so many people the longer he went without speaking the longer he stood there with his hands clasped all gentlemanly behind his back and with his head bowed in some sign of respect or apology the more i wanted to pull my wand out and hex him why it me you re angry with i wasntthe one who told him lily it was remus and i just bothering with you now because i felt bad i suppose maybe if you just leave him be he wontbreak it off just never mind it and he ll come around is all i want you to know nodding i said alright i d leave it alone for a day or two and i told him i was angry with him because it was as much of his fault as it was mine own and i just felt forced to resent it and i was angry at the entire thing not just him he walked away after bidding me good day and i felt a semblance of what james must ve the night before exposed and unfulfilled just unheard yes leaving it be for a day or two maybe it would do us both some good abc that saturday gryffindor had a quidditch match against hufflepuff the sky was clear and impossibly blue and the sun shone down upon the grounds patches of brown dead grass were visible through the melting snow and there was a faint distinct taste of spring in the air though it was still only february and the air was still cold enough to bring colour to your cheeks you could feel it it was imminent perhaps it was that the looming spring taunting and appealing which prompted me to go outside after the match was over and perhaps it was that the feeble strength of the sun rays that made me stop in my tracks when i saw him approaching the breeze that swept over me as i stood with my arms folded and my hair blowing was a pleasant refreshing one like the days that had passed without him pleasant and refreshing and liberating i hadntrealized how restricted how awkward i felt around him until i spent those couple of days with nobody but bridget and the occasional remus usually i frowned a lot too much and usually by the end of the day my head throbbed and ached and i was so temperamental but when i didnthave to worry about him when i chose not to worry about him i felt somehow lighter i wished james could see me that way because i knew he d like me better he d want me around more did you win captain i said with a grin as he neared me his broomstick thrown over his shoulder and his hair a wind swept mess of course he replied setting his broom on the ground beside where we stood and turning to look back at the pitch james was very proud he always was after a good game it would have been nice if there was a game every week to keep him in such uplifted spirits because he would crash just a couple of days later you not watch it he asked looking at me once more his scarlet robes fluttering around him sorry no i wanted to finish my homework up today and well i thought it was colder out than it actually is james nodded and when i met his eyes he quickly looked to his hands and adjusted the leather gloves he wore he appeared to tower over me just then and it was funny to have him appear so dominating when his head was lowered and his eyes were flitting around did you mean it when you said you couldnttrust me with anything i asked in a low tone after a minute or two of just standing with my hands clasped in front of me and of him kicking at the snow certainly i did and can you blame me everything so tangled and i didntrealize it and it was just really odd to hear about the two of you i was extremely oblivious to the entire thing and lily i looked up from watching my hands twist and turn when he said my name to find him looking at me this was it i thought it didntfeel quite as apocalyptic as i thought it would i think when i asked you to when i decided i wanted you to be my girlfriend i think it was just a way to keep you around to not lose touch with you i donteven know if i really wanted it i think the whole idea of being only friends was kind of foreign to me and i never really took the time to figure out how it was i felt about you i held my breath for a moment and let it back out and felt the blood rush and i didntlike when my hands trembled james if you want to break it off if this is you breaking up with me then just do it and dontstand here and say it because you never really cared about me or you couldntquite grasp the concept of just being friends dontsay that because i dontbelieve it you know exactly how you felt about me and i am sorry about sirius his hazel eyes danced in the sunlight and the sparkling snow and he was smiling at me abc the scientist by coldplay abc it good to hear you talk like that lily like you know what you re saying and mean it he brought my body close to his and held me there longer than i thought was typical for a breakup and his cheek pressed against mine and he chuckled warmly in my ear tickling it and he told me he was so fond of me and he was sorry too it wasntuntil later that night after the party in the gryffindor common room had ended and after the butterbeer had been drank up and the fire had died and i was laying in my bed with my eyes wide wide open that i realized that had really been it he was even noble when he was breaking a girl heart and it would be two long months before i bothered thinking about or talking to him again abc okay so just over two months since i last updated i do apologize for my being soso slow but i can say that i worked steadily on this chapter and that i reallyreally like it i think it far happier than we re used to for all that matters while being a tad melancholy i think i pleased with how it turned out and i hope you all are as well i cantmake any promises about the next chapter and just enjoy this one okay lyrics are on my livejournal which can be found in my profile and feedback is always appreciated kaitlyn chapter 27 april showers abc oleander by sarah harmer abc march came and went lethargically bringing with it bare grey skies and the sun lacklustre attempt to bring warmth and life back into the world there was no in like a lamb out like a lion or vice versa there was just day after day of entering the great hall and gazing up at the ceiling appearing as the sky and seeing nothing out of the ordinary just another bland day there were no remarkable snow storms and nothing exciting to bring everyone out of their slump perhaps it was being so far into the term but still so far away from june perhaps it was the never ending winter and spending our evenings contemplating what magic can do for the weather rather than studying whatever it was it was widespread and exhausting an echoing sort of quiet in every corridor of the castle during march there was bridget there was bridget and remus and some other girls from our year who really werentthat bad march brought boring weather a load of work and friends the apparent war that was waging through the winter seemed to suddenly stop the daily prophet told of no mysterious deaths no serpents in the sky and nothing about pureblood and their plans to rid the magical world of all of the impurities that muggles bestowed upon it this was what they called suspicious ministry of magic so went a conversation had one morning at breakfast they re doing a better job covering this whole thing up than they could have done preventing it the seventh year boys in gryffindor often sparked great debates about the whole thing and it was thrilling to sit in on one conspiracies and murder and some clan of dark magic followers there was maturation about us the graduating class through the months that made me begin to wonder if we really were going to be all right i grew no closer in the month that passed since james and my demise to figuring out just what it was i planned to do with my life i took my classes and i sat my tests and i received my grades but nothing was set in my mind nothing was on fire and nothing was passionate i felt like march had felt boring and incomplete and uninteresting it wasntquite as depressing as one might think it would have been though i hadntfelt so absolutely carefree in my life although i could have been mistaking carefree with purposeless remus felt sorry i knew he did he felt sorry and he looked sorry and i thought he was spending time with me to make up for it to somehow make me forget of james and to help usher me along but after a couple of weeks when he was still there in the common room at night talking to bridget and me about things i hadntan idea interested him i realized this might very well be a friendship with remus lupin the marauders were some reunited front and it was sometimes sickening how strong their bond was how they could be around one another so often sirius didnttake the time to speak to me very often only in passing and james and i would greet one another when head duties made it impossible not to otherwise there was nothing there was a gaping void where they once were and bridget was often very careful not to mention it but i didntreally miss them all that much yes most of the time i spoke to peter pettigrew more than i did either of them and he was quite the twitchy boy but entertaining at times abc april brought relief in the form of rain in the form of rain and sunshine and sometimes both sometimes there were both and sometimes there were rainbows and it was spring when the grass turned green and the sun shone strong and my freckles reappeared along with relief there was easter to look forward to in april a long glorious week of easter holidays and just the anticipation of such a thing felt nice each day we ticked off how much time was left until the weekend that the holidays began on we had decided to boycott work and just eat and sleep and breathe not many seventh years would be going home for the holidays just those whose parents still valued their presence but the need and appeal of running home during every break had long since worn off and we were just looking forward to enjoying the weather and the castle and good company the students who would be going home left on monday after the weekend i woke the morning that marked the beginning of break a saturday to a pale yellow sky lit by a lazy sun and clouded by some lingering fog the dormitory was empty and i hummed quietly as i searched for clothes to put on it was sometime near 11 o clock and i pushed open the window a bit as i tossed my shirt off breathing deeply standing in my black bra and pajama pants a navy t shirt in my hand i looked down over the greening grounds the trees were budding and flecks of colour dotted the lawns flowers blooming everything glistened with water droplets and it had been raining so often lately april showers you know people would repeat that it was nice to have the sun shining albeit weakly the air smelled sweet and warm the way it does after a downpour and there was something rich and earthy about it too i tied my hair back into a ponytail and it was uplifting and relieving to feel this content and peaceful my skin was as fair as ever washed in the golden light from the hazy sun and goose bumps raised along my arms and shoulders as a shiver wracked through me the feeling came and went quickly but it was there long enough to prompt a frown from me some sudden melancholy something quite sad and strange the door opened to the dorm and i tugged my shirt on turning around to greet bridget and closing the window as i did so i began suggesting we spend the day outside on the grounds lounging and oh iced tea or pumpkin juice would be splendid if it gets warm enough but she didntsay anything just stood there looking odd and her cheeks were pink wind kissed and her normally sleek hair was a mess yeah it is nice out a bit of a breeze is all i was just down with she trailed off hopelessly and i frowned at her now lily listen i dontknow who would well i guess i should tell you because everyone else has gone and the only reason i know otherwise i wouldn t i swear you d be the one telling me is because i have such a thing for sirius black and i not sure where it came from but that not at all what i have to tell you it just lily mister potter he he died slack jawed and narrow eyed i ungracefully choked out wha and wasntsure what i was questioning whether it be her new thing for sirius black or a potter dying a potter dying my mind screamed and it was blazing and painful and i blinked heavily shaking my head and stared at bridget who died she told me again and said she had been spending time with sirius lately so when the news came they were in the common room together and all of the boys left immediately she had accompanied them outside and oh my gosh james i muttered a hand to my mouth sinking down onto the bed and it felt like those two months without him hadnthappened melancholy was quite fitting i realized for the sunny foggy spring morning abc the commander thinks aloud by the long winters abc there were a few minutes four or five in which i floundered about trying to think clearly and ask bridget just what had happened when she said she didntknow when she said all she knew was that jude had died and that the boys were leaving i decided to be angry with her who did she think she was after all to march into the dormitory and just stand there and let me ramble on about the weather and then tell me mr potter had died in between confessing her newfound thing for sirius black and why hadntshe been decent enough to find out what had happened just how one went about dying before declaring it to me i felt ill and my face was hot my heart beating painfully and i couldnthelp but think that ray her ray had just died in january and here she was all caught up in sirius and how was it he did that made a girl forget about anything else and oh it was those eyes those fathomless grey eyes and i felt like i should warn bridget of something but i couldntthink of a foul word to say about him despite wishing i could i wasntjealous i was overwhelmed sirius wasntthe type of boy that causes jealousy because there a widespread fact that there is enough of him for everyone and he was not someone i had even wanted to be around for months so what you ve been running around with sirius behind my back and thought now was an appropriate time to throw it out there i snapped looking at her from where i sat and not feeling the slightest remorse as a startled expression passed her features lily honestly there been no running around he been lonely i think i just said i not sure where it came from it just did and we re mostly friends it just sometimes i think i d like to kiss him you would i thought it lovely but i not at all encouraging a relationship or anything i ve just been giving him company oh lily james dad died please think of that and not some suppressed feelings for sirius i stood up chewing my lip and glowering at her it wasnther fault at all that he had died but it seemed fair then at least to take it out on her you re a bit useless stood here going on about sirius but you donteven know how jude died i suppose i ve got to sit around for a week before i find out what happened she exhaled loudly and looked as if she regretted stepping foot in the dorm and as i made to leave she called out it not my fault you went and lost james otherwise you d have known abc easter sunday came with even tempered weather and skies so clear and i found myself very much alone a sleepy dusk was falling all around taking the sunlit common room and bathing it in a romantic glow and sigh what a day to be all alone waiting on a not so reliable boy about a man death i was curled up in an armchair and you could hear people down on the grounds laughing as the day faded and i felt like fading too just sitting there staring at the open windows in the room it was kind of difficult to think of james and of his father to realize that he had died maybe because i had been without james for so long and maybe because i did not know mr potter that well it didntseem possible to me sure they talked about deaths there at hogwarts and all of the attacks and drama and yes it was terrible but i didnt know those people i had never seen them or known them well enough to really feel the loss i wondered when all of this tragedy would start occurring to me i figured when it happened i d be worse for the wear and there was something about young people teenagers that make them believe they re immortal and even when other young people are dying we dontbelieve it can happen to us to ourselves it was a scary way to live as if you have no boundaries like you re some untouchable presence i felt careless and foolish but i really preferred it that way when i drew myself from my thoughts looking over to the window again i saw the owl perched on the ledge staring at me with its large eyes nearly tripping over myself to get to it i took the scroll from it and it flew away at once i glanced at it quickly noting the signature at the bottom as remus and then i started again lily i hope this finds you in better spirits than those we re in right now as i asked bridget to tell you jude has died i cantsay much here just that it was unexpected and untimely and typical death like things well the wake is monday afternoon around 3 o clock and i know the hogwarts express is leaving earlier in the morning monday likely 7 or 8 it would be good of you to come lily i think james would appreciate it he inconsolable as you can imagine even if you dontmake it for the funeral just showing up would be incredibly unselfish of you take care remus and the potter address followed his sign off abc i wasntsatisfied with the letter i was so tired of not knowing and even slightly disappointed it hadntbeen james writing to me but then again who did i think i was he was vulnerable and at a place in his life you never want to find yourself in how could i expect him to think of writing to me nevertheless i packed a bag sunday evening and woke early monday morning and got on the hogwarts express in hogsmeade like any other student as if i were looking forward to a nice holiday i apologized to bridget and still felt unreasonably cold towards her and told her i was leaving and she was not going home over the break and the feeling of lonely was gripping me like never before not because i had been lonely but it was hard to imagine what those months would have been like without her the weather was stubbornly persistent in being fair and pleasant and i wished it was pelting down rain from dark grey clouds and storming and rumbling because this wasntthe type of day you associate with a funeral a man death april showers would be more like it it was a long train ride with a couple of 6th year girls and a 7th year boy all from ravenclaw house so i didntreally know them i spoke sparingly and stared out the window most of the time because what i was doing where i was going just became apparent to me and i could not think of james and how he was doing because i was just so bad at these types of things these thinking and relating and consoling things i did not know how he would be and i didntknow what i would say to him there was one black dress that i owned and i thought my chest looked too good in it and my waist too narrow and since when did girls criticize themselves if they looked nice in a dress i just felt guilty and strange and needed something other than him to think about i changed into the dress on the train it was a shirt dress collared with buttons from the top to the bottom the sleeves stopped at my elbows cuffed and the waist was belted the hem of it just hitting my knees i wore a pair of flat black sandals and no tights as i thought of a way to cover my legs pale but long i realized i was also terrified to see mrs potter again who would likely think no tights equaled no class or something i felt like i had no place going there but such a place too i hadntbeen so torn before in my life when the ride was over i felt my nerves catch up with me and my hands shook as i used a payphone to call a cab and hesitantly handed over the potter address abc the driver commented as we pulled up to the house that there must be something going on and i just smiled and said yes there was because the street was lined with cars and i never thought the wake would be held here i walked slowly carrying my luggage awkwardly and wishing that i had taken my sunglasses off before i knocked on the door there wasntany noise inside movement anything i had expected a great deal given the number of cars parked and not to mention all of the witches and wizards who would have apparated and used floo powder as i raised my fist to knock again observing the front yard which was luscious looking already with its green green grass the door opened and oh of course it was james he still towered over me when i expected him to be hunched and small i could see the muscle in his set jaw and his flaring nostrils was the only sign he gave of surprise adjusting his glasses a hand back through his hair he told me that everyone was in the back yard that where uh you know it ll be and i dropped my bag and took my sunglasses off as i flung my arms around him tip toed and pathetic you re shameless i thought and the only thing that was really familiar about him was his smell not his quiet voice his white skin or his expressionless face no just his warm neck and how he was everything that was good composure and self respect seemed to be something we both lacked for he was clutching onto me so tightly i could barely breathe let alone speak and it felt so nice his fingers splayed about my waist over my ribs and i heard him tell me that he had forgotten how tiny i was and really i wasn t nearly 130 pounds was healthy but it was so wonderful that he was speaking and he was not crying or stumbling just talking hoarsely to me thankful i d been too tired to wear makeup i pulled back from him wiping my eyes with the hand i held my sunglasses in the other one tugging on my ponytail really what was the matter with me it was his father who had just died i didntwant to be the first to mention it james picked my bag up from the stoop and i stepped inside the house which hadntseemed this inviting when it was christmastime it was warm and cinnamon bread and flower aromas wafted through the air and there was a look of disarray to the rooms i still hadntsaid a single word to him as we moved into the living room and i could just almost hear voices drifting in from outside james was standing in the doorway of the room and i turned around to look at him standing close and opening my mouth to say something insightful and consoling i really sorry james his hazel eyes were roaming and burning and when i said his name they stopped on me i choked on anything else i might ve said as with hands on my lower back he turned me and leaned me gently against the wall and it was some sort of slow motion thing when he kissed me it was with slight stubble on his face and an eager mouth and this isntwhat i here for i thought he never moved his hands from my back keeping a grip on me and i brought a hand up to his face resting it there as he kissed and kissed me like he hadntdone for ages it was a few minutes before he pulled back and i looked up at him slightly dazed with flushed cheeks and fuller lips oh god this is a funeral i mumbled to myself looking down as he buried his face against my neck and sighed my name and thunder clapped rain fell and the funeral was delayed for a half hour until the rain stopped coming down james asked me if i thought it ever really would stop coming down and he was sad i decided as guests made their ways back into the house without a man i felt something for him that day that i never had before abc into dust by ashtar command or mazzy star abc okay you re going to have to forgive me for this when was the last time i updated november just a couple of days off my 2nd anniversary very hard to think i ve been writing this for over two years that such a long time i would ve been so young as i was saying you must forgive me for the 3 month delay i dontknow what i was doing to sum up these last three months christmas came and went and it was great and busy as usual school has been crazy but second term has started now and exams are done so it getting better university applications and all of that junk is pressing but oh well my grandmother died and the winter is cold and this took me so long to write i had been doing well with it it was getting long but then a week ago i erased almost everything i had written since november and i rewrote it all so this is very fresh very new very how i am feeling it kind of quick and written differently i think but it meant to be a buildup to the next chapter it doesntseem all that sad and there not much dwelling on james yet but there will be if i had focused on all of that in this chapter it would ve been soooo huge i ve written exams i honouring with distinction i ve figured out where i want to go next year but nothing brings the sense of accomplishment that finally finishing this chapter does i hope you like it and i know there so much lily in this that it almost irritating but i think it s interesting to focus on her for such a long time and please dontcriticize the two of them kissing again after two months of not it sort of just happened as i was writing it and it how i imagine james would be affectionate desperate yes so the lyrics to the songs are on my livejournal as always and i really recommend all of these songs love kaitlyn chapter 28 futures abc half acre by hem abc james had the earnest slightly awkward look to him of a boy who had just gotten a haircut that hadnthad the chance to grow out his nose seemed longer his forehead broader his eyes wider and he looked so young he kept dragging his hand back through it ruffling it and hoping that each time he did so it would draw attention away from his jagged fringe he stood in the misty rain wearing a long big buttoned wool coat and he looked very pale in the grey afternoon there was a frown on his face as he laid a hand on his father urn jude had been cremated and it made the entire thing seem less official but it was also easier to deal with the service had ended just as the sky clouded over again and there wasntany lightening to accompany the thunder or the showers just a couple of claps and it had ended the entire day felt backwards and mixed up and there were no sad hymns or long eulogies just a reverend standing with a bible in his hands and james mum sat up front with a very set expression on her face i did not take her as one to cry and she didn t just held her daughter hand it was completely inappropriate of me to be standing there and watching him as he grieved and i was remembering things the reverend had said redemption and salvation and eternal happiness and i could not connect those words with anything else but they were words of comfort and something about a better place i blinked and looked at james again gripping the sliding patio door tempted to join him in his misery which loved company with that thought i pulled the door open and crossed the lawn to where he was the urn was on a stand surrounded by bright flowers and water spotted photographs of the happy smiling man it was eerie to watch him moving around and waving from the photos when he was deceased i shook my head and shivered as the rain sprinkled lightly onto my bare forearms and neck goose bumps rising along my skin he turned to look at me and i didntfeel quite so bad for imposing when he tugged his lips into a painful smile he wore a pair of grey slacks and a white buttoned up shirt with a tie and he was worn but good i had only spoke to him once since my arrival to tell him i was sorry and it was unbecoming of me to have had made out with him without saying anything substantial to console him it cleared out a bit in there not as crowded i told him and he nodded once looking down at the sodden grass and then up at the sky he sighed and it was deep and i could sort of feel the ache in my own chest you should come in so you dontcatch a cold or something he quirked an eyebrow at me and i shrugged telling him i wasntsure it was accurate that you could catch a cold from damp or chilly weather but i always heard mum saying it and he let out a strange choked laugh and you lily evans are not a mum so please dontstand here and talk like you wouldntnormally talk you know just say whatever it is you feel like saying and dontact like you re worried about me catching a cold my heart leapt into my throat when he smiled at me and it reached his eyes crinkling them slightly and i swallowed a few times before taking a shaky breath i feel and i think i think the boys feel too completely responsible in making sure that you re okay and i know you re not okay and maybe you will never be i dontknow but i will say anything i need to say to help get you there i canteven imagine how you re feeling though fit to burst he interrupted with a reassuring squeeze to my arm there was a needy declaration lingering on my tongue i need you to be okay and i bit my lip unsure of whether to say it unsure of whether it would be selfish or sweet of me i shivered again wringing my hands and he opened his coat damp as it was allowing me to slide my arms around his waist and rest my head against his shoulder he was terribly warm his skin slick with the persistent mist of a rain and he felt very stable for a boy whose entire world had just endured quite the pummel abc rain city by turin brakes abc evening came the sun sank the sky glowed through the grey and the mist and everyone was keeping it together i had taken a shower after fetching james and returned downstairs to calm and quiet treading softly i peered into the living room where mrs potter sat with melly parents and her husband family his sister brother in law and niece mary mac and jenn all of whom i had met at christmas were pleasant and kind and this event did not seem to change that jenn had a baby in her arms and her husband by her side the four marauders were sitting around the kitchen table playing cards and drinking butterbeer and there was something inexplicable and languid in the air remus even seemed to be at ease for perched on his knee was melly the lovely neighbour girl she shuffled the cards as the boys drank and decided which game to play next and none of them seemed to pay the slightest mind to the situation something he had worried would be a big deal fooling around with melly suddenly was not and it so is funny how something like death can do that put things into perspective james looked up as i came into the kitchen and his eyes crinkled as he grinned you didnthave to put that back on he said simply referring to the dress i still wore while everyone else had changed into lounge clothes i never thought i muttered sweeping my damp hair up into a ponytail as he drew a chair up to the table for me their game commenced and i sat beside him wordlessly observing and i knew them not to be carefree but just so comfortable that they could deal with it like this they could forget the awkward apologies and condolences and find solace in one another company and when you thought of it when you thought of four boys who were this close you appreciated it and praised it but also grew curious of it i wondered what it was what event or what year or what it was that had bonded them in such a way sitting around with james family extended and otherwise i began to think of my own family and of a letter i had received from my sister sometime at the end of january or first of february she had told me the house had sold and it was not something i found significant anymore not something that bothered me like it had a couple of months previous the longer the card game pressed on however and the longer i thought about that letter and what else it had contained the guiltier i grew she had told me the house had been sold and she told me that mum was doing fine and dad was as well and she had begrudgingly i thought invited me to her wedding she was marrying a man named vernon and i remembered meeting him one summer i had gone home when she was still a teenager despite resenting her i found it admirable she could marry someone she had been seeing for so long she could stay with someone for such a time commitment i supposed i had thought about going i had seriously seen myself going and congratulating her and being the sister i should have always been supportive and kind and caring for i was older now and capable of making amends with her she was embarrassed of me and my lifestyle and was so different from when we were little girls but she was my blood and i was going to her wedding the wedding had been last week the week before the easter holidays began on a saturday afternoon i despite my good intentions had not gone i did not go and sit and smile and tell her how beautiful she looked instead i stayed at school and i wondered if she noticed or cared and a week later the weather had been nice the day of her wedding i recalled and it was a good thing because she would have been one of those hellish brides if anything had gone wrong i was sitting in james potter kitchen because his father a man i barely knew had died and it was raining and pouring and oh the whole world was spinning are you okay he asked with a hand to my arm and my gazed rested on his hand before turning to meet his eyes i felt impossible and stupid when i looked at him and he was asking if i was okay it wasntany fair that i was so terrible at being supportive everything i thought to say to him everything i had decided to say while standing in the shower in the spare bedroom i had occupied at christmas it all seemed far too empty and i could not imagine what i would find comforting in a situation like this so i just chewed my lip and did not often look at him and there he was concerned for me absolutely i said my fingers atop his for a moment before he pulled back and sort of considered me giving a nod and continuing in his game before the card game ended i didnteven know what they were playing i had locked eyes with melly and i tried to smile or something but it ended up awkward and she looked at remus and then me and she was so pretty and so delicate and the strangest thought occurred to me about the two of them being in love i was aching for happiness in some form abc sometime after midnight when everybody who was leaving had left and everyone who was staying remained i found myself alone lying on the bed in the guest room i occupied i hadntspoken to anybody but james the entire day and it was beginning to get to me i felt really suffocated incomplete for some reason i wanted to talk to remus to thank him for writing to me i wanted to tell sirius i was sorry for jude was more of a father to him than his own there was some extreme out of place feeling pressing in on me and i had not even been aware of it i didntknow when my and james world had once again become separate james cousin jenn and her husband were staying the night for mrs potter and lexi were going to mac and mary s i imagined it would be difficult for her to stay in the big grand house without her husband remus and sirius stayed too though peter left to spend the remainder of the holidays with his mum and melly was still sitting with remus when i had gone to bed there was something hollow something missing the comfort of company did not seem to curb the cold the void in the potter house there were six of us there that night but i felt miles away from another human being sitting around in solitary is the last thing you need when your mind is turning rapidly and there is still tragedy in the air sitting up off the bed i went into the bathroom joined to the bedroom with the intentions of washing my face and finally changing into a pair of pajamas i turned the water on and let it run over the washcloth until it was steaming hot laying it on my face and breathing deeply i went back into the bedroom unhooking the belt of my dress and slipping the buttons from their holes looking for my bag that i had tossed into the room earlier with the dress on the floor at my feet and as i tugged on the sleeve of a pajama shirt from my bag i realized the door was shut firmly whereas i had left it slightly ajar there was no doubt in my mind of how it had closed but i still took my time turning around oh god i said startled though i was expecting to see him lying there on my his bed with his hands clasped over his stomach his response was a soft mutter that i couldntquite decipher but i stood where i was in a bra and half slip the pajama shirt hanging uselessly in front of me i watched him take a deep rather shaky breath his chest rising and falling slowly and approached him tossing the shirt on top of my dress and folding my arms how did he die i asked and it sounded vulgar and bold but curiosity had gotten the better of me and i for a moment didntcare if james was on the verge of some breakdown or if his mum was doing well or if his friends were fine i wanted to know how jude had died i wanted to know if it had been brutal and murderous and why nobody was talking about it i bit my lip and he frowned but barely faltered in answering me heart attack james said and i supposed i felt relieved felt slightly thankful that it wasntanything to do with the dark wizards or the waging war but then it struck me once again that a man had died and i was so morbid he slowly sat up and i felt a jolt in my stomach a quickening of my heart at the look on his face in his eyes for a boy who had been playing cards just a couple of hours ago who had been laughing and smiling and spending time with his friends he certainly looked angry but it wasntthe i want to scream and yell and maybe hit you or just punch something very hard kind of angry it was an incredibly lily you slag sexy looking angry my cheeks burned red and i remembered my bra tightening my arms and covering myself the best i could he was a boy after all and i wondered if he still liked me or maybe just wanted to kiss me and why he was looking like that with a wrinkle between his brows and a muscle ticking in his jaw he put one of his hands on my back on the spare bit of skin between my bra and slip and pulled me closer to where he sat minutes later i found myself and not very gracefully tousle headed and red lipped beneath him on the bed somehow between kissing him and touching his hair and his shoulders i found the time to wonder where the boundaries had gone when had it become appropriate acceptable for him to see me in my undergarments to kiss me like i meant something to him to say so little to me it did not seem quite right for the two of us to be holed up in this room secluding ourselves and falling back into some destructive habit it did not seem right that he was in the mood for kissing when his dad had died and i realized that i wasntat all sure how to deal with it the gravity of the situation the overall seriousness of it never seemed to penetrate me all i could think of was him and i hardly spared a thought or a word for sirius or remus or any other member of mr potter family there was something remarkably appealing about james before i could say anything to him he had rolled from atop me and instead lay beside me it all seemed to get a bit overwhelming for both of us for he had recoiled and was frowning up at the ceiling not offering me the girl he had just pinned to the bed and made out with so much as a glance james and i had meant to tell him before he could look at me or touch me that it was okay i wasntgoing anywhere and i could be here for him i could be supportive of him without having to be kissed my being around did not mean i expected anything from us anything in the form of a relationship or a reconciliation and i had been forming the words had been thinking them while meeting his hazel eyes but just as quickly as determinedly they had left i dontknow what to do he said to me his voice quiet and rough i think i need to be capable and strong but it just not working i ve got friends and a mum and a sister and they re all coping and there just devastation scrawled over everything but i seem to be the only one to see it i shook my head laying on my side and facing him a hand beneath my head and the other tracing up and down his bare arm no you re not everyone probably thinking the same thing there no rulebook that says how to handle stuff like this you re dad just died james he winced and shut his eyes you are allowed to be miserable minutes passed and nothing was said and the room was dark and stuffy and i had an urge i had the desire to be outside and liberated i wanted to be far away from this world this magic and this heartbreak i whispered his name my eyes shut and lashes brushing my cheeks three or four times before i began telling him about my sister i did not expect him to care i did not want him to care i just felt completely obligated to keep him either focused or distracted he made a soft sound when i had finished expressing my guilt and my uncertainty over my future over my life it occurred to me that this would be nice to have and when i wasntsure what this was i knew it was him he would be nice to have again you are going to be all right i think lily you re better than you think you are i smiled slightly and left my eyes closed legs tangled up with his bra strap falling down my shoulder and hand against his chest completely unable to feel any sort of heartbeat or warmth or something romantic like that but to have him close again was lovely and reassuring death was peculiar and unsettling and to dwell on it too long could do more damage than good i felt a bursting pulsing hope that night with him something that had love and spring and graduation all over it and the future rang through my head more than once and i wanted to tell him that we could have a future we were the future and there was the future to look forward to i figured he already knew though because had a boy whose father just died not been thinking about the future really how could you even go on living properly if you werentthinking about something optimistic the weeks months we had been apart had done him well and i would have slept with him that night if i had a bit less sense to me i would have fallen in love with him and slept with him and completely ignored the prospect of friendship if i was just the tiniest bit passionate though there are always futures abc to sheila by the smashing pumpkins abc hi there once again sorry for the delay hope things are well for everybody and this chapter wasntquite what i intended for it to be nothing terribly life altering or anything but i think it works okay for how mr potter death should be handled nothing over the top just you know lily james thank you for all of the wonderful reviews too chapter 29 sound of settling abc lack of colour by death cab for cutie abc i awoke the sort of abrupt coming to that you do not enjoy and sends your heart thumping madly in your chest at sometime after 4 o clock to a lighter bed and a draftier room james was there perched on the ledge of the open window in the bedroom hanging from his mouth was a cigar and he was quite terrible at it sort of sucking and blowing out and not really inhaling and i got the impression he had lost his sense of self the smell was putrid and the look on his face told he did not like it either to me it was all endearing i starving are you starving he asked suddenly not looking at me not acknowledging that i had just woke up and that it was gone 4 a m uh i had found the pajamas that i had been so determined to put on earlier folded at the foot of the bed right now maybe i dontknow did you put these here yeah he responded cigar stuck back in his mouth teeth clenching onto it as he held onto the ledge leaning out of the window a bit more i quickly changed into the pajamas and he was gentlemanly drastically different from a few hours previous and did not look my way until i had finished i felt dignified and was appreciative of him for it god no i honestly starving he snubbed the cigar out tossed it out the window and turned to me still propped up on the window ledge with a curious sort of frown on his face smoothing my hair i crawled to the other side of the bed and then sat up dangling my legs from the side and watching my feet swing back and forth the immediate response i thought of was to tell him that it was 4 o clock and that he looked really terrible all dark circles and pale skin he needed to sleep and smoking anything wasntgoing to help matters or change anything so he might as well not do it his voice was hoarse and his hair sticking up his eyes bleary and i was about to tell him we should just you know go back to sleep rest but it occurred to me that to disturb this to disturb him now when he seemed to be on some high when he seemed to be untouchable and perhaps in denial would be disastrous maybe there was some salvation in the dark the night for him and it was not my place to coax him back to reality it obviously was not where he wanted to be just then you know i like you in pajamas as much as that bra i wished he was okay as he let on with a wide smile it felt strange to be smiling so honestly and brightly at a time like this but i wondered what the restrictions were on a time like this how long was it meant to last i joined him at the window adjusting myself to sit on the large ledge too drawing one of my knees up to my chest and wrapping my arms around it you should know that it not going to be like this and it was nothing serious nothing heavy and the smile stayed on my face in my voice as i spoke it not going to be you kissing me and you seeing me in my under things and you waking me at 4 o clock because you re starving a ponderous sort of sigh left his mouth and his lips were upturned slightly i just dontthink it should be that easy all kisses and beds and neediness it ll change you ll get tired of it and i ll be alone again i ve missed you and my being here now is not some outlet for you i just want to be near you and in your life again i thinking we should start like that eyes sparkling and dazzling and hazel he nodded slowly and turned his gaze out over the street and the sky before muttering all right lily a heaviness was in my chest a constricting feeling it lifted and then my pulse was racing and i felt like i could breathe easy again maybe it was all right maybe we could be and the optimism the inexplicable good cheer that i felt that night never really left me after that there was something reassuring about him even when he was a starving smoking mess the sky was all navy moon stars and satellites and it was vast and forever and there was so much in forever to rely on something about the unknown that was as enticing as jude death was heartbreaking i could not quite understand this rebirth this liberation but i did figure it was what drew us in again james left the bedroom declaring his starvation once again and whether he did really go to eat i did not know for i remained and went back to sleep the smell of the cigar lingered in the room and on my pillow was the smell of his shampoo and it was funny how boys always smelled starkly different than girls all woodsy and outdoors but musky and it was really quite hard to place yet so constant and familiar i thought it was appropriate because that is how james was to me constant and familiar and it was comfort perhaps that thought that followed me in to sleep abc morning came dull and grey and warm there was no light streaming in my window no jarred awakening but instead some sweet smell coaxing me from my slumber i opened my eyes and saw remus standing beside the bed with two mugs in his hand one which he handed to me was tea with honey oh you re lovely i muttered as i sat up and took the tea gratefully sipping it immediately though it slightly burned my tongue i didntget the chance to speak to you at all yesterday i nearly forgot you were here until james said you were still asleep he watched me as i drank and blew on the tea to cool it and paid attention to him as he continued speaking and it just lily i glad you came he seems like he is coping and i cantimagine how i cantimagine doing the same i nodded and hurriedly swallowed my mouthful of tea for he was looking at me expectantly and he seemed i wasntsure worried or concerned no absolutely you re right he does seem like he is coping and please it as much to do with you boys as anything remus bowed his head at this and raised his mug to his mouth though he stopped short of taking a drink for perhaps the first time i felt the strangest the strongest flood of affection of endearment toward him he was not beyond emotion beyond guilt or loss and sometimes i forgot that but it struck me then that he was feeling it he was sharing it they did not need speak of it they were all so close and connected but remus was there experiencing the same pain the same void his friends were and it was admirable he knew mr potter and was as suddenly without him as everyone else was a part of me wished i knew how they felt but the other knew that i should never wish that sort of turmoil and pain upon anyone how are you holding up remus his eyes stormy blue and revealing as anything met mine over the rim of the cup and i knew how he was holding up without him having to speak it is unimaginable you have no idea what your reaction will be to something like this until it happens and it was happening now here and there and everywhere and it was not just this family something of a trend and perhaps others were dealing with more tragic deaths and i felt revolted at the thought that they should be thankful it was just a heart attack just a heart attack scary to think it was there were things so terrible going on that heart attacks seemed like a fairer death we did not speak again though he sat down on the bed with me as we drank our tea and found a paper to read which spoke of secret groups and dark movements and death after death there was something definitely chilling about it all of the trivial forgettable things i fretted over suddenly seemed just that my life seemed so small and petty compared to these big fighters and dedicated aurors and tragic endings i was not ashamed of that i did not wish for that to change i realized then that i was incredibly lucky to sit at hogwarts all safe and secure with head girl duties that i often slacked on and piles of homework that as the months wore on i completed half heartedly but i was content and lucky just very lucky if i had told remus of my revelation he would have looked me in the face and told me that i was lucky and it was about time i realized it he would have been glad i realized it too i never felt the need to share it though for to speak everything on one mind can put you in compromising situations later it was nice i figured to just be at peace with myself abc sound of settling by death cab for cutie abc april passed quickly with it seemed equal days of rain and sun grey skies and clear ones hell and hope and finished with a flourish offering three warm bright days in a row before fading into may often when months or years pass we forget or rather dontbother to sit and reflect or even consider how much time has passed and how quickly it has you end up realizing someday where you are and how you ve made it there and it all a bit overwhelming but i could not forget of april i could not help but think about it and reflect upon it and i wondered when it would quit looming when things would recover some normal pace or normalcy at all after mr potter death everything that had been on the brink for so long seemed to rush forth and the wizarding world was in upheaval perhaps i was just realizing it all i was just paying closer attention to the papers and the stories and the deaths or perhaps there was really more violence and there were really more deaths either way it was becoming difficult to ignore and it was just becoming a part of everyday i stayed with james after his father died until the end of the easter holidays mrs potter and lexi came and went though i had only seen them a handful of times and spoke to dani just once i told her i was sorry and she said so am i hugged me briefly and went on her way she seemed to be more protective of lexi rushing her around and making sure she was nearby i could understand though she had lost her husband and her son was barely two months away from graduation and his own life lexi was becoming her life support james did not stay terribly depressed for long he fell in and out of it much like bridget had after ray passed away some days he was so bright and cheerful smiling and lovely all round but others he grimaced and there were new creases on his forehead and at the corners of his eyes those days were rough ones because it did not matter who you were or if you had done anything you were bound to be yelled at and i was growing weary of feeling guilty for being angry with him his father death did not give him the right to verbally attack people whenever he felt like it but sometimes i thought maybe that was exactly his right there were times i avoided him completely too awkward and inexperienced to deal with everything he wanted to pile on me everything he wanted to shout at me it was this that once again gave sirius and me something in common he looked as good as ever and there was a week in april after jude had died where he looked dreadful but he somehow pulled dreadful off unkempt hair and a becoming beard dark circles and a scratchy voice it was like looking at him a few haggard years in the future and it was not bad at all we did not sit and talk about james or mr potter passing away or any of it like i had with remus i knew that sirius considered jude more a father than his own and it was sweet but also rather heart breaking it was something sacred perhaps between james and sirius and both remus and i knew there was no penetrating it no matter what they had gone through what rows they had there was something connecting them and i felt completely grateful they had one another he said that to you sirius asked as i approached him one evening in the common room relaying one of james tantrums off to him he looked as if he had been thoroughly and recently kissed hair a mess and lips pouted it still sent a jolt through me to see his eyes all wide and grey alluring i considered it a sign of growth when i realized it was bridget he had been thoroughly and recently kissing but was stricken with amusement instead of some buried jealousy he did i nodded pushing my hair back off of my face and sighing heavily it hard not to slap him about the face because i think he deserves it sirius moved from the armchair he was sitting in to the sofa i was on and instead of sharing me in a sigh he laughed you ve got to know he doesntmean it because how lame is the selfish bitch thing getting lily you are not selfish because you want to go study alone or eat your own dinner james is sounding a tad insecure to me i told him he was right just as bridget entered the common room and they both exchanged a huge genuine grin abc two weeks into may it was the sort of day that may was known for the grass was growing and green flowers blooming spectacularly and the sky the bluest clearest you ve ever seen it it was the kind of a day a girl could live for but james had a knack a tendency for ruining those lovely may afternoons and weekends this one was no exception when i arrived in his dormitory in a pair of denim shorts and a tshirt he was in bed covered from head to toe and had the hangings pulled the act of telling him in sing song voice how beautiful it was outside and how warm the sun was had long since worn off i tore the hangings back and folded my arms my ponytail swinging threateningly though i stood still let skive off homework and just spend the entire day outside yeah maybe we can get some sun even my freckles are pale i examined my outstretched arm and waited for something from him aside from a scowl when quite typically nothing was said just some groan of irritation i hauled the blankets off of him and tossed them to the foot of the bed lily just go away he said as i tried and failed to tug him out of the bed i not in the mood and before i knew it or considered it or even cared i was for a change shouting at him no of course you re not in the mood there sun out and it daytime so you must be miserable right now and it so bloody fantastic that it works out for you it all about when you re not in the mood to move or talk or do anything but if it a school night gone 2 a m and you want to sneak down to the kitchens or something well i better be in the mood or i a selfish bitch james sat up his black hair sticking up all over his glasses lopsided and his brow furrowed i feel completely guilty and terrible all of the time for you so i just sit here and wait for you to decide when things are going to be okay and when they re not i so exhausted though james i had gone from shouting and pacing to muttering and trembling we ve barely a month left here and i d like to spend it doing experiencing things remembering this place then maybe you should go find someone better to spend your time with my hands tugged my hair away from my face holding it there as i breathed breathed breathed the emotion in my voice was unexpected and unwanted but there nonetheless and my eyes stung my nose prickled as i felt the building of tears that the thing i said completely defeated sinking onto the edge of the bed and staring at the sheets instead of his face i dontwant to be around anyone else i dontwant to be with anyone else ever james i just i felt like saying it and i felt like crying and i did not know which to do i did not know whether to sit there or run away the last month had been strange and uncertain but also very bonding for us there was nothing specific no title we had to go by and even when he was irrational and angry i still felt for him i still stayed with him as a friend or more than i didntknow and most of the time i didntcare most of the time i kissed him when i felt like it and joked around with him when i felt like that there was no pressure and nobody cared anymore about the head girl and boy hooking up his friends were unconcerned and had their own lives their own things to worry about we were off of the radar and free to do whatever we pleased and the times that month when he was happy and well off were some of the best we ever had lily and he wasntangry or asking me to leave him alone anymore he wasntcold and distance but suddenly but wonderfully flushed in the face and hoarse in the voice and sitting up even straighter his hand seemed to find itself pressed against my arm shoulder neck of its own accord and james looked fascinated looked perplexed at the contact at the warmth of skin on skin it was as if he was realizing it that i had been there the last month and we were doing so great it was with his mouth against my neck fingers reaching for my own that he muttered my name again oh lily and then pulled back to stare into my eyes green green green he breathed brushing tendrils of hair off of my forehead i absolutely i know i just i love you abc same by snow patrol abc hey i hope this chapter wasnttoo delayed time is honestly escaping me and i am glad i got this chapter up now becaues i wontbe free for weeks now exams are this week and i have prom graduation everything else the next couple of weeks it is sort of emotional and intense but i ve made it this far enjoy this chapter i did if you have any questions donthesitate to review or email me thanks for all of the reviews i appreciate it kaitlyn chapter 3 birthdays integrity abc my sister forgot my grandparents always sent their letters to my parents to be further mailed to me and since my parents forgot well i wasntgoing to get anything from parents god damn fucking parents they were divorced i was so glad so so glad dontyou just expect your bloody mum to remember the date she gave birth to you no no of course not no she forgot she forgot it sucked so fucking much sitting there at breakfast on a monday knowing i was 18 but nobody else knew to top it all off i had potions first class with thoseslytherins god i was in such a horrid mood that i had taken 50 some points from my own bloody house well if they had remembered my birthday then we wouldnthave to deal with this would we on my way to potions with the usual morning crowd around me and i realized james potter was to the left of me i glanced sideways at him holding my books tighter against my chest and chewing my lip one half assed conversation and a month of casual greetings and here i was waiting for him to say something hoping he d notice me wondering what i could do to get his attention walking steadily faster then slower then faster again being so preoccupied with trying to get james to at least look my way i wasntlooking as i went to round a corner and ended up half crashing into the wall and stumbling over a short kid reaching out to the nearest thing to keep me from falling yeah and that nearest thing was james potter and he didntkeep me from falling we both ended up sprawled on the cold stone floor oh no oh no oh no god this isnthappening i bemoaned not making any attempts to move from the floor as i covered my face with my hands people had stopped for a moment to see why we were on the floor and if we were dead or anything but upon realizing we were in fact alive and i was just clumsy they continued on their way i waited until there were no footsteps anywhere near me and then i sat up and brushing my skirt off putting my hair behind my ears i saw james leaning against the wall with his arms folded and his foot tapping almost impatiently you could ve left i muttered beginning to gather my books and begging my cheeks to stop burning just wanted to make sure you d be able to walk not to mention get to your next class he frowned and peered at me wait are you drunk i laughed and i sounded sadistic and just pretty pathetic i wish i finished getting my books together yet stayed sitting cross legged in the middle of the hallway facing james he was still frowning and was chewing on his thumb nail and staring at me a bit too intently for my liking i suddenly became quite self concious and tugged on the hem of my skirt trying to have it cover my knees why are we still sitting here again james asked as if he had known in the first place but i didntknow either he didntneed to say it would ve been easier if he hadn t how damn embarrassing but no he sat with me as long as i stayed sitting there fighting off tears covering my legs cursing my clumsiness and for some reason found myself needing to work up courage enough to speak anymore to him you haventleft yet and i not leaving til you do because i so bloody embarassed i put my face in my hands again yet heard james laughing softly i peeked through my fingers and saw the little smirk on his face you tripped nothing to be embarrassed over and then it was all so very funny i began laughing until i was even more red in the face and found myself pressed up against the cold wall next to james tripped i bloody well went flying and flailing and sprawling oh god i sighed and tipped my head to the side letting my chin rest on my shoulder as i watched james smile though his eyes staying downcast you did yes flied flailed and sprawled james was quiet again and fiddling with his hands we should go to class i half heartedly suggested trying to pull my eyes away from his because he was just so damn mezmerizing it was incredible i dontreally want to today screw it i raised my eyebrows and wracked my brain for the last time james potter had missed a class not to mention a whole day of classes probably never are you crazy you have to go because i realized there wasntmuch of a reason for him to go he was head boy he was smart and he was a marauder he should miss class now and then because you ve because i i shrugged i dunno there nothing to do anyways good point we will go first tell me what bothering you though james was never one to be so direct especially with well me but i must ve been really showing through if james was asking i guess he noticed how i didntthrow a remark back right away and must ve thought i thought he was prying he became insecure once again if i can go that far and ask that kind of stuff that is you donthave to answer maybe i ve not won you over as much as i thought i had i smiled at him just honestly smiled and touched his arm briefly just to bring his hazel gaze back to mine what makes you think you ve won me over at all hmm i tilted my head the same direction as his mouth quirked up to the left you re here now arentyou he said quietly his almost smile could even be heard in his voice his deep kind of rugged voice yes i am but nothing wrong i fine honestly i i trailed off i mean i didntwant to start whining about it being my birthday and nobody caring because then i d sound like jada only they actually did forget it but james wouldntknow that would he it was just a birthday nothing really important nothing to bother him over but his eyes were reading me and scanning me and almost silently pleading with me just to tell him so he could stop acting so out of character how about i tell you it just has something to do with with the date today date i nodded and slowly stood james eyes never leaving me november 12th november 12th he repeated it a few times and then frowned i ll find out dontyou worry i will know by the end of today james grinned and we walked to class together i walked in a few seconds before him to look like we had been attending to serious head duties but seconds enough apart so the students wouldntget any ideas about us there were none to be had tomorrow was tuesday and tuesdays just suck so massively all day i just kept thinking of how i couldntwait for today to be over and then i d groan and realize there were still 4 days of this week left tuesday stupid stupid tuesdays at dinner i looked for some late post but alas nothing i felt so bloody alone i had the whole damn castle for company and james potter was so sweet today but i just sat there eating my potatos and chicken and not even tasting it it was that absolutely depressing when i was a child birthday were everything the best day of the year so fun and the whole family was together but it like that didntmatter anymore i was gone i was turning 18 too bad for me learn to suck it up and you know what i fucking well should i should get over it like james said to me that day get over it i d love to get over life not care move on i was stuck in this absolute rut and hadntan idea how to get out of it mainly because it seemed like i wanted to be in it wanted to be there stuck and lost alone and scared it seemed i would rather be there then be unhappy with people who didntreally care about me might as well be alone and satisfied to an extent i know i kept swallowing hard before i could take a bite of my food i know i closed my eyes for too long and when i opened them wanted to burst at the seams for still being seated in this damn great hall the damn great hall where everything that wasntgreat seemed to unfold i know i rubbed my temple a few times too many and i know i mindlessly dropped my fork with a clatter i know i shook my head and stared at the fork as if it was a fucking difficult task to pick it up i know sirius black was watching me and i know i really wished he wouldn t he got up from his end of the table disregarding his plate of food and he took the empty place next to me empty places next to me lily you dontreally look good rather sick actually do you want me to i cut him off with a bright false smile and watery eyes no no i fine i just the potatos taste kind of i couldntthink of anything cat ish cat fish he asked an eyebrow raised and looking genuinely confused no cat ish it a saying like dry and without flavour i quickly made it up and it sounded so stupid is that what a cat tastes like no you ve lost me ohkay but dontlie to me darling honestly you look like you re about to be sick at any given time another moment of weakness passed over me and my eyes watered more with tears stinging to embark on some tainted journey i refused of course it s well i spotted jada over laughing with the other 7th year girls and laughed sadly myself it was strange how i just wouldnttell james but you know sirius was silently persuasive one look to me with those azure blue eyes and i was gone it my birthday today i was sitting there before a quite vied for guy of hogwarts good looking and just naturally alluring recherch really and i could hardly imagine how desolated and just miserable i would look sat there in front of a handsome one a lonely little girl oh no sirius generously lashed eyelids fell shut and fluttered for a moment i didntneed to continue he knew nobody remembered he ventured after a couple of minutes of shaking his head and muttering obscenities under his breath not a soul i smiled a tried smile but ended up pushing my food away and propping my elbows on the table in order to cradle my head this isntany fair i was whining whatever for some reason it was like i would be allowed to whine or fall apart more so in front of sirius than in front of james impressions seemed lasting on james whilst sirius is so nonchalant that it like he seen many a person lose themselves as much as james was the strong silent type sirius allowed more flaws james was so bloody without flaws that it seemed wrong to ruin and taint who he was you know what it good you hardly ate anything because we he stood up and ran down to his end of the table retrieving his cloak gloves and scarf and running back to me are going to hogsmeade c mon he tugged me up from my slumped position and forced me to run out of the great hall with him not letting go of my hand attracting attention i sure sirius i hissed my free hand jumping to keep my skirt from flying higher than i wanted anyone to see it became apparent to me i was quite self concious around the marauders james sirius fixing my bloody skirt pulling it down so it d be longer what the hell we can t it a bleedin monday we re not allowed and he laughed see told ya you didntneed permission if you were with a marauder i turned to him and frowned slightly yeah you didntneed permission when you went through some underground tunnels had some magic map and an invisibility cloak i hadntrecovered from the shock i dontthink sirius just up and telling me these secrets the marauders have had for years it was strange you re crazy we shouldntbe here i cracked a smile though as sirius made a comment on how i was sounding more paranoid than james we had dashed to the gryffindor tower and i went to get my cloak and other things from the dorm when i came back down here he was with a handful of items i just followed him wherever we went and only cursed him a few times walking the streets of hogsmeade when everybody else was stuck back at hogwarts doing homework was oddly pleasing people bustled on by us and would smile and nod to sirius as if he was here much more than on some weekends so i ve already frozen my balls off oh god i shook my head so we can stop in at the three broomsticks after we ve gotten you a present hmm good what no sirius bringing me here is enough you dontneed to buy me anything he had walked off ahead of me in the direction of some cozy looking shop i watch the smirk form on his lips as i caught up with him you re with sirius black now luv i need to buy you as much as possible to make up for my lack of emotional input in everyday life he laughed or so says all of my ex girlfriends complained i bought them too much pish posh a smile tugged at my lips and i sighed happily as i shoved my gloved hands into my pockets so this was nice it just was there was no denying it the snow on the ground was nothing too deep just enough to leave a footprint in it crunched pleasurably under our feet the sky was a pale blue colour although there was an overpowering darkness creeping around from the edges of the sky and soon would completely engulf us oh i wanted to watch the sun set with sirius just because he d make it feel nice if that makes sense i felt rather beautiful the air smelled rather beautiful too a mixture of stinging cold sweet cinnamon and spicy scented candles which seemed to be coming from the shop he was leading me into the combination of scents that met my nose was overwhelming as soon as i took a step in i took a step back and allowed my nose to adjust to the aroma filled air sirius was coughing and it was a tad fake though i could understand where he was coming from it was dizzying wow i breathed my eyes roaming the shop and it shelves of candles and magical looking things and stuffed bears and sweets filled the register counter rich colours rich smells and an all around incredible atmosphere i walked down an aisle and removed my gloves so i could trace my hands over everything a plump woman with a curly mop of white hair stood at the end of the next aisle her smile was warm and suddenly so was everything about me may i help you she asked in a sweet but old voice i smiled sirius did the talking just looking for something the lady might like for her birthday he had taken his gloves off too and ran a hand back through his brown hair sending me a grin as the woman smiled i think i ve just the thing she pursed her lips for a moment considering me it seemed and then dissappeared off a few aisles over honestly sirius thank you it so warm and just inviting i dontwant to leave i tipped my head back to laugh my cheeks burning due to the heated shop and my becoming aware of the way sirius would look to me before any words could leave his mouth the woman had returned carrying a long thin box she pulled the top off and showed the contents to sirius who raised his eyebrows in surprised approval it was a long dainty silver necklace on the end hung a pendant of the prettiest blue colour the silver mold embeded the smooth stone and i realized it was exactly the colour of sirius black eyes sirius had quickly purchased the necklace after seeing the look of awe on my face and he kept it in the backpack he had brought to store the invisibility cloak until we were on our way back to the castle i hadntthanked him for it yet i know it was rude but i just didntknow how to the only person to know it was my birthday and the only person to buy me anything was this this boy who i was starting to see in a completely different light even if we were beginning to talk more and have some sort of half assed friendship i thought him to be a bit of a womanizer arrogant and well mean the day he had tied my shoes for me a month ago was when most of those assumptions were put to rest he wasntmean so far from it sweet and charming with a bit of an arrogant asshole streak in him but it was amusing as far as it goes for being a womanizer i was slowly deciding that i didntcare if he did have a lot of girlfriends i could see why girls probably just went out with him for the sake of saying they had we were a couple of minutes away from the three broomsticks and i stopped walking taking a deep breath trying to calm the butterflies in my stomach sirius he turned around to face me and tilted his head to the side grinning this sort of knowing grin at me lily he wasntgoing to make this easy i thought with a sigh listen the necklace is is beautiful just i dontknow it really incredible of you to bring me here thank he cut me off by beginning to walk again and taking my hand in his as he did so my eyes widened a bit and i tried to blink it away but it was different he had tugged my hand as we ran out of the great hall but his pace was slow and he just seemed to be drinking in everything around him at the moment holding my hand i hadntput my gloves back on after we left the shop but he had and there was some tingling warmth spreading from his hand to the very tips of my fingertips a shiver wracked my whole body and he gave my hand a gentle squeeze he pulled the door to the three broomsticks open and smiled a heart stopping smile at me you re welcome lily evans abc chapter 30 the good life abc dontwait by dashboard confessional abc there was nothing suffocating about may not like it was in the midst of summer all humid and close no breeze and no relief from the blazing heat may was a good month the best month the most forgiving it somehow offered cool and warmth in the same day comfortable ideal temperatures may was ideal that evening in may was one of those strange funny contrasts with the smell of spring the smell of faded heat still lingering in the air and crickets were chirping contently but with a refreshing breeze a damp fog swooping down i was wearing shorts but shivering had a sunburn but could see the stars as clearly as if it were a cold still december the whole day had been a strange funny contrast i thought for a boy who was so distant who was so determined on making it by himself he fell to the idea of love the whole i love you thing quite quickly i had figured it would be me it would be me standing awkwardly in some sort of inappropriate situation declaring my love for him and it would be too soon and too mumbled to seem sincere it would be i had figured a disaster it would be something i would put off for as long as possible but there he was laying it out on the line like he did it every day like he was comfortable with and happy about exposing bits of his soul like that saying it steadily saying it like the sort of realization that just knocks you over in the moment his eyes were hopeful hazel wide he had every right to expect some sort of response but i just stood up and tug tug tugged on my ponytail it was only a moment could have been an eternity before the door opened and james dorm mates came spilling in loud and obnoxious and since his mates consisted mostly of his fellow marauders it would have taken just a second for one of them to notice me so as any dumb founded girl would have i took the opportunity and slipped from the room breathing a bit heavy and somehow i avoided seeing james for the rest of the day that warm intoxicating lovely day i spent it with an unusually sirius free bridget and we sat by the lake and dipped our toes into the water a bit optimistic of us for it was still cold it was the sort of thing you discussed with your girl friends what do i do do i say it back oh my god am i not far far too young for this there was something disrespectful about it though something untrustworthy about it something that made me feel almost guilty for even thinking about telling her instead i sat quietly throughout the day and i could not imagine telling him the same thing i could not imagine looking james potter in the eye and telling him i loved him it seemed like i was dwelling on it too much to even know how i felt about him bridget was laughing her infectious pretty laugh and relaying a story of her day to me and the sun was sort of pulsating beating down on my body and it was warm comfort not unlike he was i did not know if that was enough or what it even meant standing there in the dorm that evening after a long day of sun and laughter i had decided to find him to at least dignify him with a response of some kind abc the story by brandi carlile abc the similarity the irony of the situation did not escape me as i stood there waiting for him it was just a couple of months ago that i had met him after a quidditch match and broken up with him and now i was standing there waiting for him after he had a late practice with a completely different intention when i saw him approaching i noticed it was with his typical sort of signature look the windswept hair quidditch garb covering his long lean frame shoulders broad broom thrown over them and a complete air of arrogant nonchalance surrounding him it was not anything new for james potter not something i hadntseen before and hadntrolled my eyes over but that evening the very sight of him had my breath catching in my chest painful for a moment and then bursting forth with a great gasp his teammates were all making their way up from the pitch as well and they seemed tired irritated and were muttering about their determined captain who was bringing up the rear i could not suppress a grin you could tell the season was winding down and the pressure was on when he kept the team practicing on a saturday until nine o clock oh familiar james said in mocking tones as he spotted me standing there he clutched a hand to his chest as if he were remembering some faded heartache are you here to tramp all over me again the fact he was smiling playful joking did not calm me any rather it sent a jolt through me my stomach flipping and flopping no words leaving my parted lips it struck me occurred to me that if of all my years at hogwarts there was something i could be remembered for a moment that would always stand vividly apart from the rest it would be this one it would be this moment standing in the becoming dark with the gryffindor quidditch captain who looked like a dark silhouette as he stood with his back to the fast sinking sun the starry sky beginning to blanket overhead of us and suddenly i felt reckless i felt stupid are you here to tramp all over me again he wasntforgetful he wasntabout to forget what had happened and the fact he had told me he loved me was hanging there the elephant in the room was i here to tramp all over him again i really did not want to be reckless with his feelings his heart i said nothing for a few moments and he let out a nervous little laugh i sweaty and dirty he gestured to his grimy hands and face and laughed again so i could meet you in the dorms after i ve had a shower aside from quidditch snogging you is my favourite thing to do his perverse comments were horribly endearing and the way he pushed his glasses back up his nose ruffled his hair and looked at me expectantly nearly ruined me james i was surprised to hear the lack of concern of worry in my tone instead uttering his name lightly and happily the wind blew my hair into my face and i tucked it behind my ears lowering my head and stepping closer to him my gaze still at my feet he set his broom on the ground and his newfound light heartedness was gone and his hazel eyes were gleaming behind his glasses and he was never one to be too optimistic but he had the sort of look that told he was hoping wishing but fighting it he did not accept disappointment when i said nothing again unable to find the words to share what i was thinking he had wrapped one arm around my waist resting his hand on my back and the other pushed my hair from my face again and he smelled like sweat and dirt and maybe just the outdoors there was something so indefinably james about it that i let him kiss my mouth his scruffy chin scratching my cheek his muddy fingers leaving a print upon it there really was not much more to it than that there never would be there didntneed to be what else could there be than this than him fleeting thoughts of the future and our youth and everything that i should be concerned about spun through my mind but none of it seemed that important anymore when he kissed me i thought of when i was younger how i loved to spend time with my sister wear dresses to church and fly kites until they were gone from sight james was with those things james was apart of the sacred sparing things that i treasured adored loved i love you okay i told him in a whisper because i was afraid to sound fake cheap like i was a liar i didntknow how to assure him to know that he knew so i squeezed his hand and kissed him again and the breeze was cool daylight had lost its battle to the night insects hummed and buzzed through the air and there was no need for doubt just then abc nothing like you i by the perishers abc june hit us hard and along with it was the stress anxiety pressure over our newts which were to be sat at the end of the month there was hardly time to recognize to accept or deal with the fact it was june of our seventh year seventh year final year to be a part of that time to be a student a gryffindor in a decade a year a time that was so unstable so tumultuous was strange difficult were we to worry about our classes and our friends boyfriends and our graduation or were we to worry about the dark movement the attacks and deaths and organizations to join would we be ignoring the problems the matters if we tried to go on with our lives to complete the education we had so eagerly sought so dedicatedly stuck with there were moments and as the weeks wore on those moments became more frequent when it did not make sense to me but i did not feel alone in it i knew i was not alone in it every single person felt the same way there was uncertainty shared amongst us and sometimes you just wanted to ask what should i do but never did as together as we were in it as united as we were you could not help but feel alienated by your own thoughts your own pride i found the cruelest thing about the month of june to be the weather which only grew fairer the deeper we were into the month the closer we were to summer but the closer we were to summer the closer we were to our examinations hardly a moment could be spared to spend outside in the sunshine though all of the time we spent longing for it just slowed us down in our revision gryffindor took the quidditch cup the first weekend in june and it had been a fine day with a blue sky sweaty brows and blinding sun the team took turns hoisting the cup into the air and bellowing their happiness their excitement over winning it when james grasped the cup in his hands and lifted it up above the crowd everyone chanted his name and there were shouts of how he was the greatest captain gryffindor had seen he made a brief speech about how much he loved the team and loved the game and urged them all to continue to beat slytherin out and i was startled to see his eyes shining a bit as if they were glazed over with tears i congratulated him and he kissed me to a chorus of catcalls there was butterbeer and firewhiskey making its way around the common room and as head boy and girl we looked the other way as everyone drank the night away it was funny to think that it would be the last time i would be apart of any quidditch cup celebrations in that common room with those people it was a far off reality that we were slowly becoming aware of it was that night that happy celebratory night in which sirius looked to me and with lidded eyes and breath reeking of alcohol told me his brother was a death eater sirius i said looking around the full common room for someone better suited to hear that sort of thing from him you donthave to he was smiling slightly and shook his head thick brown hair falling across his forehead and obscuring those piercing grey eyes can you believe it he slurred and really i couldnt it all seemed like some story we read in the papers something that happened to other people but not someone i knew to know that his brother his own flesh and blood that had beat him black and blue a few months ago was involved in that sort of thing was a death eater it was astonishing really my father wrote me and told me nearly almost congratulated me on being about to graduate and then sort of threw it in there reg has finally committed to his interest in the dark arts he joined the movement and is working with the group they call themselves death eaters he relayed and for a boy who was so very drunk he knew the words quite well which made me think he must have read them over and over again he paused tipped the bottle he was drinking from to his mouth and drained it before continuing it funny isntit my own brother a death eater you know what they do dontyou they kill pretty little muggles like you wizards too hell they re killin everybody as he trailed off slamming the bottle down onto the end table and apparently succumbing to the effects of alcohol i fully realized for the first time what was happening when he had said that killing muggles wizards everybody a chill had crept from my very core and as it crawled over me it left gooseflesh in its wake and i felt somehow a combination of helpless and weak but fierce and determined not funny no i murmured with closed eyes and a hand rubbing my throbbing forehead terrifying is all abc two weeks later we were drawing ever closer to the ungodly task of completing our newts and the intensity of it had cracked more than a few it was wearing on our professors as much as it was on us and we would all be so glad when it was finally over it was near the end of the week and we knew in just one more we would be through with it sitting and enjoying our remaining time at hogwarts most people had taken to studying in groups that night and it was after curfew so the common room was full to bursting with seventh years through the noise the muttering of spells and charms flashes and sparks coming from wands and commotion i noticed sirius coming from the boys dormitory carrying a wireless radio with him and calling to people to quiet down both bridget who i had been practicing with and myself turned to look at him curiously brow furrowed and wands dropped onto the table we were sitting at he did not explain what he was doing why he was apparently breaking out the wizarding wireless network at that hour of night or where he had gotten it but there seemed to be a tension an understanding shared through the room the radio crackled slightly before honing in and it gave me the eerie recollection of stormy nights spent with my family sitting in the living room with the radio turned on just quietly listening to the announcers and songs in order to wait out the thunder and lightning a man low deep voice resonated loudly around the room and i figured it was because no one was speaking or moving or hardly breathing the man paused cleared his throat you could hear parchment shuffling in the background and seemed to be coming to the end of something he had read off damn it we ve missed the names sirius muttered adjusting the dials and leaning in so close his ear was nearly pressed to the speakers his fellow marauders save for an apparently absent peter were gathered around the same table with hard fixed gazes on the device it like they all knew something we were all expecting to hear something and that concludes the up to date list of deceased though more details are pending the man rumbled smoothly almost mournfully if you are just joining us there been an attack muggles and wizards alike um at least four auror dead countless other ministry employees more than twenty muggle casualties and so far close to forty wizards have been confirmed dead the injured could be in the hundreds uh the culprits have not been apprehended his voice trailed away and it was obvious they were receiving details every minute because more voices could be heard in the background and still we all sat gravely quiet terrified to even begin to marvel over the events james looked at me from across the room pale faced and jaw clenched and i had never seen him look so beyond his age so mature and serious it was the second time in as many weeks that i was stricken with the gravity the enormity of what was going on around us to think i was once just preoccupied with boys and homework was almost laughable in between reports people muttered amongst themselves speculating over what had happened why it had happened there was no answer to it i sat horrified at the table with bridget unable to voice any of the disbelief outrage that was going on in my head books lay forgotten parchment strewn over the place and some people sat up all night listening they wanted more names needed to know every last detail their parents relatives could be dead so many people could be dead it was only when mcgonagall showed up in her dressing gown and cap demanding we shut the radio off and head off to bed that we did so it was her sharp stern voice that had caught us and brought us back from that low rumbling voice trying to reassure us metaphorically hold our hands through the whole terrible thing abc on my way up the stairs to the girls dormitory i looked back over my shoulder and saw now that mcgonagall had disappeared seeing fit that we were obeying her people regrouping back around the table heads bent low as they listened to the radio sirius still sat there as did remus and it was mostly boys except for james i hurried back down the stairs and then up to the boys dormitory slowly pushing open the door and listening for voices or a sign that there was more than james inside confirming he was alone i stepped in to the room and seemed to be completely engulfed by the darkness of it the common room had been well lit even as the late hour grew because so many of us were studying but the dorm was in total darkness i held my breath and stood still as i waited for my eyes to adjust looking around for him he pulled open the door to the bathroom letting the light from there flood out into the dorm and i gave a start as i turned to look at him for a moment i had forgotten why i had went up there what had just happened the question i was about to ask him died on my tongue because it was always rather lovely always rather pleasing to see him in all of his shirtless glory never were his abdominals overly defined too hard and chiseled to look well real but his stomach was toned nonetheless and his pajama pants hung so low on his hips that the lines of his pelvic muscles stuck out it was such a girl thing to be caught up over such a typical thing to notice but the strip of hair that trailed down his stomach from his navel to lower regions lily he shouted at me moving closer to me concern etched in his frowning face what are you doing are you all right yes fine sorry i said shaking my head a bit and finally meeting his eyes which were so delightfully hazel and searching that i felt my cheeks burn with embarrassment he continued to look perplexed why are you here and i knew he was trying quite hard to not sound rude or as if he wanted me to leave i just finally it hit me and i rounded on him as he was bent over his trunk putting his toothbrush away and looking for a tshirt what was that down there what going on is there something you know about it that no one else does my questions were so abrupt and shouted at him that he wheeled around looking alarmed there was an attack a massive attack i guess earlier tonight it would ve been around the time people were leaving work or muggles were sitting in traffic you know i think some auror had cornered a couple of of death eaters and you know they were dueling and it just grew and half of a building got blasted away i dontknow the whole story as he spoke i imagined blasts of colour and jets of sparks and people screaming it was so unimaginable but for some reason i could piece it together perfectly in my mind it was becoming easier to believe these stories it so terrible it so funny how how real it getting you know he looked real cut up for a moment as if he were afraid i was about to cry and james usually did well when it came to dealing with that sort of thing but he looked unsettled giving me time to regroup and let out a long breath i was beginning to feel jilted to feel awkward standing there in the dark dorm with him when with a hard sort of blazing look and much bobbing of his adam apple he pulled me to him and held tightly he was warm all over his long lean frame pressed flush against me and his hands crawling through my hair there going to be a revolt against it against the dark movement against him and these death eaters sirius brother i said with a gasp and he cut me off murmuring that he knew dumbledore organizing it he continued and one of his hands was still in my hair the other was resting beneath my shirt on my back softly tickling my spine i felt like staying there i felt like melting and falling for him completely for the first time he wants names it hard to do it has to be kept quiet he doesntwant the wrong people finding out lily if he talks to you you re head girl i think he will he going to ask if you re willing if you will i pulled back and looked into his face which was contorted with concern and some internal struggle his jaw clenched as he stared right back into my eyes and i nodded bowing my head and then pressing my mouth against his neck breathing deeply i will absolutely anything i can do i cantimagine not doing anything i cantimagine just standing idly by as i climbed into bed with him that night as he whispered things to me that pushed the events of the day that pushed all thoughts of newts from my mind and made me laugh i realized i had committed to something huge something important i had given james my word i had told him i loved him just a couple of weeks ago i felt different better hopeful perhaps it was a bit na ve a bit childish of me to believe that everything would be all right but when i was with him when i was talking to him and reassuring everything with him it was the easiest thing in the world to believe abc hey i had a lot of time without internet over the last couple of months so i had a lot of time just to write i hope i got this up quicker than usual because of that thanks for all of the congrats and well wishes with exams i got through everything fine i graduated and got all of that over with it a really great time i hope your summer are going well and i appreciate all of the reviews so much there was some confusion with the last chapter and i apologize for that because it was such an important chapter for lily james it was in fact james telling lily he loved her i know it was kind of vague as for this chapter i hope it not too long or anything i got a bit carried away toward the end it also got mushier the quicker i was writing haha i just wanted to get this chapter up and sometimes i like a little l j romance umm i didntcheck all of the facts i was sort of blindly writing i dontthink i messed anything too major up no big details are wrong i dontthink the chapter title might seem inapprorpriate the further into the chapter we go but when i started it that what i felt it was going to be about the good life i thought things were going to be going well for them but things always have a way of popping up when you re writing i think in a way it is the good life for a bit to lily things are just ideal for awhile okay overly long author note lyrics are on my livejournal take care chapter 31 echoes silence patience and grace abc weighty ghost by wintersleep abc i forgot what it felt like to live and live well i forgot what it felt like to really know myself to know what i was feeling or what i wanted or where i was going june was a month of selflessness of sacrifice i became so detached so unlike who i had been that it was strange to come back down to meet myself again newts and deaths were preoccupying my mind and i was not alone it we were leaving and the world was coming apart and there was no way to be at ease with it no way to handle it well there was constant tension constant worry and my head always felt heavy and if i tried to organize my mind tried to get a handle on everything i would end the night with a headache and abandoning my studies when the day of our newts came i was surprised as if it had sprung up without any warning as if we had not been preparing for it for weeks and weeks i was genuinely shocked when i woke that morning to realize i had to go and sit the last test of my hogwarts education my stomach knotted and turned and my hands shook over breakfast but it was a physical sort of nervous i had become strangely calm in my thoughts and i could not revise anymore there was no room left no desire left in me for it i sat and ate my toast and orange and bacon and did not wonder where james was did not talk endlessly or develop some other habit i just sat and ate and was uncertain if i had ever been more prepared for anything before in my life then it happened we were ushered into the great hall and sat at desks and we took our newts it was much like fifth year when we took the owls and i forgot that this was not fifth year and that we were not coming back it left me and when i would remember would realize the earth shattering change we were about to face i lost my breath and my heart would race and i was not entirely sure that it was fear or panic there was something exciting about it a girl passed out and it was warm and sunny in the great hall the ceiling taking on the magnificent appearance of blue blue sky and barely a cloud they took her from the hall and she was crying and i nearly smiled nearly laughed in the middle of the supposed most important test of my life because it didntseem all that important anymore for seven years we were building up to it making our way toward it for seven years all we were staring at were newts and futures and neither seemed very important anymore newts were pointless if we were not even going to have a future and i was not depressed not sad i was liberated and free and free impending doom was freedom somehow yes i found myself wasting minutes at a time as i took the test by setting my quill down and stretching the cramp out in my hand and just staring at james it was funny the quiet that sets about a place when you re taking a test and it was no different now though everything else was different the scholar atmosphere was much the same papers rustled and people coughed you never seem to have to cough until you re in the middle of an examination and the sun shone in your eyes because it was june and the summer solstice had passed and he looked better than ever his hair had grown out better now and it was untidy as ever but he was mature and handsome and if he shifted just the right way i could see his hazel eyes gleaming in the sunlight behind his thin black glasses i realized i could not remember ever seeing him without his glasses off he dropped his quill i bit my lip containing yet another grin and when he bent over to pick it up his shirt raised and revealed a bit of skin someone coughing brought me from my daze and i noticed i was not the only girl sitting there staring at james potter instead of writing my exam abc my one goal after having finished the examination i had rushed through the end because time was running out and the practical part had been fairly easy was to sit by the lake and dip my feet into it for likely the last time i was not worried about well a career a place to live a direction for my life to take but instead just sitting in the lasting sunlight and enjoying one of my last nights at the place i had faithfully called home for seven years i thought back over the last month and there was a particular conversation that i had with bridget that stuck out i had not told james and i was nervous to tell him and nervous to respond to her but it was probably going to be for the best it was probably what i had to do because he had never looked at me and reassured me of anything he did not say lily we re graduating but we re going to be all right and that made me sure that we werentgoing to be all right that he didntexpect us to be either the sun was hot and people were frolicking and were as aware of the end of an era as i was my plaid wool skirt itched and i would not miss the uniform the stiff white shirt and itchy wool skirt boring shoes and tie and even as i thought of it of my hate for it i knew i would miss it i would miss dressing like the schoolgirl everyday just as much as i would miss everything else i had stripped my shoes and stockings off and sat on a rock and the water was still cool it never did get overly hot in those parts in the summer but refreshing and i felt so relieved so happy to be done with the exam but absolutely uncertain about everything that was about to come graduation was the next day and then we were to spend our last night and then leave leave hogwarts and our friends and our beds and pack our things and start our lives start our lives i did not know how this was something that was supposed to make perfect sense so soon there was so much to take in and i was overwhelmed and understated at the same time i was leaving the only home i had really known loved it was when i saw him coming toward me smiling and glowing in the sun was when i realized that he too was a feeling of home i was leaving hogwarts i was moving on but if i could just keep james could just stay close i would never really lose that feeling of home hey i greeted and i could hear the affection in my voice as he joined me on the smooth rock by the lake how did you do not an idea he replied leaning in to give me a peck on the mouth not too concerned either what about you i just shrugged and looked at him a smile tearing at my lips and cheeks it was still so perfect to realize that i loved him not to mention how much i loved him he was without his friends and lately he hadntbeen they d be ever present and i was fond of them and cared for them and i remembered sometimes that thing between me and sirius that had come and gone nearly without reason a breeze blew across us and it was surprising to realize it was summer it was here so fast i did not understand time and the way it moved so quickly but then so slowly his tie was loosened and the buttons of his shirt unfastened at the collar he was still in uniform too and he had been this boy who could pull it off for years and years but he was not much of boy anymore he was much more and much better and i smiled against his lips as he leaned in to kiss me again and i could not imagine what he saw in me in the beginning what was appealing at all about a whiny scared girl james he had pulled back and pressed a kiss to my cheekbone and he was not overly affectionate with me he did not always grope me and when he did kiss me i was always still leaned in even after he d pulled away a hand back through his hair he turned away from me and stared out over the lake watching the giant squid move across the lake tentacles sticking high out of the water he was there but distant and distracted and i could not blame him just felt closer to him i sorry for this month he said before i could say what i needed to really honestly tell him i sorry for not hazel eyes back on me i ve not offered you an ounce of assurance i know we ve just been sort of going at this blind he tugged at his tie and i could imagine him tanned and toned and shirtless on a hot july today and my stomach dropped and my heart pounded and my mind was already singing regret regret regret even with the warmth from the sun the comfort of the cool grass on my feet and the burn of his lovely hazel eyes i could feel a chill creeping down my spine leaving little goose pimples in its wake lips pursed trying to contain the words ready to spring forth from them i reached a hand out and ran it over his neck beneath his collar and mussed up his hair bridget getting a place and i i just haventthought about any of it properly a home job money the only reasonable thing for me to do the only i going to split the rent with her get started that way i going to live with her abc assuming voldemort does us all in tomorrow i think i ll have faired well on my newts if i live to see the results well i buggered arenti sirius came sauntering down the grassy slope to the lake where james and i sat and he had a thin cigar dangling from his mouth all bogart like hear hear mate james greeted him and it was a snap of your fingers transition from the reserved state he had been in a moment before ignoring my news and jumping into conversation bit brutal eh sirius threw himself down onto the grass beside the two of us and chuckled a bit the cigar still hanging there the ash growing at the end of it i had some fun with the practical part poor bloke got his arse a bit singed from my curse i guess s pose it the end of an era isntit us marauders done with hogwarts strange he took a long drag from the cigar and offered it to james who took it dragged off it and with a sly sort of grin offered it to me i cocked an eyebrow and he blew smoke out in a straight puff whereas sirius sat making smoke rings against the light blue of the sky i took the cigar from him and put it into my mouth imitating sirius with his bogart ways and eliciting a near giggle from the two of them it tasted of a smoky vanilla in my mouth and i sucked deeply and blew the smoke in james direction kissing him on the mouth afterward terribly unattractive of women to smoke i think sirius commented grabbing the remainder of the cigar from between my fingers and finishing it off i can pull it off i laughed into james kiss looking at sirius over his shoulder as he trailed his fingers along my shoulder blades because really nothing look betters on a bloke than cancer a shrug from him and he tossed it into the lake leaning back on his elbows i did not understand the sudden calm and then next moment panic i did not understand how we had come to be comfortable the three of us and more than civil pleasant and friendly and enjoyable doesntmatter much i wouldntsay might as well go out in style could die tomorrow anyway sirius had never really expressed concern over the situation before never in the horribly pessimistic way that he was now he had never sat and said oh well we re going to die anyway it chilled me on that warm summer day to hear him talk so casually about being blasted away by some madman with a wand james said nothing to his friend for a few minutes and then remus showed up looking a bit flustered with his sandy hair sticking up straight as if he had run his hands back through it many times instead of talking about his indifference over how he faired on the exams like the rest of us he boasted that he was sure he had done fantastic and that if he did well on these he could get any damn job he wanted with the ministry getting a bit ahead of yourself moony said sirius as remus dug out his own smokes and i forgot that it was remus who smoked and it struck me as odd that sirius was now toting cigars around with him but i figured it was a sort of celebratory thing the ministry not about to hire a werewolf especially these days pause the ministry not about to hire a werewolf especially these days what three heads turned toward sirius remus had his wand pointed to his cigarette and was about to light it but instead ended up shooting the flame at his hand burning it and cursing james leapt into a series of profanities and i just sat curiously frowning not about to hire a werewolf you bastard james exclaimed looking genuinely shocked with his hazel eyes wide and his eyebrows disappearing behind his fringe how many god damn years have we known and you just fucking say it on the last day here boasted he had done well on the newts and if he did he could get any job he wanted with the ministry blimey sirius you cantjust got saying it you know let hope you re not a member of the order to end up tortured for information just going to spill stuff like that james pressed on and remus was interjecting curses every now and then both verbal and actual ones flying over sirius head as he dodged them any job he wanted with the ministry not about to hire a werewolf oh my god and it came in a rush memories of sickness and scars and missing boys and dead grandparents and an ill mum and pale skin dark circles full moons oh my god secrets and sneaking around and scheming and that damned map and the scandal in sixth year that was hushed up involving the three boys and severus snape full moons the whomping willow shrieking shack a terrified snape a nearly expelled sirius the rift between james and him that lasted weeks full moons scars oh my god his boggart was some kind of silvery orb and it hung there in the air before he vanished it and it was a moon wasntit a full moon and the boys were awkward and did not often answer questions and mcgonagall had hauled them back to the common room so many nights because they were out on the grounds and full moons and sick relatives and trips home during full moons and oh my god are you serious what on earth how is it even james really what did sirius mean honestly a werewolf i turned to remus and he winced and his hands were shaking as he sucked the life out the cigarette and it was what the hell could not be true are you serious surprised you haventtold the skirt before now not exactly how i imagined her finding out if she ever really needed to fuck sirius cantkeep your damn mouth shut around her remus mumbled and fumbled with his wand and shoved it into the pocket of his pants and pulled it out again and i had this vision of him with a snout and covered in hair and ripping some animal apart and i could not believe it this lot are animagi peter too shrieking shack love not haunted it my howls you hear once a month transformation a bit painful y see so this lot keeps me company as animagi pete the rat there a knot on the whomping willow he presses and then sirius dog and james stag can follow into it and come into the shack we roam and you re a werewolf i said staring i a werewolf abc it was funny that on one of my last nights there at hogwarts i would be taken aback surprised by the magical world once again i had spent seven years growing familiar with the idea of strange creatures and mythical ones actually existing i had gotten to a place of comfort with it had begun to accept that this was in fact real i was a witch and there were wizards and it was a strange twisted sort of world but an amazing one and remus lupin was a werewolf he would once a month turn into a snarling monster beneath the light of the full moon and with his friends by his side and would wreck havoc in the forbidden forest and throughout the village of hogsmeade remus lupin a werewolf the three other marauders illegal animagi i could not hide my astonishment of the fact and so many things began to make sense i remembered the incident in fifth year and james told it to me in detail sirius pranking ways turned sinister and severus snape stuck his nose where it was not wanted it all led to some horrible horrible incident and remus could have killed him and sirius should ve been expelled james told me what stopped snape from finding remus i whispered into the becoming dark of the warm summer night sitting next to james as people roamed the grounds and laughed and smoked and drank and somewhere in the back of my mind i was reminded of some curfew and i was head girl and it was really quite laughable he was quiet for a moment before looking over to where his friends were sitting with a group of fellow gryffindor and he bowed his head slightly ruffling his hair absently i did he said and i tilted my head and listening intently sirius told me what he had done god the stupid prat i thought realized you know remus would tear snape apart you saved him you saved your worst enemy james shook his head and i think i would have been happier more secure if he would talk louder boast about it or maybe acknowledge what i had told him about my moving in with bridget not as noble as you make it sound love his friends called him over and he went to them left me sitting there and i felt strange and guilty and in love i admired him wanted to be with him could not imagine leaving him and thought he was a good person a great person for everything he did and we were graduating and moving on and i was tired of thinking about it all abc the night had gotten late and i was exhausted and had studied for so many hours that week and the fresh air did something to my brain and pushed me even further to the brink needless to say i abandoned the impromptu celebrations early and made my way to the graciously empty boys dormitory i did not feel like seeing bridget that night and i knew it was not her fault for looking out for me for caring about what i did with my life but it seemed like maybe she did not trust me to make the right decisions when it came to james i climbed into his bed and felt sort of sick and light headed when i thought about the last few weeks when i thought that this would be the last night i d spend in his hogwarts bed the last night i d spend gloriously close to him even though he was not with me at the moment i was uncertain about everything i d decided on i felt like following him everywhere and it made no sense but in the wee hours of the morning it made absolute sense it seemed stupid that all of my plans and ambitions were gone and then i wondered if i ever had any plans or ambitions to begin with i could not understand the place i had gotten to i could not understand or deal with the fact that graduation was a day away graduation everything i had worked for was a day away and it did not matter much anymore no one was really concerned with it people were dying and i was bitter and disappointed with the way things were turning out but i did not have the right to be i should have been determined and fighting and doing anything i could to save save this world like james was going to do but i just wanted to be with him and be sad and maybe just forever young abc forever young by youth group abc hey i murmured voice thick with sleep as he climbed into the bed with me it was something i would never tire of to wake up next to him his warm weight next to me on the big bed s after four for chrissakes james groaned stretching out next to me his arms behind his head still down there drinking and smoking the whole lot of em got a bit nippy out on the grounds so we moved er inside where d you go you should ve stayed last we ll see of some of them i sure he rambled on and i turned next to him both of us atop the covers of the bed and both of us still wearing our uniforms though sloppily and missing ties and i was not sure if he was drunk or high or both but he looked tired and finished and like i felt like he never wanted to move from the bed i heard his shoes hit the floor and he turned to face me too and with a great sight he reached a hand out and ran it down my neck i love you another sigh and his eyes were heavy and his glasses crooked but he was so familiar and endearing and i was not sure where all of my affection for him came from a shiver went through me starting where his hand was on my neck and raising the hairs on the back of it leaving goose pimples in its wake there was something kind of different in his eyes as he leaned forward to kiss me and they were darker and so startling that i forgot to close my eyes and just stared as his warm mouth worked over mine and then i was shaking and pressing against him and my eyes fluttered shut bloody hell lily he muttered and his lips were still pressing against me and his breath was quicker and the dorm was empty and it was the first time i had really thought about it had really wanted to you you have the best james was hands now mouth open against my neck and he spoke in this strangled voice whispering more than anything fucking legs that i ve ever seen and he ran his hands not down but up from my knees and i gasped a little when he pushed my skirt up and his touch was burning and i was trembling and it was pathetic but amazing really i dontknow how i ve not done this before his glasses caught in my hair and pulled but his fingers were on my thighs and then i was gripping his shoulders and pushing him off of me so i could sit up and then his shirt was off on the floor and then his pants and he was in boxer shorts and my heart was leaping into my throat my stomach had dropped out long ago the talking stopped quickly after that because neither of us could breathe properly and he tugged the hangings shut and it was perfectly dark in the four poster and his skin was tanned already and i was white against him and he had his hands on my bare back and then unzipped my skirt and it was down my legs and gonegonegone i can t i dontwant to his lips were red and his face was unshaven and scratchy against my shoulder as he worked his hands down my sides and it tickeld but there was this feeling this inexplicable something in my stomach that made me feel a bit scared excited go too far just tell me shut up honestly just shut up and just oh he nipped at my neck and shifted on the bed sitting up for a moment and leaving me laying there exposed chest heaving and hair a wild wild mess against his pillow then he was above me and hands on my hips and kind of awkward and fumbling but he pulled me closer and nudged my legs apart with a hand on my thigh and i did not know what to do but reach for his glasses and put them somewhere i did not know and breathe breathe breathe it was not perfect but it was living it really was to be so close so close to him and there was nothing between us and it was salvation and oh i felt alive abc salvation by black rebel motorcycle club abc i should be studying for you know my exam tomorrow or the ones next week or at least doing something but it seems the only time i can write is when i procrastinating so i apologize for the wait but i seriously pulled this together in a couple of days it funny when it comes to you take care lyrics on the livejournal and i do recommend all of these songs and artists oh the title is umm it the title of the foo fighters latest album and the album is brilliant and i love the song home on it as well so there you are chapter 32 endings and beginnings abc new slang by the shins abc you oh you need to leave before before what was her name i could never remember anything when he was all over me and on top of me and hands and lips but really i wouldnthave it any other way he was comfort personified i swore before what and he spoke a bit too loud for the situation at hand flushed and breathless but he felt some kind of powerful i thought when he was with me like this before she gets home she might bring bring you know your your friend and that d be oh lips on my ear and neck and hands burning skin and it was too hot to be doing this too hot to be holed up in my tiny bedroom and doing things we had become accustom to doing in the dark trying to be quiet a bit awkward he grinned against my lips before rolling off of me and laying down should learn to knock i say have you ever walked in on them i scrunched my face up and he laughed and i had never seen him so carefree so affectionate before any hesitations i d had about graduating and moving on and leaving were unfounded because he was lovely and we were actually managing and it was better than before i missed hogwarts and it was an actual struggle not to think about it not to dwell on it looking at him through the dark of the room i thought of june and i thought of leaving he was gone from the bed the morning after and how he had even managed to remain conscious let alone leave me in his bed was beyond me it was graduation day he had to shower and comb his hair and look handsome for his mum when she arrived i felt sort of sick when he gave me that explanation i had asked him why he would have sex with me i recalled hissing it like that and then disappear barely four hours later at 8 o clock in the morning graduation was not until the afternoon and he was hung over and post coital but just up and left me i felt sick when he said well mum coming early his mum and his little sister were going to come and sit and watch him proudly they were of course going to be here and i d not even considered preparing for any family had not even considered anybody but the two of us oh i had said and shut down or what and i was ashamed and my cheeks burned and he smiled and kissed me and said he just did not want to wake me i had expected a row but he seemed to have had matured over night i was sure family was important to him and really it was not a bad quality to have and it was unfair that i was not understanding that i jumped to conclusions there was a lingering moment between us as we donned our robes and prepared for the ceremony in which i thought to ask how are you holding up because his dad had just died and he was going on without him and this i figured would be an important moment between father and son the dad was supposed to offer advice and give him an heirloom and tell him he was proud he was supposed to clap his son on the back and tell his wife that their boy would do fine and stand tall as he walked across the stage graduating was important significant life altering and though i was a bit numb to it a bit uncertain of what was to come afterwards i knew james must be torn up about it and i felt really quite useless and helpless when i could not bring myself to look in his face and ask if he was all right instead i squeezed his hand and we walked down to the great hall together the quiet between us during that day the morning after frightened yet calmed me all at once and then graduation happened the ceremony took place with a blur of words and tears and speeches and things that were really very meaningless our futures were not our own we were going to be fighting for the next generation we were going to be lucky to be alive in a few years let alone decades we the graduating class of 78 had the weight of the world on our shoulders it made me uncomfortable i felt unworthy i felt as if i were a letdown i did not know what i could do and it made no sense because james told me to join the order and talk to dumbledore but i wasntsure it was enough i did not think i had anything to offer when the ceremony ended as i mindlessly glided from the great hall to the stone steps leading away from the castle i felt this inexplicable serenity this dead calm greet me and i took a deep breath stopping before descending the steps as i saw james approaching me down the walk a bit were his mum and lexi chatting with remus parents and embracing sirius smiling and looking every bit as proud as i imagined she would you want to come to my place celebrate and what not he greeted jogging up the stairs and tugging at the collar of his robes the sun beat down on us and it was june and summer and to describe how i felt in that moment was difficult no no you know what you go and i going to head to the flat and check it out i ve not seen it yet so i kind of want to do that get settled he nodded and he did not look so great as i remembered his hair awkwardly flattened down and his mother lips staining his cheeks i remembered the way his eyes felt on me as he stepped close and i was hot and my face flushed and my hair frizzing and i smiled when he kissed me and said he would see me soon watching him walk away was the strangest thing but he did see me soon the next day in fact he helped me unpack and he took his shirt off and was tanned and freckles browned his shoulders and the sight of him was endearing as i served him lemonade and bad porno plot i said and he did not understand and i told him i didntbelieve just because he was a wizard he had not seen porn he grinned like the devil and we d never been so playful youthful so then it was three weeks into july and it was a hot month a beautiful summer he came over to the flat more often than i went to his place for some reason i felt returning there with his mum and his dad gone and sirius likely hanging around i felt it would be a step back i felt like it would reverse any growing up i d manage to do going back to his place of childhood james didntsay it but i thought maybe he felt the same i ve never walked in on them no actually i donteven know if they re like that do you they dontseem much like a couple do you think i asked and he shrugged yawned rumpled his hair they dontneed to be a couple to be doing that you know love i rolled my eyes swatted his hands away from my hips and turned to face him he seemed stuck he seemed happy sometimes but others just stuck he could be smiling and then completely serious and there was something unsaid between us but he seemed plagued with indecision i did not want to provoke it did not want to cause issue where there was none lily but that unsaid something came forth that night three weeks into july and there was a full moon coming up and we were spending time together before then because he was still completely devoted to his friends still with remus when he needed his friends james i was teasing but his eyes were lidded and he stared at my mouth and then nose and then directly into my eyes and he looked overwhelmed and maybe sad i have to go and as the words left his mouth i was not surprised expecting it even maybe the order it starting up and i know you dontwant to be a member yet and that fine you know i dontblame you i averted my eyes because i was still embarrassed that he was full of determination and heroism and i was not but it going to be hard for awhile dumbledore it s he actually wants me to go there this mission i s pose not a lot of details but i wontbe around here and if you have to go james then you have to go i murmured and put a hand to his chest and his heart was drumming rapidly against my fingertips i not going to tell you not to i not going to stop you from being oh nobel and brave i grinned but he swallowed hard and nodded and closed his eyes i love you lily and it d been said before and probably would again but i could feel it really feel it just then my eyes were wet and i kisskisskissed him a hundred times slept with him once more and he left the next day abc the angels hung around by rilo kiley abc it was the end of august nearly the first of september and i wondered what it would feel like to not be going back to hogwarts i wondered where i would be when the clock turned eleven and if i would feel it would feel the longing for that world and estrangement from it i got some strange creepy urge to go to platform 9 anyway and watch all of the smiling unaware students bound from their parents to the train scarcely remembering to wave them off i realized i was living in the past like no other and it had become a sad little dance that i enjoyed doing reliving my days at school remembering the happier times the better years the good friends it was not normal for one to dwell inside of their head so often bridget worked a lot she d gotten a job at the leaky cauldron and it was a good place for her to eavesdrop on conversations and find out things for the order that cloaked strangers unknowingly offered to her sometimes i forgot ray had been killed died back in january and she was so strong and prepared and i felt weak and petty compared to her if anyone should be afraid it should be someone who lost to the death eaters and dark movement but rather she just fought harder and sirius took every chance to point that out to me he too was apparently involved in the order but certainly not to the extent that james or even remus was i imagined it was a bit contradictory some would think that one black was in the order of the phoenix keen on defeating lord voldemort and death eaters and his own brother was one of them his own brother and bellatrix his cousin and countless others whom he shared blood with i imagined people had their doubts about him though he spent his whole life separating himself from his family he was a boy who never seemed to trust too deeply and i wondered if it was because no one trusted him but he d come over during the day when bridget was gone the two continued to carry on some thing some fling and i was certain they werentin love or even cared for one another i also did not know if they slept together or if they just holed up in her room and talked often they werenteven at the flat together sirius would come calling and then they d leave it was strange it was isolating it was the only thing i was curious about he d come over and drink my beer and eat my food and watch my muggle television and sometimes he d sit there and offer up any insult he could ask me how i was affording rent ask me what the hell i did with my day my months my summer because i did not have a job and i was not affiliated with the order he d offer up snide remarks over my and james relationship it d been a month since james left and i hadntheard a word from him i didntpay attention to sirius when he would start ranting at me i would sit quietly and read or whatever i had been doing and i wouldntoffer him any acknowledgement sometimes in my head i d be screaming back at him and telling him what a prick he d become but for some reason i just took the abuse and chalked it up to sirius needing the attention he hadntchanged much since we graduated hadntfound some previously foreign ambition and ran off to get a job or any of it he wasntexactly carefree for someone who had little responsibility and heaps of money he seemed to sit around as much as i did and i figured that he d had a falling out with remus too the only sort of change that happened in him was he seemed to be connecting with his inner black and acting a lot more bitter and like his abandoned family it was funny to me that in the middle of a hot sticky summer sirius did not wear shorts he d show up in a pair of ratty thread bare jeans and either a grey tshirt or a darker coloured one it was not entirely unbecoming his scruffy appearance but it was a bit far off from the standards he d held at hogwarts but i supposed we were all a bit far off from the standards we d held in school abc august was a stormy month and though i was eighteen years old and on my own i still felt childish when the wind would come up and the thunder would crack and lightening flash sirius seemed to be around a lot of the time when the sky would darken and thunderheads would roll in and each time it rained the grass would grow longer greener and it was hard to think of summer coming to an end are you afraid of thunderstorms he asked rather darkly one afternoon as the familiar rumble of thunder in the distance struck up no well i dontreally enjoy them at all i guess i told him sitting side by side on the couch he sipping a butterbeer and i had lemonade with our feet propped on the table and he clicked the television off when the lightening struck and we could see it was chain lightning connecting with the ground somewhere and i imagined the surge of electricity the jolt it would give if there were two people i thought who needed a jolt more than anyone it was us we d been leading sedentary lives and the thought of a vacation of travelling somewhere and enjoying the sun or the beach never occurred to me when james left it all seemed to stop and it was not much of a summer anymore sometimes we talked about remus and i was curious about his whole werewolf thing and i felt as if maybe it was being exploited in the order for that why they valued him most there were werewolves coming out and joining voldemort and they needed one of their kind to get in on it to find out the secrets he could not get a decent paying job or one at all but dumbledore seemed mighty prepared to send him out among killers to get the scoop i could not take a stand on the whole thing i looked to him as big drops of rain began pounding against the roof and windows and i wondered if this strange figment of sirius black was the only constant i had in my life at the moment i wondered if this relationship friendship was the only one i really relied on anymore and this was what we both had become abc where sirius and bridget had either failed or not bothered to try remus succeeded he showed up to my flat one evening in the autumn sometime near the end of september and the months had an extraordinary tendency to pass without my even being aware of it and well pointed me in the right direction since we had graduated i d hardly seen him it wasntsomething i was terribly heart broken about he did not take me finding out about his werewolf ways very well though it was sirius who had opened his big mouth and told me it somehow translated into being my fault i was sympathetic for him for a moment perhaps but he glared at me on graduation day and told me to keep it to myself he did not trust me with it and i was insulted but assured him i wouldnttell a soul i d been asleep on the couch when he showed up and it was sometime after eight and the sun was setting though there was still a nice glow to the darkening sky the weather was still nice not particularly warm but there had not been a frost yet i took that as a good sign and continued to slouch around in shorts and tank tops and i d gotten a rather respectable tan during the summer but had also managed to gain weight that what sitting around drinking with sirius or going to visit bridget at the pub had done to me lily wake up he demanded and it was gruff and muffled a cigarette between his lips and he rose his fingers to steady it as he took a drag off of it and where i had gained weight he had lost where i had tanned he had paled he looked beat up and horrible and i had learned to expect it around the full moon but he just looked down and out and i figured this is what the order had done to him i did not want to think of james and his handsome face and thick hair and how he might look now covered in bruises and cuts and wasting away to jagged cheekbones and protruding wrist bones i had not heard from him since he d left in july and if anyone else had they werenttelling me that would have been a positive of being in the order knowing how he was and where he was and what was going on in the world at first back in june i d just been afraid to join i just needed a little coaxing maybe and a little assurance and some information and i would have been fine but james left and that was one blow and graduating was another and feeling tragically alone was another and then any desire i d had to do something anything had left me and then i was just embarrassed i d started out afraid and then bitter and then just horribly embarrassed and ashamed with myself wake the hell up he said again and ashes dropped to the floor and burned a hole in the carpet as he tugged the pillow from beneath my head and thrust it onto my face i shouted startled and sat up with my heart beating rapidly against my chest you nearly gave me a bloody heart attack i cursed and threw the pillow at him hair a wild mess about my face what are you doing here he was dressed in some shabby robes and his face seemed suddenly and deeply lined for such a young man and i even thought i saw grey in his sandy blonde hair the empathy i expected to ebb back in for him didnthappen as i stared at his disheveled appearance i did not care he looked as if hell warmed over and i did not care he was doing god knows what for the order amongst dark wizards and bad bad men for once i thought i was as bitter toward him as he was to me you were the smartest damn witch in our year the past tense in his voice made me wince you were the most prepared the most ambitious girl i knew head girl honestly did you not have it all did you not have the brightest future of anyone and now what now this i thought that maybe i should have been feeling disappointed and ashamed in that moment but the more he spoke the angrier i became what of it i muttered crossing my arms and not wanting to be berated too for my appearance join the order remus said and there was a finality in his voice that suggested there was no other option or just sit around here i shrugged and he rolled his eyes and the living room was smoky and i willed bridget to come home and save me i think really this is your chance to start caring you had your right and your time to be heart broken and listless but it over now you need to start something or you re just going to bloody fade lily he looked exhausted as he finished his cigarette and snubbed it out against his sneaker and then tossed the butt into the rubbish bin by the sofa i was still angry but it was more because this was remus lupin talking to me and not someone else not someone who actually cared about me it took remus to knock sense into me to offer me advice and i felt my cheeks burn as he just stood staring at me okay i said nodding and standing all right fine abc do you think he ll notice what a god damn blimp i am i smoothed the creases from my skirt and tugged at my top and sucked my stomach in and hunched my shoulders up to try to regain the proportions i once had uh what do you mean sirius asked not bothering to look up from the paper i ve bloody well gained a hundred pounds do you think he ll notice he brought his gaze up beginning at my feet and trailing up my legs but not quite making it to my face instead lingering on my chest and not bothering to hide the fact bloody hell bloke ll have to be blind not to notice your tits are huge by the way hundred pounds really i turned in the mirror and cupped my breasts lifting them and screwing my face up obviously not really but enough shit i never had a generous sized chest nothing too remarkable about my measly a nearly b cup they were never my best assets never something boys seemed to notice or james had a particular appreciation for and now they were huge overflowing obscene pornographic i d bought an entire new wardrobe of bras and had never had cleavage before but now i could ve had cleavage in a turtleneck i swore i dontthink he going to quite mind lily sirius smirked but it was not just my chest my once flat but never toned stomach was now a bit paunchy and my hips curved out differently and my backside had even spread out who to say he ll even show up true i supposed it was my first meeting with the order and sirius had admitted that james and the rest who were off trotting around europe on mission would show up to the meetings sometimes and offer news and information he d only mentioned it after i had agreed to join and met with dumbledore he seemed to brighten up seemed to regain a semblance of who he d once been perhaps he was just lonely too so i went to the meeting and sat through the meeting and the things they spoke of were scary and real and my mind took awhile to connect the two i forgot that the attacks and deaths and disappearances they spoke of in a dimly lit full room were reality i forgot that there were things bigger than me out there more important than me and james did not show up abc it was a couple of weeks later into october and into wearing pants and long sleeved shirts again that i would finally see him the leaves had started turning and the sky was blue and the air crisp and he came stumbling back into my life i d taken a place at saint mungo s certainly not a healer complete lack of education for any job of that degree but i figured it was a position not quite equivalent to that of a muggle nurse i did not remove objects from anyone or try to reverse mentally damaging curses and did not perform healing charms on anything that i could not immediately identify i basically just sopped up blood and tried to fix cuts that did not turn colour or anything i ran around a lot and told healers where they were needed and sometimes there were secretive injuries that had occurred within the order and i had to conceal the patients and put them in some room where no other patients could find them and it was it was a lot and it was all of a sudden but it was work and it was distraction and it was gratifying the pay was modest next to nothing really and i did not need it terribly because my father had sent me a good sized cheque at graduation and i d been living off of that and was a sirius black in my own right i supposed and he seemed oddly proud of me seemed to consider me worthy of kindness and friendship again i told him i said you could ve told me i needed to get things together you could ve put me in my place before remus i would ve listened i would ve appreciated it when i saw james again when he showed up and came back it was late it was after midnight and i often was stuck with the shoddy hours that no one else wanted i d work over night or i d work early in the morning and i looked ragged and tired but had not lost any weight it was late and quiet and i was sitting sipping a coffee when i heard the doors to the emergency area open and i brushed a strand of hair from my damp forehead raised my eyes and saw his i stood dropped my coffee but waved my wand to catch it before it spilled and i walked toward him and it was the first time i felt my stomach drop first time i felt sick at the injuries before me and quite less than invincible lily the medi witch who was leading him in addressed myself and the others sitting around waiting for something to happen and motioned behind her for more to follow fair number of injuries you gotta clean em up fast and get them out of here get the worse off ones to healers it an order thing the other girls sped off to tend to the injuries and i stood awkwardly right in front of him and my heart was pounding painfully in my throat and sweat beaded on my forehead as i waved my wand and took control of the stretcher and got him out of the corridor oh god i murmured over and over and he was unconscious but i was protective and did not want to pass him off to a healer until i could see what was wrong and where all of that blood was coming from a warm seemed to spread from my heart through my veins when i heard him speak nice practical shoes there lily and they were white and typical for that profession and splattered in his blood he was not smiling but grimacing and he was a greenish pale and he was out again as i set to work on his gaping chest wounds hardly daring to breathe as he gasped in pain and i did not want to kill him so i shouted for a healer and nearly collapsed the moment i was out of the room i remembered what it was like to love him sick with worry and wanting nothing more in that moment for him to quit bleeding and just come home abc home by foo fighters abc hey guys so i want to apologize for some confusion with this chapter originally i posted it yesterday at around 3 a m and was tired and in a hurry i noticed when i was going through it though that i hadntedited some of it and some parts had gotten cut out and mixed up so instead of fixing it last night i just removed it but here it is hopefully complete and not messed up there are two versions of this chapter which is something for me but i reworked the first part and it actually helped rewriting it if only i had the time to rewrite everything i on spring break reading week right now so i found the time to do this though i should ve been doing assignments becaues i knew if i did not write a chapter soon i wouldntget a chance to the next couple of months are busy so i wanted to offer something enjoy i think it kind of a transition chapter and sets it up nicely for the next one which should be more interesting and i think you should expect in a few chapters for it to come to an end when i get to the right point i ll know i suppose thanks to those who do review i really appreciate it kaitlyn chapter 33 with arms outstretched abc with arms outstretched by rilo kiley abc there was a day in october that was unusually warm and out of place for the autumn season it was a step back to the middle of july and hot summer days warm summer nights the air was warm and hung still no crisp breeze forcing sweaters onto bodies it was a strange thing i thought the warm air pulsing sun with the leaves turning colour and falling down that day it seemed more than just myself felt out of place i woke that morning and i felt confused to hear birds through the window found my bedroom was stifling and had to let the window open the chirping grew louder and it was a happy sound a lovely thing to hear the sky was blue but not autumn blue and somehow there is a difference between autumn blue skies and summer blue skies it was a summer blue sky and i wondered what sort of magic had been worked on me while i slept it was similar i thought to being a child in the muggle world and turning the television on in summer and seeing an old episode from christmastime and you were sitting there beading with sweat but they were bundled up with scarves and hot cocoa on the screen as a child it played with your mind and i found the remarkable weather doing the same for me that day somehow i found my mind wandering to people in warm climates and how they dealt with that sort of thing what it was like to wake on christmas and see nothing but sunshine and green grass i did not know if i could adjust if my feeling of displacement would fade i was feeling displaced for more than that however and sighed and left my bedroom to descend the stairs to a quiet empty flat bridget was gone and she was not often there but i just went to the kitchen and prepared some fresh fruit melon and oranges was all we had and a glass of iced tea dressed inappropriately for the season but fitting for the weather in a red one piece that extended into boyshorts i felt glamorous in the one piece and my big round sunglasses glamorous and alone yet oddly content i took my fruit and drink out to our small back deck it was really just a set of steps descending into the slight backyard we had and sat myself in the warm sun james had been injured probably about three days ago and i d contacted sirius as soon as i d gotten sense back to me and the two of us sat together through the night we d fallen asleep awkwardly in the chairs and it worried me so deeply that no one had come through the doors to tell us anything since they d taken him in perhaps it was private or secret or just too gruesome to share perhaps they had not expected me to stick around or did not even know who he was to me after we had woke though at around 5 in the morning sirius with a hoarse gruff voice said he d be right back and left through the doors to find something out in the five to ten minutes that he was gone none other than mrs potter showed up my face fell and i realized i was daft for not calling on her first and i looked around wildly for somewhere to disappear to too late she spotted me dani demanded some information from me a healer or an order member had sent word to her and i told her i did not know anything when she finally did find out what was happening how he was she returned she was dressed in an elegant set of mauve robes and her hair was set in curls and her lips painted and i felt disheveled next to her embarrassingly realizing that his blood still covered my shoes and banished me from the hospital telling me not to visit him again if i was just going to be useless in it all so i did not visit him again he was alive and he was groggy and in pain and they d mended as much as they could but it would take weeks and weeks for him to fully recover sirius delivered me the message before mrs potter personally escorted me away from the ward and i apparated home i stared back helplessly at him but felt a bit hopeful that at least he cared if i knew what was happening or not and sirius did send me owls throughout the days that i had been away from the hospital i even dropped out on my shifts for those days he told me there was not much of a change and there wouldntbe and james wasntcompletely comprehensive so he hadntsaid much but the moment he asked for me sirius promised he d come get me himself i was perhaps angry that mrs potter so easily disregarded me but then i did not really blame her because who was i to her james had left and we did love one another had been in love at some point but he d been gone so very long it was understandable that she did not consider me important in it all i had just sat there and could tell her nothing about it so she sent me away she was his mum she did want what was best for him i wondered if someday i would be able to understand where dani was coming from how a mother mind worked it was scary to think about since we had graduated since james had left i had sort of begun my gradual descent back into a muggle life i still used my magic and carried my wand but chose to have electricity and a television and a radio i liked the idea of having a phone to communicate but since no one else did nor did we our lack of phone and possession of an owl was really the only thing remotely witch like about our flat bridget was pureblood but also interested in electricity and things and embraced the idea of outside entertainment i felt guilty for my temporary abandonment of most things magical and i still appreciated being a witch still reflected warmly on my years at hogwarts but i figured that since i had managed to essentially get stuck in my post hogwarts life i should try something different something different but familiar something that was a lost part of me and maybe in order to fix who i was now i didntknow i was grasping at straws i laughed to myself as my thoughts got carried away and i sipped my iced tea and leaned my head back and thought of peace and change and how i could hear an aeroplane overhead and whenever i did whenever that connection with the muggle world was brought up i felt this overwhelming sense of loss of sadness of freedom i squinted over my sunglasses and followed the contrail with my eyes and breathed deep and let get this together lily abc big guns by jenny lewis with the watson twins abc shit i dontknow how to do the heimlich maneuver we learned about it in muggle studies only reason i know what it called there must be a spell to get it out of you right shit i was choking on an iced cube sirius had popped in literally arriving directly behind me and shouting my name and startling me so badly i sucked in the iced cube that i had sipped from my glass and it immediately lodged painfully in my throat can you do it yourself he asked near hysterics standing with his wand pointed at me but with no idea what to do i grabbed onto his shirt and hauled myself up from the step sweat beading on my forehead and threw myself at the railing jerking it up under my ribcage until the iced cube flew from my throat gasping and clutching my throat i turned on him and jabbed his adam apple how it feel i asked angrily throwing my sunglasses off and glaring at him my hair sticking to my damp face you were entirely still unable to catch my breath for every time i took one the pain from the where ice had been stole it useless i could have died he stared at me one hand on his own throat and the other holding my sunglasses he had caught it would ve melted eventually sirius said lamely and i closed my eyes raising a shaky hand to tug my hair back sorry he added sheepishly and he did look it i relaxed and leaned against the rail folding my arms and raising an eyebrow at him aside from the fact i nearly met my end while he stood by like an arsehole it was kind of amusing to see sirius black in a state of panic his face all screwed up and he looked about eight when he tugged on his hair alright then he cautioned and i nodded rubbing my neck and shoulder i realized i probably looked kind of amusing as well wearing a one piece hot pantsed swimsuit in the middle of october my white freckled skin nearly florescent in the bright sunlight well i have some news he started and took a place leaning on the opposite rail to mine first of all we caught some death eaters and by we you know i mean the order and whoever the hell did it because it wasntme but props to them yeah revenge and all of that injured some of our best guys second of all mrs potter was kind out of line with the whole get out of this hospital that you work in and is open to the public and do not come back thing and she probably is sorry but you know her husband dead and james is old enough that he doesnthave to listen to her and i guess you re the only one she can really lay the iron fist down on third of all and you ll probably be happy about this one james is awake his enthusiasm was endearing and aware of what going on for once and he in pain and stuff but he talking and remembers what happen so it a good thing he getting better i stared at him and frowned and nodded and then leapt into his arms and embraced him and kissed his cheek and said thank god over and over again oh and he asked where you are sirius grinned and then for the first time looked down at what i was wearing and what the hell do you have on are you wearing a swimsuit in october he looked cheerful as he asked it and i reminded him that he nearly let me choke to death before apparating directly to the potter household i was familiar enough with it by now that i knew which floor james bedroom was on and i went directly there avoiding any lurking dani potter unless she was actually at his bedside his door was open slightly and i peered inside before entering checking that his mum was in fact not present i knocked and was breathless as i entered the dark bedroom and there was a chill to it that was not in the outside air i rubbed my arms as i approached his bed and i was sitting on the edge of it before he opened his eyes and looked at me lily hi james said quietly eyes wide and i swallowed and smiled reaching a hand out to squeeze his leg heard you were the first to try to stitch me back together he quirked his lips at me and put his hand over my own my heart and stomach both leapt and i was glad that those feelings had not left me yeah dontyou remember you made a quip about my shoes i smiled further and took a few deep breaths before leaning toward him and pressing my lips to his brow looking him closely in the eyes scarcely how prickish of me the first words i get to say to you in months is about your attire he chuckled quietly and he might have been awake and better but he still looked hellish pale and in pain there was only so much that even magical medicine could do i supposed you bled all over those shoes i threw them out rather than clean them it was true and he looked concerned tugging me closer until i crawled up the bed and curled into him i sorry for scaring you he muttered and i found comfort in the arm he wrapped around my back in the way my head went to his chest and his breathing was slow and steady and reassuring got scared myself too i nodded against him and inhaled his clean fresh but slightly musky scent and could not imagine how i survived without him for all of those months it felt like years he seemed so older now i glad you re okay james seemed perhaps to be in a sensitive frame of mind because i heard him swallow a few times and he choked on his words i ve missed you so much and i kissed his neck gently my eyelashes fluttering against his chin as i looked up at him he was strong but just momentarily broken and i had entire immense hope and expectations that he would be okay he would pull through this for the better i wondered as we quietly lay in his dark chilly room if he would leave again once he was better or if he d play the hero and leave before he was even fully healed i wondered if dumbledore and the order would give him a break or if he d done good enough work that they were going to send him off again i did not even fully know what he had been doing what sort of mission he d been on i didntknow it had been that dangerous i assumed he purposely failed to inform me of that mum out said she wanted to pick some things up for me if you re wondering he gave me a grin and squeezed my shoulder as i sighed or what is it that bothering you i stayed silent for a moment pulling away from him and sitting cross legged beside him rubbing my palms down my bare legs it just that i ve sort of been in this hole since you left i did get the job at saint mungo and i did i dontknow enjoy my summer a bit but i can not imagine losing you again i cantimagine having to say goodbye again and keep saying goodbye until you come back to me bloody dismembered james gave a curt nod and pressed his lips tight together bowing his head and looking at his hands he was propped up against the backboard with a couple of pillows in behind him and he looked smothered in pillows and duvets and there were three different cups on his bedside stand one with orange juice another with iced water and a straw the third was a mug of coffee or tea and i could just imagine mrs potter doting on him could you let open the window a bit stuffy in here i ve not moved in two days now just sort of wallowing in my own stink he scrunched his nose and i nodded crawling out of the bed and going to the window to pull back the curtains and push the heavy window up the sun instantly lit up the room and the warm air from outside streamed in but brought with it a bit of freshness james blinked against the light as it washed across his bed and beamed into his eyes he took a deep breath and then looked at me standing in front of the window and relishing the feel of the warmth on my body you look rather spectacularly hot right now he said curiously tilting his head as he watched me i put my hair behind my ears and brushed my bangs aside that a onepiece in october he laughed a hoarse laugh and i shrugged it is summertime warm out i swear and he laughed again and i appreciated seeing the crinkly smile on his face oh yeah turn around he made a twirling motion with his hand and up on tiptoes hands out to the side as if i were a ballerina i turned on the spot and stopped when i was back to him i looked over my shoulder and raised my eyebrows to which he nodded approvingly and i laughed well you re sure dressed as if it summertime warm out it felt playful with him again youthful it felt like it had before he left that day was a strange strange step back in time and your legs holy hell lily i dontcare if it thirty below zero in the middle of a blizzard you are never to wear pants again i felt silly i felt giddy my heart was drumming in my chest as i looked at him there was no way really to explain how i was feeling it was relief it was affection he was everything i had been missing when i rejoined him on the bed i sat next to him and crossed one of my legs over his torso both of his hands grasped it and rubbed up and down i laid a hand against his chest and he winced slightly but settled into it as i glided it up to his neck and then face his eyes were hazel and alight and made my cheeks tingle with colour as they bore into my own i wanted to kiss him he did kiss me and it was the familiar something i d forgotten of and his lips were kind of dry and his face scratchy against my own but i did not care it felt lovely and i wanted to be as close as possible to him we can t james gasped against my mouth and i d managed to get his arms out of his shirt and up around his neck and when he pulled away i pulled away and gasped myself when i looked at his chest oh my god the wounds were bandaged but obviously weeping through the bandages and it was a bloody greenish colour and i d never seen magically induced wounds before and it was rough well no i d be willing to suffer through the pain of those i just mean well apparently i lucky to even be conscience right now so i dontreally want to faint or seizure on you yeah and my mum could be back at any moment speak of the devil her voice echoed up the hall and i put a hand over my mouth looked wildly around and considered the situation we were in i could not stay not in this skimpy little bathing suit that showed off all the weight i d gained in one place particularly not with james shirt around his neck and not with her well hating me i wondered when i would see him again if i left now owl me or have sirius do it or something i jumped from the bed and straightened myself preparing to disapparate home lily i love you and maybe we can get married or something i had disappeared before i could even react or even be sure that i had heard him married did he say hey there what re you wearing do you want an early dinner i made a salad could have some chicken with it open a bottle of wine lily bridget i went to find her in the kitchen once arriving back to the flat and my heart was hammering hard and i found my breath coming in quick little bursts bridget james is he alright she exclaimed and i noticed that sirius was there too and i held a hand up to stop her trying to catch my breath he doing better awake and bridget i think he might ve just proposed abc more adventurous by rilo kiley abc hey summertime happiness writing so enjoy thanks to reviews they re appreciated ps i really digging rilo kiley newest album under the blacklight also i rediscovering rabbit fur coat and sun sun sun by jenny lewis with the watson twins the elected respectively and am in love with the albums once again check em out chapter 34 free bird abc when i go by slow club abc near the end of october sometime after i d seen james and before halloween i fell ill it was the kind of ill i hadntexperienced before some sort of wretched torture on my mind and body i had spent a couple of times sick in bed at hogwarts with the flu and as a child i d get a chest infection every winter i swear but this was some painful combination of every kind of bad i had ever felt healers told me i d likely picked something up wandering around st mungo and i was contagious and infected and couldntwork and couldntleave my bedroom not to mention the flat i had a itchy burning rash over my neck and chest and my throat was painful and swollen my head throbbed and my stomach turned and i vomited at the slightest suggestion of food i spent days dehydrated and feverish and desperate for sleep that rarely came i was miserable and ill and james potter proposal was far from my mind the medication i took had awful side effects and burned on the way down making my throat more raw and scratchy oftentimes back up the medicine would come and i d have to choke down another dose of it and i figured magic was useful for this sort of thing but whatever illness i had wasntgoing away easily bridget with her face covered so she wouldnthave to share my air would tend to me most nights and give me whatever i needed but she didntwant to get sick so she stayed away as much as she could and i spent days and days over a week just lying there helplessly waving my wand and cleaning up my own sick james proposal had it been a proposal lingered in the back of my mind a bit and when i did think about it when my feverish head did recall his words i wondered if they were real or some vague hallucination i d had when my fever developed my head burned and dripped with sweat that gathered on my back and chilled my body and then i would forget about it and forget about him and what kind of girl disregarded a marriage proposal immediately after i d left james bedroom that day i was greeted with bridget and sirius preparing to have dinner and once i had told them about the proposal sirius had sat me down looked me in the eyes and said he completely doubted james would be mad enough to suggest marriage i promised that what james had said and sirius gently as if he were talking to an oblivious widow told me i was wrong and i wasntgoing to marry james i thought maybe sirius saying that prior to my illness had it carry over into my illness and that was where my doubt my hallucinations my detachment came from merlinbloodychristhell i gasped in one breath voice hoarse and quiet and throat burning unpleasantly from the action sirius stood at my bedroom door on halloween afternoon dressed in some costume that was a bit too realistic given his head looked partially severed at the neck not unlike nearly headless nick gryffindor ghost pretty good eh he looked oddly transparent as well i didntfind it particularly amusing shut up i rasped massaging my chest and it had been over a week since i d fell ill and a couple of days since i was contagious you terrified me that what i going for sirius grinned and he adjusted his costume a bit as i propped myself up against the pillows not sure where exactly i headed to bridget mentioned some kind of party somewhere he shrugged i offered a nod and said i sure they d have fun and you my dear could pull this costume off yourself still look as if death warmed over ever the flatterer i sighed and i had all of those post illness feelings hair a matted mess skin kind of greasy horrible taste in my mouth and my head felt heavy and throbbed if i moved too quickly my lips were dry and skin pale and it irritated me to see sirius smile he flashed his white teeth again and glanced at himself in the mirror before retreating from the doorway but paused and turned back for a moment if you feel you can make it downstairs you might have some company at some point in the evening abc oh he looked good recovered and well and tan and lean his hair was a shaggy black mess and his glasses kept sliding down his nose as he stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up at me he wore jeans and a grey tshirt and i did not think i d ever seen him look so good he always looked some kind of good but he looked genuinely handsome that day and his hazel eyes were alight behind his frames you ve been ill he said and i nodded descending a couple of stairs sirius and bridget had left a couple of hours ago and i had been preparing to drag myself downstairs to the kitchen when i heard someone enter the flat and there were only a select few who could do so my first thought was that i hoped it not to be remus because his company was often stressful albeit enlightening and he had come to visit a couple of times while i was sick but he basically talked mission and order and i was bored but also glad that the news of james proposal had not been passed on to him i could not imagine what he would have to say i ve come to visit a couple of times just got the okay myself to get out of bed you ve been out of commission each time though definitely worried about you i smiled and met him at the bottom of the stairs no one said you d been to visit i likely would have felt a bit better knowing you were better too your mum finally off your back a bit he dragged a hand back through his thick tangled hair and nodded not got much of a choice she hasn t healer said i fine i can do as i please james smiled all white teeth and high cheekbones the angles of that boys features often had me in fits of jealousy we went to the living room to sit and the sun was just starting to set and it really was a perfect evening there was a chill to the air that came with autumn but the sun shone strong and the sky had been blue and leaves rustled and fell and it startled me to realize it was autumn again already autumn again not a second after we d sat together on the sofa james had stood back up and his hand was through his hair again and he rubbed his neck and then his face he did not look at me and i dreaded to hear any further bad news from his mouth so so what ve you been doing i mean well you ve been ill but b but what did you do while you were in bed it was painful to watch him face contorted and frowning eyes squinted up as he looked to me and then back at nothing uh i faltered for a moment and blinked up at him i just kind of laid in bed and vomited and listened to my beatles and joni mitchell records his strange jumpy expression relaxed and he grinned at me oh it warmed my heart beetles beatles how do you listen to beetles the beatles his grin widened as i emphasized and i know you know what records are you did take years of muggle studies they re a band are they and what joni mitchell a band as well she a singer this lovely free bird of a canadian i could listen to her for a lifetime i sensed i looked like some innocent little child as i was on the sofa looking up at him talking about music artists i was passionate about at least before i went off to hogwarts and could still relate to could still find familiarity in you re lovely lovelier than any free bird of a canadian he looked almost desperate as he pressed on there ve been that goddamned prick snape is a death eater something twinged inside of me as james said his name and i imagined the boy i had gone to school with working for the dark movement did you know that lily he a death eater of the worst sorts and i d just like to james trailed off and paused and breathed and his eyes had flashed angry and the words he spoke had been spat out behind bared teeth and a clenched jaw and the hate there was for snape in school was so much more now james spoke of him in a murderous tone and it was actually quite frightening it just that there ve been more muggle attacks no one died lately none of our at least but lily when i suddenly i was quite nervous and unsteady and my heart drummed wildly against my chest pumping loud in my ears james it was a warning a cautious utter of his name to tell him to stop before he went too far before he said something he regretted i d been kind in not mentioning what we both knew i should ve mentioned i had been kind in pretending to forget he swallowed hard and his adam apple twitched and there was an expression of utmost concentration on his face as he shook his head and stopped me from saying anything else i felt and saw in the moment that he paused everything i d been through in the last year sirius and the first kiss james and our change from indifference to appreciation and friendship and eventually love i thought of my parents and my progression from bitter abandoned misunderstood teenager to gracious and accepting of where my life was going i felt better off for having lost them for awhile i felt as if i had to mature had to grow up and move on and i did not miss my parents as much as a young woman likely should have i missed my sister though and the kind soul she had been when we were children i missed that instant connection that bond and i missed my grandparents and those places those people seemed so apart from me so a piece of a different life a different person it was jarring nearly worrisome to consider the stark changes that had happened in my life i felt but a ghost of myself in that moment though with james turning to look at me hair a shaggy thick ruffled mess and his eyes blazing and burning hazel i could not consider the changes or differences in myself as bad things i felt liberated absolutely free and reborn to think i d come so far i d changed so much and tried to embrace so much to think of what james was about to ask me to think of the response i was about to provide it was difficult to want to let that freedom go to simply give it up the second after i d finally realized it discovered it he dropped to his knee with furrowed brow as i breathed deep and closed my eyes and imagined a future abc it was love by the elected abc sirius sirius we d made an agreement we had spent the entire day and night together and laid and talked and made love and worried and laughed and we made an agreement you tell sirius remus and pete i ll tell my mum sound good no it didn t really i could handle little peter pettigrew i assumed he would be happy for us but sirius and remus i really was uncertain uneasy uncomfortable with but with whom would i be more uncomfortable the two of them or the mrs potter well that was a question to which the answer was obvious but i didntknow why it had to be ruined so quickly i didntunderstand his need to plunge back into reality without hardly enjoying the happiness we d found i guess he was practical and reasonable whereas i was just desperate for an escape glad to have him back there was always someone other than ourselves to consider though it would really always be that way it was with that thought that someone else to consider that would put us in the most danger that would drive us to our end we were lying together when the agreement was made in the pitch dark of my bedroom and it was the kind of close suffocating darkness that makes you panic makes your eyes wide searching out any light with him though it was easy and relaxing he was calming to me it was with my lips pressed against his mouth that i agreed to tell his fellow marauders there i was then the next night creeping into bridget bedroom while james slept in my own seeking out sirius i felt the sooner it was over with the better sirius seemed an easy start because i d already said james had proposed the first time and maybe maybe he d be happy excited supportive i was not sure why it had to be done then and now but it did sirius my whisper grew louder and more persistent through the dark and i lit my wand shining it not directly over the bed but just enough so i could make out his body and limbs tangled in with bridget wake up i nudged him with my foot and then prodded him with my wand and finally he gave a snort and flopped over onto his side and blinked up at me blimey lily up for a little m nage trois action then didnttake you for the type good to know the two of you have a well established stable relationship and all i rolled my eyes well established and stable in certain ways it is he sounded smug even through the semi dark and he was nude not just you know from the waist up strategically covered and all of that but just nude leg dangling off the side of the bed hair a mess but really who could blame a girl for looking i need to talk to you he made no offer to sit up or cover or move in anyway just grunted a non committal response it james he well okay he proposed like really this time down on one knee and a ring and all of that i just thought he thought you should know first the silence that followed was long and heavy and let admit awkward his naked form was distorted to me shadows playing over his body and the bright light of my wand only falling on to his face and bridget bare back beside him i shifted my weight from one foot to the other and chewed my lip and looked around the room finally he spoke alright then love let see the rock he propped himself up on his elbow adjusted his legs to offer a bit of modesty to the situation and grasped my hand with his warm one i shone my wand down onto it and the sparkly little gold thing glinted prettily when he looked up it was with a genuine smile and i felt better i felt assured about it all that was assuming mrs potter or remus for that matter didntblast me to hell when they found out funny to think we re only eighteen sirius muttered i saw that night perhaps for the time ever just why he and james were best friends pseudo brothers they made sense together they offered a bit of themselves to the other sirius was brash and offensive but i could not say he was a bad friend he was a good man he was relief in times of trouble that night i went back to james and i pressed myself close to him and i breathed in everything about him and i looked into his eyes and somehow this was the beginning this was the beginning of us the beginning of a future a happiness not so far behind that beginning though was a looming end and it funny how love can make you blind to all of that the sky lit up that night and people died and war waged on but we were just young and quiet and happy for that night at least abc the ends not near it here by band of horses abc hello i sorry for the delay in this chapter it took a long time and it not that long or good enough to make up for the delay but i just wanted to get something up before summer ended and school started again i stand by this chapter though it may not be as entire or detailed as i would ve liked to have made it but i think i got the point out they re happy they re engaged young in love but they re doomed as much as i and lily and james try to move beyond the war and voldemort and all of that i just can not i cantwrite a chapter now without obviously knowing that they re going to die and whatever happiness they re experiencing is just so doomed and my inability to move beyond that shows through lily but i hope you read and enjoy and review if you d like there are times i d like to quit this story i kind of into writing the o c fanfic now but i want to finish this one and do it justice so there you are chapter 35 hiding my heart abc acid tongue by jenny lewis abc happiness was not somewhere he and i dwelled for too long or rather not somewhere i dwelled for long and now that we were in this thing forever he sort of followed wherever i went even if it was into some strange mood that didntlift for weeks on end i did not feel particularly guilty or bad about bringing him down with me just simply appreciated his company i figured this was how a relationship worked give and take and well right then i was taking more than i could possibly make up for later it wasntthat i was unhappy i was more restless uncomfortably at a loss with myself i had lost myself that was it i had somewhere between graduation and our engagement lost myself i hadnteven a chance to find myself after graduation before i had lost myself because then it wasntjust myself it was us and it became hard to distinguish where i ended and he began i figured i should appreciate how close we were how he seemed to read my mind some days but mostly i was disappointed that i had failed so miserably at establishing my own life failed so miserably had detaching a bit and stepping back and finding out who i was so i had lost myself there wasntreally anything to be upset over it wasntas if i woke in the morning and forgot who i was it was more i woke in the morning and felt so remarkably unchanged so remarkably indifferent to life i was ashamed that my mindset was so bleak that i couldntget away from it couldntturn things around but i hadntwanted to turn things around once i got into my comfortable little corner of the universe no use bothering things when i had a nice cozy little unimportant existence going on i had been optimistic for awhile it faded like things fade i had lost myself the way we lose ourselves at different points in our lives you get to a certain age and suddenly there no santa claus christmas comes calling and you could hardly care less it just gets stressful when the magic is gone or you turn twelve or thirteen and then your birthdays grow lesser and lesser in importance you try to muster up some excitement as the years pass but eventually you realize what happening years passing what is there to be excited about so you lose that magic that excitement too snow falls for the first time that winter but you turn a blind eye the sun comes out for the first time in weeks and it suddenly summertime and what it to you it ll be over before you realize it had come and then the leaves will change and you dontcare about that either things grow insignificant you meet a crossroads you re leaving childhood you re an adult and childish things no longer appeal to you but you wish they did you wish so much you could regain some spark some life some feeling at these milestones at these times you spend your year trying and i was at that point i was at that trying to feel happy point i didntknow what was beyond that point i didntknow if a different kind of happiness sunk in when those magical nearly trivial happiness of your past fade i didntknow if it would come full circle if those feelings yes would fade but you d capture different ones you d see joy in different places or perhaps in the very same places just with a different eye i hoped so very much to wake up some morning realize my heart was still beating and just be happy with that it was tiresome to be endlessly expecting some renewed flutter some flurry of excitement of adventure within yourself that never came james became the exception when before even though i loved him we kept a modest distance a bit of a cap on our emotions now i just saw him and lit up sometimes there were a couple of days or even a week when i wouldntsee him he was more involved in the order than i could find the energy to be he came calling after those long days those secretive journeys and i could not think of how i ever survived without him where i had lost myself i was finding him never did he seem more beautiful so absolutely appealing to me where i felt no emotion no fire toward some things i felt more toward him sometimes i simply looked at him and lost myself to inexplicable tears inexplicable emotion he had no idea what to think he seemed bemused most of the time but sometimes his face those hazel eyes would crease up in worry and he never asked what was wrong just burned me with his stare things i worried about before were so insanely pointless that i felt sick and angry with myself remus was not my concern sirius was not my concern his damned mum and her damned opinions of me i shouldn t ve ever cared as much as i had i d wasted time i hadntbeen seeing him as clearly as i was now it was startling to see him as honourable as worthy and good as i did now it was my greatest comfort to see his familiar face i had started living more for him than for me and it scared me it confused me but i didntknow how to better it i didntknow how to simply find myself i d had passion before i thought and it was gone buried deep within doubt and fear of change and even my hair was a bit tamer a bit less fiery i often wondered if because that passion that drive was gone from me if he too would be gone i did not want him to fall out of love with me for me to bore him so much that he went off to bigger and better things because compared with my normally listless state there had to be bigger and better things he pretended not to notice for which i loved him when he suggested dinner and i turned him down he simply ate himself and brought me some wine when he would kiss me with less than honourable intentions in mind and he saw no response no desire in my eyes he would kiss me few more times more demurely and then he would turn and go to sleep winding his arm around me at some point in the night after a long order meeting some of them would like to go to a pub and order a round and i never felt like leaving my warm little flat so he d go himself or else turn his buddies down with a grin and an arm about my waist his patience with me was nearly aggravating but mostly overwhelming to know he loved me and simply trusted me and my judgment now i couldntunderstand how we grew closer how our love grew stronger as i grew in some ways weaker i assumed it was him supporting me somehow but i just honestly loved him and i couldntcare if i spoke to another living soul for the rest of my life suddenly so suddenly that it nearly panicked me he was the most important thing to me more important than me nothing penetrated that nothing or no one bothered me anymore i floated on kind of complacently at least in my own mind and unaware of anything else it was a sort of reckless way to live i pondered but i was unperturbed and just read a lot of books abc i come bearing food he announced himself as he apparated into the flat and i could hear the grin on his face he was often hopeful when he came home i suspected he was always waiting for my mood to change oh i just had some i waved my hand in the direction of the mess of chocolate bar wrappers and a wine glass on the coffee table dinner lily lily i not buying that you need some real food besides it our month anniversary i arched an eyebrow of our engagement i mean you didntwant to celebrate your birthday last week and fine i was accepting of that then but we re celebrating tonight whether you like it or not his tone wasntas authoritative as i knew he meant for it to be he was more worried than anything james really i a little drunk and when this wears off i ll just be plain tired so another time okay he set the paper bag of food down onto the coffee table and made my mess disappear with a flick of his wand it not our month anniversary another time that the point of celebrating the day of i figured this could compensate for your birthday a little sirius and bridget can come if you d like or they can stay away it in my hands just let me know how you re feeling i sighed and looked up from the magazine i was leafing through i feel like i want to be left alone so eat your dinner i ll read we ll both be in peace he listened tearing into the bag of what turned out to be chinese food and gulped some down in the kind of quiet we hadntshared in awhile it was a tense quiet his patience of an angel were finally wearing thin i realized i didntcare though maybe a fight would wake me up a little both literally from my drunk and figuratively from well my head this is what you do now then is this what you re going to do for the rest of our lives sit around while i gone and get drunk alone read some stupid witches gossip rag want to be left alone is this actually who you are now i didntresponded just merely continued reading looking bored i was bored bored with everything he was starting to feel responsible or something perhaps it wasnthis fault though he was the one thing keeping me going i didntfeel like flattering him or bothering to share that i just wanted peace i figured some external peace and quiet may eventually at some point perhaps offer me some internal peace and quiet it was a long shot since it d been weeks of peace and quiet and i still found my thoughts strange erratic dark disinterested i d even driven sirius off he was perpetually interested in bothering me pestering me while the two of us were both at the flat alone both bridget and james working something neither of us did aside from the order after i fell ill in october i d never returned to st mungo s it was foolish because it was really after that when i d gotten so entirely lifeless but it had become mechanic to me and i didntreally care as much as a hospital worker should ve gaping wounds and strange rashes spilling blood none of it affected me as it had i felt so detached from the entire world all but him my heart still beat for him even if i went from incredibly affectionate to bored by him he was just the only one who would put up with it but yes sirius even he stayed away from me i must ve seemed really disturbed really altered for him to avoid me avoid that what people were doing or i was paranoid no one probably noticed my lifelessness as much as i seemed to i still smiled sometimes and especially when i drank too much i wasntunfriendly when people tried to be friendly i just didntfeel any connection when i would speak when i would offer smiles and laughs sometimes i d crawl out of my cocoon and james and i would spend the night together and for the first time in weeks i would truly have had felt alive with my legs wound around him and his eyes bright as he brushed his hands all over my face and through my hair i felt connected to no one but him in those long moments he finished his food bade me goodnight and went to bed it occurred to me then that i did not know when he had officially moved in it could not have been good to be so utterly unaware of things like that i hadnteven wanted him to move in i loved my flat yes but bridget and sirius had as much of a stamp on it now as we did and damn it james was bloody wealthy why were we in a flat to begin with he could buy us a house i decided and it would be lovely but that wasntwhat i really wanted either of course as usual i hadntan idea what i really wanted and then it hit me very hard and emotion came flooding back through my wine induced drunk i was exhausted with myself i could not bear to consider who i d become and yet i expected james to tirelessly put up with it i expected him to look forward to coming home to me when my moods toward him ranged from madly in love to utter and complete disinterest when one second he was my life line and the next i wanted to be left alone i was not making sense i could not bring him down any longer abc i crawled into bed beside him and he lay awake his clothing and glasses still on he hadntcome to bed due to need of sleep rather because of weariness over me i was so ashamed with my behaviour i sorry i finally said and my voice cracked and he turned to me he really was a perfect picture his cheeks were rosy with caged anger and his chest rose and fell steadily his hazel eyes burned into my own and his long lashes fluttered as he sighed his hair stood up at odd directions and it was not irritating just so entirely endearing he had lines about his eyes now and they gave him character were the beginning of a story i could imagine loving him in forty fifty sixty years just as i did now i could love him in age just as i did in youth i love you i promised my mum happy for us you know lily you never even asked if i d told her she invited us over for a meal but but i told her i d let her know once you got out of this unsettling place you re in you re so bloody detached it unnerving to look at you sometimes your eyes his thumb brushed my cheek and i felt my breath catch and my heart hum they re so off sometimes not even your colour just green not bright green you ve lost yourself a bit hmm he coaxed and i wanted to talk to finally explain all he d been putting up with but it didntcome to me i old now i feel i nineteen it feels so old twenty twenty that ll be the end of me imagine what you ll have to put up with next year i murmured embarrassed this is all about you turning nineteen his brow furrowed and concentration suited him i loved to see his face line with thought that was just a few days ago though i laid a hand against his chest and felt his heart drum just for my own amusement no it not about that at all i cantexplain what it about though james my eyes stung with tears and my emotions were unreadable these days it just as you said i ve lost myself somewhere in all that been going on i so scared for us some days so unconcerned others there a war happening and i just sit here reading magazines and getting drunk by myself i so i so he kissed me very softly and i sighed into it pressing myself close against the length of his body and it was november and cold and he was so very warm that i felt burned at the contact of his skin i loved it i would not trade the feeling of him for anything in the entire world we ll get you back he spoke against my lips teeth against the bottom one for a moment rebirth you in a way you needntworry i wontlet you just slip away you know his hand slid down my cheek and neck curved over my breast and finally pressed hard into my side gripping my hip and pulling me as close as possible my head against his chest leg going between his and the other one over i could hardly breathe for how i felt he had become a man recently with all of the fighting and leaving and warring but to know he was man in this relationship now too to know that we were for real that this was happening and he was there and real and constant and stable it made me feel a bit more like all of those things too my lethargy even after we d had sex and he d fell into sleep for a few minutes finally passed i lay there absolutely taken once again with just his face just his skin and his scruff and his breathing and i felt better then as if i could get out of bed when the sun came up and realize myself again i hoped oh i hoped so greatly for it he amazed me and i knew all through school he and sirius had spent time amazing other girls but he was amazing me now as the man he d grown to be and my heart was entirely his i told him so when he stirred a half hour later we ll get a house too get out of here and let get married lily soon before christmas before anything changes i knew he meant by way of the world the war the danger his voice was a husky whisper and his nose was pressed into my cheek as he spoke against my skin we couldntbe close enough now i felt better than i had in a long time i felt anything something which i hadntin a long time it was funny to think it was so much to do with him funny and well life altering abc lost by coldplay abc hi i realize this chapter seems to have come out of left field truthfully i just wrote it right now usually i like to let them sit a little while and read over them but i feel pretty powerfully about this one i was recently inspired and was fearful i would lose it so i wrote the way lily was feeling is so close to how i know i can feel perhaps not as exaggerated and i thought it was important for her to have that for her feelings to be so raw and jumbled that she lost herself for a short time i could ve dragged it on and i felt like it but i get tired of negative lily she evolving our lily and james might be a bit off character maybe in this chapter compared to how i usually write him but this has been going on for a long time and i finally see where this should be going where i hope i can take it so i just writing what comes to me i admit there not a lot in this chapter aside from lily thoughts and their growing love but i feel it a necessary chapter a bit more than a transition chapter it an incredibly profound one for lily i realize it lacking by way of magic and other characters haha but they need to have their moments so i hope you like it or at least appreciate the unexpected update life gets busy and i not too fond of what it busy with school so i wanted to write it funny to think second year university has come on so quickly but ok goodnight and enjoy as you know feedback is appreciated but not what prompts me to write more i wontdemand reviews in exchange for another chapter an ending if one person still reads i will still finish take care p s jenny lewis new album is fantastic and acid tongue is a great song but they re all great i suggest you check it our carpet baggers jack killed mom black sand fernando all winners that i cantstop listening to as is the rest of the album i feel passionately about jenny lewis music both solo and with rilo kiley so i thought i d take the chance to plug it i know how happy it makes me feel coldplay new stuff is great too ok i take my leave chapter 37 open invitation abc the matter of our discussion by boom bip abc lily i found scrawled on the back of an old prophet i had to leave and tell sirius please it is not because of some silly broken heart he and i were both well aware of the situation we were in and i just realized when he said i dontlove you and i seeing someone else well i realized i was tired of sitting still i ve been sitting still for too long my life had become stagnant just waiting waiting for me to wake up and i ve woken lily the lease is up in a couple of weeks you can renew it of course but i certain that husband of your may have something better lined up absolute godspeed to you and if we make it through this i hope to see you again bridget bridget had left and her things were gone all the morning after regulus had died or the morning after sirius had found out regulus had died being involved with the death eaters well his death and the circumstances surrounding it were shrouded in mystery all that was known for certain was that voldemort or one of the followers had made known to the black family that their youngest son was dead at the hands of the dark lord this was some sort of breakthrough for the order of the phoenix and some strange tragedy for sirius he was estranged from his family the evil members of it at least and his brother included but when he came home that night and told me in the dark that regulus was dead there was heartbreak in his voice his eyes so we were going to move we as in me and james but it felt like the three of us because sirius never left sirius never left and he drank and smoked and had some quiet ache inside of him that he rarely spoke of i spent my days with him packing and smoking and drinking alongside him not the best of influences i could easily admit james involvement with the order intensified so that he hardly was home but to sleep yet somehow apparently he had a place lined up for us and i had no expectations it crazy you re packing everything up to let him move you to god only knows where sirius would sit and watch television and observe he probably moving you to a smaller place you know bloody hell what if he moving you in with his mum or me the three of us in old uncle alphard s i waved my wand and reminisced over some photographs tried on old clothes typical things that are done when packing could you turn that down i d never met a wizard so devoted to the television sure sure a pause and the volume stayed large just tell me who this is i joined him in the living room where his feet were propped up on the coffee table bottle of beer resting against his side and cigar smoking from between his fingers he did not look up eyes fixed on the screen i watched the program for a minute took note of who had grabbed his attention and then chuckled farrah fawcett an episode of charlie angels was playing and we rarely received american programming but the show with three beautiful women had caught on worldwide farrah he repeated slightly in awe and dragging from the cigar she the most beautiful woman i ve ever laid eyes on her hair i finished packing in silence and looked around the barren flat with unease in my stomach while he sat and quietly watched the crime fighting trio blonde voluminous haired farrah his instant favourite with a beer in hand and my feet propped up on one of the many boxes that crowded the living room i watched with him and could understand the attraction james would laugh and say he liked that about me i was not often jealous over another woman looks just appreciative you know someday we re going to be forty and we ll look back on this and it ll all look so easy it going to be easy someday lil we might even miss it the excitement seems like we should be enjoying our youth you think we did not talk of bridget and i could not think of anything else when i looked at him but his dead brother how did someone just go through their day with the thoughts of dead siblings in their mind how did they not just break down and feel as if a piece of them was missing too i could not say i liked petunia i could not say i even loved her very often but she was my blood and we were bonded for life whether we liked it or not and if she died if she or that horrible vernon of hers died my heart would break jealous evil bitter girl that she was my heart would break i wondered how sirius heart was still full i felt it for him whether it made sense or not when i looked at him and thought of him and his situation his life my eyes welled and my breathing choked and my chest ached actually ached for him sirius it had been but days and it felt like weeks since bridget left since james decided we were moving since regulus death was made known and he could still take the opportunity to lose his mind i decided how are you farrah bright smile and bouncing hair flashed on screen and sirius face did not light up as it had earlier he did not respond god sirius it would make all the sense in the world if you were just broken you know i feeling it for you i cant imagine your mind right now the girls laughed sirius jaw clenched he clicked the set off and as he spoke his hand came up to clutch his chest just over his heart and his voice was low nearly dangerous i have lost people i spent a lot of time with bridget even if there is someone else she was so wonderful remus he comes and goes and fails and flails and none of us know what he thinking about it all regulus regulus was not a good person or brother but when i heard when they told me i just i just remembered him as my toddler brother scared of the dark or asking questions when i got magic first i remembered our mutual and brief admiration for one another he was innocent and smart and well loved he looked up to me because i was the oldest you know i lost my little brother years ago lily but to know his heart stopped beating to know he lost himself to that world i choked out a sob and neither of us spoke again until james returned home news of plots and plans and deals when we left that flat forever i gave sirius a departing gift rather backwards as i thought of house warming gifts and wasntthat the world i should be living in nice parties with nice people and nice gifts and nice marriages and beautiful babies i gave him the poster of farrah fawcett in a red swimsuit with her head full of bouncy curls thrown back and a wide toothy smile across her face her leg was bent up and her skin was tanned and she was some sort of all american girl but she was beautiful and he loved it and hugged me tightly and breathed my hair there was something in moving and feeling and breathing that made me feel like we were going to be okay but also doomed such misplaced faith i thought as i cradled his head and james looked on with some fierce protection in his eyes and folded arms the flat was empty sirius heart was empty and there was something to be said for fresh starts and bright futures but i did not feel as if moving and leaving and trying was really going to bring us either of those hopeful hopeful things i would keep an open mind though abc remus lupin somehow still my nemesis as he slowly became everyone else s too returned home from a mission wounded and bruised and days away from the full moon his elbow was broken and they were worried not even magic could heal it before he transformed and ruined it worse remus lupin was at an odds of sorts he was the bad guy in our situation and only bad because they needed someone to be bad he was a werewolf so he got sent to strange dark places with strange dark people and no one really knew if he was ever going to come back from them remus was trapped in his dangerous little pattern because there were few other options for him or any of us and none of us had a calling anymore we were all just in it to win or live we were at the order headquarters when he came calling back and he smelled of singed clothes and skin sporting burns on his knuckles that sent me into medi witch mode making me wonder if things were different would i have had stuck it out at st mungo s i couldntthink of what normal path my life was supposed to have had taken i could not think of a life without looming danger anymore and it worried me that i may never get back on track i healed his burns and dabbed his cuts with strong smelling healing liquid and we were quiet alone in the room as the others discussed the information he d found out james would tell me later he was a good husband like that how it been remus asked and to be in the midst of the meeting yet not apart of it was peculiar the interactions of the order members was not really something i picked up on before who was involved who was passive who was pissed off and just wanted it over sirius took the role of boisterous pissed off member this eve and he would slam his hand on the table and say that it was not enough never enough information we didntknow enough and the other side always knew more always knew too much knew our moves before we knew them sirius was pissed off and wanted it over and i felt old as i watched him quiet he been quiet til tonight actually watched television sat on his arse and watched me pack without helping if nothing else i expected to find out who his new woman is remus swallowed and i was working on bandaging and healing what i could he needed a trip to st mungo to be certain but subduing the pain was the mission for the moment he angry with me for not being here he thinks i should be here more to to watch out for him i dontknow tell him his dead brother is no big deal and fucking around on bridget is perfectly acceptable for the times remus shook his head and looked as old as i felt you look horrible remus cantyou just see him getting himself killed he getting to that point not suicidal sorry i dontmean that but he getting to that out of control point he too impatient for this sort of sit and wait trial and error life and death thing arm in a sling and eye bruised remus involved himself in the argument occurring around the table as i tidied up and worried about more men than just my own husband abc it so funny to me that we spend our entire lives our entire childhood at least being taught that our family is important blood is important and bonds us for life and no one will care about us more than our brothers and sisters mothers and fathers that the kind of love that is irreplaceable we re to think but everything i ve learned after that is the very opposite maybe it just the times but i ve never witnessed so many disposable familial relationships in my life my own included dammit james held my hand tightly as we walked more dragging me along behind him than anything i ve spent every day i can remember since i turned ten i swear just dreaming of escaping but escaping what and escaping to where because even when i got hogwarts my escape i still dreamt of escaping it makes me worry i want to escape the very person i am the very life i lead i feel so totally alarmed when i catch up to my thoughts and they re all regarding how nice it would be to start over some place far far away i dontknow where my subconscious is leading me to but it as if i damned until i ve found it i cantbreathe easy cantget over the lackluster family ties i have until i know there a brand new future out there for me somewhere i gasped and he sighed and then grinned and took his hand away and stepped forward gesturing in front of him though there was no need to very suddenly we were home my unfinished rant hung between us tense for a moment until i too smiled and looked through the dark to see where he had brought me it was nearly funny how clear things became that night there was a wholeness in my heart as i considered what he had done for us and thoughts of being some passive uninvolved wife diminished i realized he d found this place because he had wanted to because he saw what had been happening to me how many pieces i was about to be in and he was my husband and he had sought out a home to make us real to bring me back through all that was incomplete that night through all that was broken and fractured and falling and fading and impossible i felt entirely complete and at ease and it was foolish naive but it was such a warm feeling that cold night what do you think he asked his voice quiet and husky in the lingering winter air the collar of his pea coat stood up around his neck and his hands were shoved deep in his pockets his hair wind strewn and nose red he looked like a husband then or maybe i was just looking at him as my husband for the first time since the wedding everything was so fast only flashes of the months really remained in my mind the rings on my finger were cold against my skin and i looked down at them to assure they were really there i think it beautiful i think it everything anyone would want but never think to look for we went inside all of my things were there of course he was a magical magical man and that night i learned about godric hollow and i learned a little more of all of the evil going on around us godric hollow was a muggle village near cornwall though with a generous wizard history as well it was a small but lively village private but friendly the home he had found us was a cozy one roomier than what you d expect but with all of the warmth a cottage in such a village should offer there was a fireplace in the living room and a veranda on the front flower boxes on the windows cobblestone path and a large back yard goosebumps rose along my arms when i could very clearly save for blurriness around the edges see a future here with him and even maybe some crazy day a family he had not done any decorating for which i was thankful and felt a bit more apart of the process than i had i apologized i kissed him i thanked him for watching out for me for not leaving me behind for being aware of my imminent suffocation from our world of problems but never interfering to the point of having my feel inadequate we can build this up together furniture and photographs and everything food beer he chuckled and i thought he looked absolutely dashing in his grey knit sweater and his dark jeans boots kicked off and glasses unfogging what an idea starting our life together why didntwe think of it sooner good timing we ve got people to take care of now sirius is going to come back around better than ever lily and remus he d never betray us doubt barely there on the tip of his tongue we had a bed and we had a curtain in the bedroom and we slept soundly that first night and i hadnteven seen the place in the daylight but it felt like home even in the cloak of dark i could ve cried i would ve cried i waited to cry until he was fast asleep because i felt stable and i felt safe and felt so securely in love with him but sometimes there was nothing like stability and safety and security to shake you up sometimes there was nothing like hope and happiness and oh prayers to shake you to the very core because there it all was and there it all could go when he held me that night i took note of it i was aware of how i instinctively took the left side and turned away from him curling up and making myself comfortable and then he d find his place that night it was him pressed to my back one hand curled over my stomach and up under my top and the other rubbing small circles on my scalp until he drifted off it was warm not too warm because of the cold night and i wondered how this was comfortable how this was nice to be so close to someone so void of any personal space it was funny to me that this was how people were this was how they slept i could not remember compromising my sleeping positions for this shared one and i decided it was just something that came with attraction love a bond i felt more alive that night than i d ever in the last year i was well aware of all coming down on us well aware of the trouble we could get into and the trouble already plaguing our world it was that clarity that comprehension that had me breathing easier there was no time to worry about lost families my own or someone else s and there was no time to regret and doubt and complain everyone should live their lives i thought as if they re not going to get another chance for anything what the matter he awoke and we had no clock but the sky was brightening and i wanted to sleep before dawn was truly on the horizon he heard my crying felt it rather than saw it his fingers wet themselves on my cheeks nothing this is so right i just am so happy but so worried so aware i sorry mmm he murmured and he nuzzled his face into the back of my neck and the feeling was instant comfort you think too much i love you there was really no need for anything else abc open invitation by black rebel motorcycle club hidden track after the line abc if you are reading thank you for reading i hope summer is well for all chapter 38 take me in abc i dreamt the entire first week we lived in godric hollow i d never been a dreamer not a dreamer in the unconcious state of mind sort of way at least but the dreams were vivid unreachable things i had been a dreamer in regards to the future and success and hopes i could see what i wanted as the years would pass and i could see what i should look like and feel like but i was awake when i dreamt of my future never dreamt when i was asleep until that first week when my dreams were so startling that i would wake up more exhausted than before i slept and i could remember my dreams in detail which i didntthink was common my dreams spanned different things i dreamt of death and terror and destruction and horrible horrible things that wet my eyes and made my heart pound i saw people i loved lifeless and cold and bloody and broken i saw the end of our world and i could not see myself so i assumed i was gone too i saw bad things that broke my heart and dreams were not meant to be that way they were what you called nightmares i assumed the nightmares were long mean painful things but the dreams in between were quick bursts of hope and sunshine and love i dreamt of having a tan and i smiled remembering it i dreamt that we were on some west sunshine coast where things were warm and there were no dementors to change the weather to some foggy rainy mess i dreamt of the sun and it was warm and we were happy and james was by my side and i felt whole and swollen and well i dreamt of sirius happy and calm and sober and in love i dreamt of his handsome face smiling again and fuller than his recent weight loss had changed no more hollow sunken cheeks or dark eyes i dreamt of those eyes alight again and not so distant dull faded i dreamt of being pregnant i saw myself rounded my cheeks protruding further when i smiled my stomach some perfect ball shape my hair was longer and frizzy and there was a dewy glow that i didntrecognize my breasts had grown to an unnatural size and i saw myself with not much further to go i could hardly walk but i looked happier than i could ever remember being in my entire life i was nineteen years old and these were not things i expected to dream of abc the cold stung my eyes as we trudged over the frosty ground through the hard snow my nose ran and i wiped at it with my mittens tugging my hat low over my ears but i thought the worst sound in the world was crunching snow through covered ears i performed a charm on my boots to keep them quiet and the group nodded and followed suit they thought i was clever i was just trying to keep the ache in my head at bay i did not even think of being silent to ward off enemies because we were surrounded by them we d been compromised and by that i mean we were in danger a couple of ours had been taken out and a retaliation was planned but only through the auror of the order and only with information that had been extracted from the ministry the rest of us were off to keep safe we were off for safe keeping and it would not be long now before safe keeping meant keeping secrets and keeping secrets meant secret keeping the moon was high and the sky was clear and it was late at night or early in the morning i wasntsure because in the wintertime everything looks the same most of the time and no lily use your common sense it must be near midnight or just after if the moon that high 5 am would be a lower moon but no sunrise i forgot about sunrises lately because we hardly saw daylight and on we trudged through the cold biting air there was no wind or movement or breath just that air that hurt your lungs to breathe it was so cold so of course we were out in the elements and my legs began to shake after awhile and warming charms wore off and were redone and i was in the middle of the group and james was behind me somewhere murmuring softly with sirius remus and peter and we had mad eye with us until he was called on from the other half of the group it had to be somewhat professional we were told the ministry had to put on somewhat of a show take care of what we were trying to take care of we had to work together and the minute we started too our men were ambushed on a mission and we lost and they gained and they would fix it the ministry promised so off went the most powerful title wise members of the order to try to police the death eaters and it was almost laughable to consider arresting those people because they were unknown but for lord voldemort and there was no proof on those we did know half of sirius family for example and you could not just ambush them back and arrest them all when they murdered with a swish of the wand and disappeared just as quickly things were looking down the only sound were the murmurs of the group easily mistaken for some animal or breeze or swaying tree i felt as if i were nine years old with cold ears and nose and frozen cheeks and wide eyes bright from cold prodded tears i felt so much apart of something bigger than myself or any of us and i wondered if it would make a difference if we d survive this soon enough to see our efforts pay off i was becoming more aware of this separtist muggle hating world we were living in being terrorized by a demented wizard with far too much power for even the best dumbledore to contend with the ministry was at odds people were falling apart at the seams and we were trying and hoping and praying to stop the spread to confine it before the deadliness was all consuming there was something about a bone chilling february night that makes you feel alive your blood is pumping and your extremeties are numb and your mind is whirring and every heavy thought you ve had are there and every dream and yearning you ve had seem possible and there is nothing but present and future past is unimportant and we were moving forward wands mad eye breathed and we all stopped in our tracks and held our breaths and i wondered when our nerves would catch up to us when this would all be too much when mad eye would drop of a heart attack when dumbledore would disappear and never come back when sirius would just turn and lose his mind and maybe remus would finally join the dark side and peter pettigrew would soon surrender i wondered how long this could last for how much longer we would be young before we were old with grief and worry and loss we moved again when it turned out to be nothing of concern and sirius made some sound that suggested he wished more than anything that it would be something because he wanted to take someone out he wanted to finish someone off his own cousin perhaps and it made me nervous to watch the change come about in him murder was such an easy thing on both sides now frank and alice longbottom had gathered together after the group arrived and were whispering to one another hurriedly and importantly and he brushed her hair back from her raw face and her eyes were shining to watch that sort of love on display scared me and there was a moment when marlene mckinnon had lit her wand and there was a brief second of light aside from that of the moon when i looked back and saw the four of them behind me surveying the place we would set up camp and james hazel eyes glinted in the light and they were different than i was used to and my arms goosebumped despite the fresh warming charm and it was for a rush of a thousand emotions evoked by the look in his eyes i felt collapsable as if any second this would be it and i would just take him and run off and there was nothing more i wanted then no other person i cared for but him he was all i wanted and i know he felt inadequate he felt as if he was doing a bad job of taking care of me and protecting me but i did not want for that did not need to be shielded i just needed honesty and bravery and him and i felt an indescribable warm well inside of me and my breathing quickened and i felt like running for all of the potential we had and all that we could lose i sought him out blindly as darkness returned and protecting charms were cast all around the wooded area and only colourful sparks and streams lit my way as i fumbled and stumbled through the people and snow to his knowingly awaiting arms oh if only things were as simple as rushing to him and being held by him and running away with him if only it were some movie when we made the decision to love one another forever that then we could runaway with me riding shotgun while he wore sunglasses and we were in some car with the top down and the sun shining but it was a february night with breath hanging still and trees frosty with cold snow crunching and twigs snapping and people breathing and mumbling and smoking and wishing and hoping and giving up and crying and fighting i breathed in the smell of sweat and outdoors and cold and liquor on him for a few moments and his arms were long wrapped around my back and firmly holding the back of my head against his chest one hand against the small of my back and he made me feel feminine and lovely and needed and wanted and rested and well even despite the mammoth coat and boots and mits and scarf and hat i wore he was warm and strong and there and good but there was something different something off something darker in being so close to him something nearly scary and the transformation of these boys james and sirius to these frowning protective men was a product of the war it was war against all odds and i dreamt of leaving it all behind that night abc i and love and you by the avett brothers abc i awoke late in the night early in the morning and the fire had died down and there was a flutter and flurry of snow as the door opened to the small camp someone had just switched patrols and i could hear them stomping their feet and blowing on their hands there was still no movement in the air an eerily quiet breathless night it was as if the entire world was holding it breath with us waiting on word and news and change wrapping my coat around me i got up from the cot i shared with marlene rather than james it seemed more like a camping fun sleepover than an escape from attacks that way sirius remus and two other members were changing places just precautionary considering the protection we d taken around the small camp sirius had a smoke in his mouth and remus was holding a flask in his gloved hand i went to the camp stove and brewed a quick tea prodding the leaves with my wand to get some taste from them i offered a cup to the two marauders and they accepted remus dumping the dark liquor into his and then sirius and offering me the remnants i finished it with a swig we gathered in the small room off of where everyone else slept not separated by a door due to the cramped space it was the best that could be done outside of a tent and everyone had rejected that idea considering the frigid temperature and constant need to replenish warming charms february air burns as much as this stuff sirius murmured and his face was red with cold as he swilled his tea remus nodded his agreement and then sighed to me how are you doing lily not necessarily a question but an acknowledgement of my presence there fine i held my arms tight around myself sirius finished his cigarette and flicked the butt out is everyone either drinking or smoking by now i asked and remus chuckled and somehow under the influence of liquor and caffeine and cold he was friendlier looked warmer despite his cold bitten skin one way or the other to get through hmm i mused poured my own tea and held it in both my hands to warm them it was hard to believe that this was where we were that it had all come down to this i wanted to talk to sirius to touch base because since we moved i hadntseen him nor had he seen our house our home but the relationships i had established with each of them sirius some damaged destructive mess of companionship and love and support in times of need and remus a more critical hostile one with friendliness at unexpected moments of endearment made it strange to try to carry on a conversation that encompassed issues i wished to address with each of them so instead we just talked about the weather and godric hollow and sirius cussed regulus black name a few times he bade goodnight before remus kissing me on the cheek and smelling like liquor and smoke and frost so remus kicked his boots off and sat down rubbing his feet sirius is sleeping with marlene hmm oh no i bunking with her because james said he d be up and down all night on watch and stuff remus scoffed sirius is fucking marlene m dear oh oh really wasntquite expecting that one so she was who he was with the cheating thing that ended him and bridget remus nodded and i felt out of the loop but it more than what he had with bridget he told me and i missed her long dark hair in braids and her sparkling eyes smile laugh i missed her before she became bitter like sirius they were too good of a match in the end she thought of ray far too often to have moved on so quickly and so they just stewed together just resented the very path that had brought them here not to insult her at all but they both knew what it was with marlene he quiet about it you know not very like sirius i d say he loved her if i knew better blimey i wondered if he would change to the glowing handsome vision i d dreamt of love oh love i couldntimagine what it would do for sirius to love and be loved back i couldntimagine what it would do for remus either both of them all of us were so aimless so without direction good for him i think love would look good on him i tired of this i not certain i understand it i dontknow when i supposed to start actually living as opposed to fighting and trying when do we start careers and families do we have to wait out the war and hope something comes together afterwards i figured this would last a little while and then we d start our real lives but world as we know it is gone this is our real lives now ah maybe james could ve been an auror or you a medi witch or sirius just some whackjob out to make a lot of money i thought i d travel around meet a thousand beautiful women and have stories to tell not stories about cold blooded murder and a sort of prejudice that destroying our world remus eyes pierced me and i bit my lip and my face fell and he was right these were our lives this war was where we lived what re we going to do i whispered and there was surge in my veins a desire stronger than ever to end this before we all lost everything before we did not even have this life this war torn world before we had nothing and were ghosts of our former selves remus offered out another flask and we drunk to our salvation it ll all work out eventually cheers he said and there was a smile on his lips that was more of a grimace than i d ever seen i went back to bed and crawled in with james this time and kissed him in the dark until it was hard to stop and we were sure going at this blind abc it ll all work out by tom petty abc hello 2010 there not a lot to say about it just that it happened so quickly 2009 is a blur i hope you all had great holidays and breaks and whatever else you re doing at this time of year happy new year which is such a strange thing that it here so soon i wish when a new year came it was actually a new beginning instead of a return to school and the same old same old maybe some day this education thing will be done ha this chapter came together quickly and i sorry for the time between chapters now this little story has been chugging along for five years that blows my mind i dontremember who i was five years ago no that not true i was sixteen i remember sixteen which makes me realize how very old i am now my friends and i just sort of sit around remarking about how old we are and how fast things have gone by and how it doesntseem real anymore it like playing catch up in our own lives it a funny thing turning twenty and then twenty one time just does really strange things to you this chapter is just you know a darker exploration of the times it kind of a rip off from the deathly hallows considering the trios camping adventure looking for horcruxes but i needed some way to make the whole thing seem real to lily as for facts about the war at that time i just kind of went with it and made it up haha so hopefully it makes sense i wanted this chapter to be a kind of dount about her and james but it didntquite turn out that way i dontreally mind it worked out lily approaching more mature era i think reflecting on my moody insightful lily is annoying because even when she is energetic and youthful she thinks about it too much which is kind of the point of the story so i guess you have to love it or leave it i not sure when this thing will come to an end when i tired of writing it i suppose i like going at my own pace these days just slamming something out when inspiration hits it few and far between lately but i thank anyone who has stuck with me oh as for the songs i so love the avett brothers right now and that is one of the best songs of the yaer i love the feel it gives me this desire to escape all that has hurt you as for tom petty doesntreally fit the chapter at all but again it the feel that does it for me so forlorn and chilling which is what i wanted to convey with this chapter ok longest note ever haha done for auld lang syne my jove kaitlyn chapter 39 the weary kind abc oh may was a glorious month and how quickly it went once it finally came leaves and birds and green grass and blue skies and warm sun and fresh air it was as if we were creatures emerging back into the wild after hibernating for a long harsh winter winter became a distant memory and it was funny that it happened every year you forgot of winter when spring came forgot of spring when winter came by may we were all in this far too deep to have any chance of getting out i thought those words one day thought too far in no chance of getting out i did not understand that i meant even then that there was no chance of getting out of this alive sirius beautiful wonderful soulful bitter tormented sirius was likely in love with marlene mckinnon and his cheeks were rosy much of the time from all of the drink he had that was a polite way to put it rosy cheeks from drink that was a romantic way to think of what a drunk he had become a drunk who could i would give him this handle his drink well and be drunk always without appearing drunk but then again maybe that was the signs of alcoholism in any case that kind of disease or addiction or whatever was not really a concern in these times everyone drank and smoked and forgot as much as they pleased lately no one judged anyone with a flask or pack of fags always on hand how else were we meant to get through it sirius was a drunk but a useful drunk and we gave him that he took it seriously and he fought the battles and oftentimes he limped his way home and this all meant so much to him when i looked at sirius i felt an undying connection to him and i hoped to watch him come through this alive and well and in love and an important constant in my and my husband lives by may that lush green fresh aired wide eyed new beginning while we were stuck in the deadest of ends feeling may i had started smoking and stopped eating and the weight i d gained over the winter fell away or rather shifted to other parts as my thighs and backside grew but my boobs shrank and my ribs were sharp my stomach uneasy most of the time i was looking forward to summer to vanish the sallow colour of my skin catch up on sleep so black circles disappeared and i was looking forward to summer so i could feel alive again james serious handsome worried loving aged james and i were falling into stride as partners i cared about the order i tried in the order i understood the situation and my fear was giving way to fierceness that matched his own muggleborn and for all intents and purposes a mudblood my stake in this was important lord voldemort was waging war on my very own blood kin and the wrath of this wizard was destroying all of our lives it was the most unacceptable thing i d realized and there was something inside of me that knew this would change our very existence james held some kind of responsibility over sirius making sure remus or peter were often with him and they bare knuckle battled it out one evening when sirius was smashed james teetering on tipsy and we were all pissed off sirius came out of it haughty as ever reckless as the teenager he was with the worst black eye i d ever seen it was swollen and purple and black and blue and he was proud as anything over it james broke a knuckle or two and his nose it was funny to me that this war this feud this battle against the dark side was so incredibly in the incapable hands of young witches and wizards with a penchant for being volatile we had our elders and those adults to guide us but we had not even turned twenty yet and were head over feet involved in this were i not to be drunk and bare legged and tan and single and fun at nineteen we would have been different people without this war i yearned for the beach by the time may turned to june as it so quickly did just by the time you were comfortable with it for the salty ocean air was a kind of comfort that reminded me of my childhood with my grandparents they lived near the ocean and oh when it was warm when it was summer it was beautiful and calming and i decided to plan a trip he ticked off at you eh sirius had a habit of being around the most when james and i were struggling although this was a rarity the periods of struggle lasted long enough to wear on the nerves and will to carry on what of it we were out on the grand veranda of our godric hollow home and when we moved here in the winter i did not believe we would ever see summertime he grinned and the ice in his glass clinked as he swallowed some of the whiskey and let out a hiss of pleasure afterwards it was his drink of choice and he smelled of it so often i did not mind anymore summertime was always good to sirius in ways that it hadntthe chance to be good to me that man could walk outside for mere minutes under the sun and come in looking as if cherokee ran in his blood although it was more likely to be some french instead he was evenly tan although his forehead was a bit more red than the rest of him he d wear his shirts with a couple of buttons undone and jeans so threadbare they might as well not be there sometimes he d dress it up with beige shorts but his arms were always on display and rightfully so they were muscular and tan and he and i were a wonderful contrast lover spat always lightens things up hmm he too dark now i think needs to loosen up a bit it is honestly i paused to drag long off a cigarette and inhale deep and let it out slowly all because i want to go to the beach i want to get a tan and swim in the ocean and fall in love with him again i even said you lot could come that seemed to make it worse he becoming his dad still got his hair for now but otherwise he his father he sacrificed his personal life for professional and prongs well prongs just cantfind the lines aye there really isntany professional life right now so he getting his wires crossed with you and the order but you re apart of the order he just has no separation i think he acts ancient but he nineteen i dontexpect miracles from him none of us understand this i smoked and smoked and drug it down into my lungs and held it there and felt fit to burst before breathing out the haze of smoke enveloped where we sat on the veranda and we both sighed and crickets were singing frogs talking dusk falling a chill in the june air and it was strange to be alive what a day for the weary sirius said and he looked at me with really open eyes for the first time in a long time i weary lily this isntthe time to be weary my friend hear hear he raised his glass and drank the remnants of whiskey kicked his feet up onto the railing and folded his hands over his stomach which was softer than his days as a always on the go fast metabolism hogwarts student he looked moody for a moment and frowned whatever he sounded so juvenile it was endearing the sun was set and the last glow washed over the porch and i thought of running and sirius was suddenly moody for whatever reason and then james returned home setting his things down and i wondered if he was built to be alone in a way i could not be hi sirius and i called in unison and he joined us outside after pulling a sweater on i loved june evenings that were cool enough for sweaters mild enough for bare legs and drinks and cigarettes on the veranda fading bruises either from his and sirius fight or that one botched order plan were shadows beneath his glasses and he was darker sirius was right both in appearance and presence evening dear love of my life sirius grinned sloppily and james rested a hand on my shoulder and then bent down for a kiss took the words from my mouth he muttered to me and i squeezed his hand go home sirius james told him and he nodded one more smoke with the wife and i off i handed him the pack and lit my own and james sat in the chair across from me he was not a judgemental non smoker and none of us were really non smokers or smokers or non drinkers or drinkers anymore whatever we felt like we did and when we were tired of it we stopped there was a level of control over certain things in our life that we needed everything else was falling away and quite fast but we could decide to smoke decide to eat to drink to love to hate to stay to try to laugh to cry to be strong or fall apart you do it wrong lily sirius chided as he puffed on his own and he blew smoke rings starting small and growing larger you know i only started smoking because i wanted to practice smoke rings i laughed and james shook his head chuckling a bit it funny because it true sirius fumbled through some instructions on how to properly inhale and increase the tar intake into my lungs but i did not listen just taking small drags and creating smoke rings of my own it best to smoke at night so you can see the smoke rings daytime smokers are the true addicts most of what he said was ridiculous seeing marlene tonight james asked sirius and i figured he was trying to push the relationship with marlene so he would stop drinking so much and contain himself a bit i was not sure it would work because although they were nearing the point of an official relationship his boozing was as hardy as ever mayswell he mumbled finished his cigarette kissed me on the cheek and i felt decidedly grown up and classy as i arched my neck out and held the cigarette in my hand at an angle away from our faces and it felt like we were some from movie clapped james on the back and then disapparated james looked serious again as his best mate left he did not speak as we went inside watched the evening news ate a quick meal he did not speak for a long time and it was around 11 when i was considering a shower to deal with the tangled mess of hair on my head and the stank of smoke on my skin that he spoke again just come to bed he was already there propped up with pillows dressed in plaid shorts and with the quilt pulled over his legs but revealing his naked torso no no not tired didntdo much today i drifted off into my own thoughts as i stood tangling my hair around my fingers come to bed he said more pointedly and i noticed his glasses were off and so was the wireless set on the nightstand usually he was tuned into some information news station most of the night or else sports huh what no maybe i ll make us a snack i patted my stomach and twisted around to look at my reflection in the mirror james steady gaze on me the whole time it was a comfortable night and we left the windows open shades pulled up and we could hear passersby either heading out or back home after a night at the pub and cars rolling along the road it was comforting something like when things were quiet at night and you could hear a plane overheard some connection to an outside world to know however impossible things may be we were not alone he used his wand to turn the lights off leaving us in darkness save for moonlight and suddenly lit candles on the dresser come to bed softer and quieter but huskier and no less demanding this time i fumbled through the darkness and climbed into bed pulling the covers over my bare legs the strap on my top sliding down and i reached for him through the shadows hi i said and he muttered it back rubbing his hands down my arms you ve been quiet all day he stayed quiet still hands doing the talking as he pulled the other strap of my top down why should i sleep with you when you wonttalk to me he laughed and i might as well have because who was i kidding when his hands went places and his lips followed too much to say most of the time lips on my ear and then my neck and he paused there my pulse quickening against his kiss sometimes i still felt young and innocent and naive when he touched me and it was invigorating i your wife i want to hear it i murmured but he was persistent and he tossed my top away but then stopped and just pulled me close and we listened to the sounds of the night sometimes even when we were intimate like this i wished there was more than just him and me i wished sirius would stay or remus would visit or bridget would come back or alice and frank would bond with us or even peter around would be nice they were there during some days but the nights were nighttime was lovely and my favourite time but they were lonely and long and dark hours and it was hard to find a balance i love you he moved again rolling gently to lay atop me and when he was this close his body an impossible distinction from my own i felt insane and weak with need i could barely breathe when he finally kissed my mouth and his hands went up my legs and he groaned and he was such a leg man one hand on my thigh and the other gripping the hair at my scalp there was nothing besides him that night and it was fine and perfect and close close closest we d ever been love you too i thought i said but it was lost in a whisper and oh maybe we could stay caught up in a perfect june night forever and we would all be fine fine fine abc please please please let me get what i want by the smiths abc in times of war times of hiding and running and secrets funerals were not public affairs when we were still at hogwarts when james dad died and bridget ray died there were funerals attended by many and things were still okay building up and tense but nothing like it would be when members of our order and of the wizarding community at large just started disappearing there were no funerals it was clear they were gone and dead and we did not need to see the green light to confirm it there was no sense wondering if oh yes voldemort did find them but they must ve escaped to somewhere they were done in and somehow at that time no closure no conclusion to their lives was cruel cruel torture but also made it more bearable would all of these wonderful kind courageous people not just return when it was all over with there was a war but it was some kind of fictional thing and it would end eventually and gravemarkers would be unturned as people went home started their real lives had a good laugh about it all it was certainly enough to make me lose my mind funerals were not public affairs anymore when we lost dorcas meadowes personally at the hands of voldemort we all gathered in the stuffy order headquarters crammed chairs and choking heat to say a few words about her and throw back a few drinks in her memory it was july and we were sweaty and moody and depressed and i would have been perfectly happy to stay in the cramped headquarters not having to step back out into this so called real world dumbledore was for the first time since i had known him starting to look older he was ancient to begin with but you could tell now the stress from all of it could even weigh dumbledore down and it showed in the lines on his face the darkness in his eyes dumbledore was starting to worry so were we whereas june passed with a lovely slow warm grace july began hurried and murderous and mournful i hated that i only appreciated things once they were gone and so many things were now gone june though lasted june went slow and the air dripped with honey and dew and humidity from just past thunderstorms we made a trip to the beach a couple of nights alone and the rest of the week with remus sirius marlene peter and the longbottom in tow there were bonfires and beer and late nights watching the stars come out or early mornings watching the sun rise we swam and ate and drank and i burned then browned and there were more freckles on my skin but i also had some tan the salt stained our skin and textured our hair and we all came back from the week away looking better for the wear i felt some peace love life motto after that week and wished it were simpler to change most things we were losing the war i remembered a conversation in june that long lovely june with james about the longbottom s when we had gone away to the beach it was easier to say some things like we loved each other and were fearful but also hopeful but mostly mostly just terrified alice had beamed at all of us around the bonfire and squeezed frank hand and her eyes were a bit glazed from the alcohol but no less vibrant frank and i are thinking of a baby we re we re trying for a baby she told me later quieter more serious that they just wanted one before it was too late because who knew and yeah who knew but it was wartimes and was a baby going to make anything better or just more complicated but i could not deny that she looked lovelier and happier and her and frank love was so evident in everything they did james and i had come home and relaxed on the couch and were fatigued but in a satisfied way and i held his hand and tangled my legs with his and asked him what he thought do you want to have a baby he did not sound shocked or even let on he heard me for a few moments why was all he said and the quiet steady wonderful man he was let my mind wander far away from the times we were in well frank and alice are we re losing the war god james we re losing the war do you want to have a baby just to get it over with just because we can and who knows how longer that ll be true and because we love each other a baby that d be some kind of salvation right now dontyou think no no no no i dontwant hmm a smile inexplicably formed on his lips and he closed his eyes but shook his head no i dontwant a baby i mean to say not now not at nineteen not with a so called dark lord around not when there moral peril around every corner if i wanted a baby it would be with you though and thinking of a green eyed little one it hard to say no but no no that ridiculous do you want to have a baby i did not let myself think of a baby with a head full of messy black hair and my green eyes and maybe james nose but my smile i didntthink of it and just said what i meant what i knew to be true in my mind but where my heart betrayed me no i dontwant a baby i kissed him we didnttalk of it afterwards and a baby at nineteen my god was so far out of the question but maybe it would be a girl with my eyes or maybe it d be a boy with james hair and she d like charms and swimming but the boy would play quidditch and everyone would say you play well like your father but you have your mother eyes the longbottom had been trying for a baby longer than they let on for two weeks into july a month after they first told us i went to stay with alice for a week because she had miscarried she d been likely two months along and had gotten ill and bony and stress on top of that well it was too much and her body let go she bled so much they could have lost her too maybe it just the universe letting on that a baby isntthe most practical thing right now james desensitization to the situation surprised me maybe they were stupid to think it could work i glared at him and shouted at him and my going to stay with alice was not so much at her request as it was my insistence the month between our long lovely june vacation and our murderous july had taken an impact on us the summer moved as if a season fully detached from the rest of the year and meanwhile i felt fully detached from myself and could scarcely remember how i once was or what i thought of in school or of the days and years i had already lived it was strange to forget who i was it was strange to look at him in the middle of july when it was so hot and the sun was so bright sky so blue and wonder where he came from and if it wasntfor me where would he be if we had not married so young if we had not found love or something akin to love love enough to bet our lives on it where would he be what would he do how would he love i imagined a colder man someone beyond their years and proud of it stiff upper lipped and uncompassionate i did not want to see it happen to him although it was before my very eyes there was more to the world than death plans the order aurors voldemort and death eaters there was love and light and babies and hope and for him to truly look at frank and alice loss as well not much of one i did not understand him i could not imagine him changing so greatly for if he had i could not be with him but how could i not be with him and i just wanted to help him to make him stay as he was but more than that i wanted to be away from him there was a struggle going on but this one was internal i prayed for us while i was gone abc remus dear werewolf remus came calling to alice mid week after a hard night out with frank and although they had worked hard they were also likely drunk he hugged alice and told her he was sorry and there was a sincerity in him that was lacking in most people during these times i handling it all right she admitted nodding and she was still pale still shaky it was scary the whole thing scary to be pregnant scary to be scared scary to lose it frank wrapped her in a sweater and the warmth that radiated around them was so intimate that remus and i left the room stepping into the kitchen to give them a moment are you going to get divorced so soon remus asked as he rummaged through the fridge for a beer he handed me one as well why on earth would you ask that my closest friend just had a miscarriage and her husband is running around trying to save the world with everyone else she couldntbe alone he nodded and cracked his beer drinking it and i noticed he was dressed handsomely remus looked better sometimes and it was good to see well that he could he wore muggle clothes a pair of grey trousers a white button down and a matching suit jacket the whole thing was rumpled and some buttons were undone as well as the cuffs but he looked good and well adjusted and he looked normal sirius was a drinker and james was hardening but remus seemed to be perhaps he was just so well jaded from years of torment and judgement that things could not get much worse he handled it as he handled his life i just so tired of it all i told him and he agreed raising his beer to mine and swigging it down it looked like maybe he was getting laid some good hearted woman in his life i didntknow but i hoped and wondered and smiled at him it was easy to like remus now the summer just disappearing he offered and i nodded wide eyed maybe someone else had the same skewered perception of time as i had most things dontmake sense time passes in great chunks you know weeks go by and then time stops when something happens good or bad and we re paused and then chunks disappear again it was a clunky unattractive way to describe the passing of our lives poor alice he said and his face fell his forehead crumpling and his eyes darkening and he bit his lip and broke my heart i know i strained and put a hand to my throat thinking of how frank had found her in the bathroom barely conscience and realized it was all over rushing her to st mungo and praying hard it like it so confusing because everyone offed with a wave of a wand these days but but alice had something real something horrible happen you know it all real and horrible but no i know losing a baby bleeding out on the bathroom floor that real that traumatic and horrible and it a part of life sitting waiting for some lord wizard to creep around the corner to flash a green light it comical almost isntit is this all really happening i squeezed remus hand with my own and was it how could it all really be happening i wondered when i d worry about bills and employment and holidays spent with family how to spread it out and babies and friends and houses it was times like these times like alice miscarriage that i realized some day there d have to be more than this some day we d be real people living real lives instead of this war this warfare was ruining us i felt like i thought too much about hating it wanting a change waiting for it to be over than wondering how it could ever actually end why are you here i seem to remember this husband of your buying a grand house and wanting you to enjoy your summer in it your lives i leaned against the counter and remus rumpled his too long hair in a way that was so decidedly james that my heart pained james is just struggling we all are but james is just so hard sometimes he basically called the longbottom crazy for even wanting a baby said it was some karmic retribution that they lost the baby universe saying it wasntthe right time it just stupid it just stupid of him they can have a baby if they want and she lost it had a life inside of her that she wanted to thrive and she lost it it was so insensitive i just wondered what if it were me would he be happy about it if it happened to us i dontknow he so changed so hard sometimes remus nodded tight lipped sandy haired handsome but weary so weary seems like his father a lot to me lately too in his blood i suppose to take it the way he does we re young but not at heart you know we re bloody middle aged at heart prongs just doesntknow how to none of us do just think though he gets the way he does because he wants to make a better world and he especially wants a better world so you two can reproduce like rabbits when it all over i laughed and nodded but did not feel at ease and was doubtful i ever would again it was strange to find myself wishing for a broken heart or some kind of pain because at least broken and pain was feeling and it was easy to not feel at all to declare numbness over pain but no broken hearts were so passionate and lively and beautiful i wondered if i stayed away from james long enough i d remember what a broken heart felt like and i wondered if i was going to become my mother i so did not want to be her but maybe she was different than i remembered and it was shocking to not quite remember i thought i knew who i was but in a way i d never really recovered and had any of us too many thoughts for my defeated little mind abc more adventurous by rilo kiley abc he hugged me as soon as i came home and his touch left goosebumps on my arms and he said that sirius had gotten hurt and his mother was ill and he was sorry so sorry and i told him so was i we had not the time to get caught up in the chaos around us if we were to have any time together together we were strong but divided it was pathetic as if our core were missing and we had half a brain and i felt lifeless without him and so warm with him we went to visit his mother and sister and she was sweet but sad and insightful while dani was so fragile and broken hearted since jude perhaps i was wrong about broken hearts i remembered the hurt pushing me to the brink and back and i remembered the blood pumping again and breathing quickly and there was such tangible feel of life in broken hearts as teenagers i suppose losing the love of your life forever was different than the finicky loves of children i felt sick when i hugged her and never wanted to feel that way to lose james and also myself with him are you taking care of him dani asked me and somehow i smiled crinkly eyed we re taking care of each other he so strong mrs potter she took the turn to smile and said i too was a mrs potter and i finally felt apart of this in an entirely whole well way oh just dontlet him go he might be strong somehow but he got a tender heart james does sirius too but he more headstrong than james he ll fracture but james will lose his mind not to worry you but just keep close mmm i will we will keep close we were close together in fact and trapped in a botched order plan when we came face to face with so called lord voldemort there was a definite life before my eyes moment an actual blink of my eye and i could not remember how to move until james pushed me aside and dodged a curse and then i slung one and there was a portkey and somehow holy fuck were the first words from our mouths and we were too jumpy and tingly and shaky to look at each other or touch or do anything but breathe james yelled it all onto dumbledore and demanded to know how it was all going so very wrong and the only thing to calm me was a tender near loving moment between sirius and marlene that made me gulp back some strange emotion i felt some sort of motherly instinct of these boys and to know marlene loved sirius enough to hold his hand and smooth down his singed hair and soothe the burns he suffered with both her hands and magic to know that made me happy and feel like there was some love life and they were being taken care of and when did i grow to love all of these marauders so completely we spent the night at the order headquarters fearful of what could happen when we were alone our own families were in pieces and i did not even know mine anymore but we had forged our own in the members of the order and to watch meals be prepared and hear plans discussed in soft whispers was my lull to sleep and if there was salvation in the world hopefully i d wake in the morning abc hi i wanted to get a chapter up so i can progress a bit because by the time i was nearing the end of the chapter i realized it wasntmuch of a mover more of a thinker chapter and i pleased with it and hope to turn out the next chapter more quickly it just always blows my mind how long this has gone and when i still receive reviews i love it so much and completely intend to finish whenever that is and wherever it leaves as you know i horrible at action pieces and not very detail oriented in regards to what is happening at this time ie order and voldemort stuff but i feel like lily piece y recollection and thoughts on it make it rushed and frenzied which is how i feel when i imagine that time also i not encouraging smoking but as it explained in the chapter why would they care just then and i not going to like smoking cigars on nice summer nights was a hobby of mine this summer i just like to incorporate in response to some reviews i dontreally hiatus i just write when i feel like it and unfortunately it doesnthappen as often as i d like but i am impressed with the continuation of this story even as i enter 4th year university take care and i love you all for taking the time for this the name for this chapter was inspired by a song in the movie crazy heart which i loved and jeff bridges oh man and it is great and sad and wonderful check out jenny lewis new album with jonathan rice it gonna hit you with a big wave chapter 4 the sexiness of a voice lost abc it was so nice being one of the only people in the pub tonight there were some people up at the bar sittingon bar stools getting drunk off their arses but we were the only younger ones hogwarts students sirius led us to the front of the place to the register where a then young and very pretty madame rosmerta was serving up the drunks and wiping clean glasses lo m dear sirius greeted the barmaid rosmerta smiled at sirius and set down the glass she was wiping going to the register to ring in what we were to order shouldntyou be in school sirius she said airly observing me briefly and flashing me a smile as well of course now we ll have well i ll have a butterbeer hot cocoa for me i added ohkay and i ve not an idea what i want to eat mmm something good fries with ranch dressing or something double it i nodded laughing a bit because i didntknow if the three broomsticks even served fries with ranch dressing ranch dressing on fries what the hell sirius dug around in his pocket for the money with his hand that wasntcurrently preoccupied with clasping mine still he laid it on the counter and we made our way over the booths against the left wall he allowed me to slide in first before sitting himself where i thought would be on the opposite side of the table but he slid into the seat next to me briefly his hand let go of mine to tug his gloves off and lay them on the table and then he picked it back up keeping them clasped on the table his fingertips gently tickled the back of my hand and then using his index finger only he traced it up and down each of my fingers still managing to keep a grip on my hand he hadntpulled his lovely grey blue eyes away from my hand yet and when he spoke it was in a bit of a murmur i realize i acting like i obsessed but i ve always had a bit of a thing for holding hands and yours are so pretty he pulled his eyes up to mine and cracked a smile and i probably making you feel uncomfortable he made to let go of my hand but i thelp but keep it squeezed in place you re not i assured i swear you re not i watched him as he watched my hand softly tickling my palm and brushing his fingertips elegantly over my whole hand normally i would ve been laughing at the showering tickles but there was something pertubedly serene and calming about it i shivered and he finally let my hand fall loose as the food drinks came to the table just at the same time never realized french fries ranch dressing could taste so good i grinned and sirius chuckled a bit i have a feeling you re making fun of my love he dipped a few more fries in the dressing and ate them your love wow i took another small bite from the fries and surrendered to sipping my hot chocolate so his voice was thick and he tipped his head from side to side as he finished chewing what it feel like being eighteen mmm i dontknow i ve only been it for a few hours i going to assume not much different maybe even worse than the rest of the teen years i mean i was going to start complaining again i didntknow whether or not i had the right to it weird i guess my mum not sending me anything for my birthday i dunno i trailed off as sirius leaned back against the back of the seat and cricked his neck putting his hands behind his head and sighing quietly not sure my mum ever acknowledged one of my birthdays i froze and went cold god i was so fucking stupid sirius black home life sucked you pick things up over the years and when sirius black is in gryffindor and his brother relatives are in syltherin it makes you start putting things together i dontknow how he stood it there later of course i found out that sirius black lived with the potter for the majority of the time he wasntat hogwarts and in his 6th year was left a fortune from an uncle or someone who died and actually cared for him along with that fortune was a house after i came to find out that james sirius had lived together like brothers it hit me as to why i always admired them so much it sounds absolutely ridiculous admiring them for having such a friendship when for some years i didnteven speak to them but it was just how they were that left me yearning for it almost i mean yes they were typical potty mouted boys but they had obtained a friendship so unlike any i had seen they they cared you could tell they cared the way they non ceasingly stuck up for one another the way they d give each other a clap on the back when passing between classes the way one could give a simple nod and the other would smile or laugh as if that nod had said thousands the way they d fight and would brood over it for weeks until they stopped being so bloody stubborn and both were forced to apologize by remus remus was probably the backbone of the marauders some of the time but remus will be later for sirius james are right now when james grandfather died sirius was as devastated as his best friend and they both went to the funeral when sirius had come back from the summer of 2nd year perhaps the only summer he had spent at home bruised beat up james cussed his bloody head off and called his best friend every name in the book because apparently he was stupid enough to go back there he was hardly thirteen for christ sake but when james called sirius on something which he didntoften do sirius damn well took note of what he was doing wrong and he fixed things he fixed the abuse by leaving the fuckin black family and seeking redemption with the potter s their friendship was incredible and in later years often left me with shining tears filled with admiration god i sorry i going on like some kind of idiot just i sighed i dontknow i quite selfish i think sirius smiled and ran a hand through his hair before letting his head tip back to rest on the edge of the seat you re quite wonderful really lily evans a girl who had it all and it all was ripped away and you re left on your eighteenth birthday with not a card of proof and only the company of a stranger i honestly did look around me looking for the stranger who was in my company before realizing it was sirius maybe he was right in the sense that we hadntdelved that far into each other lives yet and we hadntexchanged worst childhood memories and we hadntpoked much fun at james quiet ways but we had talked of birthdays shopped and shared a meal if it snowed the second snow of the season things would just seem to be set right yeah sirius was a stranger because we hadntknown each other properly enough to see the snow fall together but in that moment with him basked in the slightly quivering light of the three broomsticks he seemed to be the only person in the whole wide world that i did know and i felt i knew him well it came as a surprise to me when i was finishing my hot chocolate that i felt something gently pressing against my knee and sirius left hand was gone beneath the table i didntknow what to think and i felt bloody stupid for giving a startled oh and slopping some of my hot chocolate onto the table sirius was hungrily finishing off his fries and didntseem to notice my sudden awareness of his hand his warm hand pressed against my knee his warm hand pressed against my knee and his roughened thumb making small fucking irresistible circles against it i bit my lip and looked at sirius from the corner of my eye oblivious to my almost freaking out state almost freaking out because i thought i liked the feel of his hand much too much mmm i cleared my throat and he finally turned to me um your hand is well what s that mean then your hand on my knee this for whatever reason seemed to offend him and shatter his demeanor oh absolutely nothing evans james i thought was the only one who jumped back to last name basis sirius stood up grabbing his backpack and slinging it over his shoulder shoving his hands deep in his pockets before storming out through the door and there was the ding of a bell i noticed though that he was still smooth enough to offer a little wave to rosmerta up at the bar and one of his smiles what i didnttear out of the door after him for a moment but when i did i tore fast sirius i called breathlessly flinging my scarf about my neck what was that about i dontknow i hadntexpected him to spin around and come back like that but he did a hand flew through his hair and he breathed heavily it floating up in the frosty air for us both to see i so fucking frustrated with this he turned away from me and his shoulders rose and fell with is breathing if a girl doesntwant my hand on her knee well normally i wouldntreally give a shit he spoke sharply and was gesturing wildly but but you there something about this that going to have me fucking insane before the year out i knew my eyes were wide and i was blinking excessively to try to make that less noticable but i had never seen sirius black lose everything that was himself in a moment he was so smooth so unflawed even though beneath it all he was full of em but his smooth way of things just made you forget that made you forget he probably seen more then any of us ever will if there was ever a definition of who was cool and who wasn t sirius black would be that definition it sounded childish and whatever else but he was here he was losing that cool because i drove him insane i couldnthelp but feel the slighest bit proud over that as the world seemed to fall down and everything ultimately changed time had flew and i was standing there as light hearted and proud as i was feeling i didntknow what to say i couldntsay haha i make you insane that just floats my boat and makes me happier than anything but i couldntsay that i didntmean to or something i felt a bit hurt as well i mean it not my fault i had no idea he was experiencing all sorts of different emotions well sorry about that then i pursed my lips slightly shoving my bare hands into my pockets and waiting for him to respond and he did so with a shrug and a gruffness to his voice whatever he adjusted the backpack on his shoulders and turned away in the opposite direction trudging off through the snow the sparkling light snow that was becoming blanketed with with more snow i had just felt my eyelashes grazing my cheeks as i let my lids fall shut and then was wide eyed looking up at the sky and the millions of bloody huge snowflakes falling slowly almost spiralling down to earth he stopped for a moment ran a hand through his hair and i swore to god he was going to turn around i went back to the castle alone cold and alone and without that amazing invisibility cloak to keep me from getting caught and without knowing how to get back into those secrets passages so i was walking back to hogwarts the proper way and the snow hadntstopped falling and sirius still had my necklace sigh things changed so damn fast he had made my birthday just bloody made it matter and made it happy and i was happy but in a split second it had changed because stupid emotions and potential crushes and boys and girls and dhfjkdhfjkhdfjdfh they all get in the way my mind was a mess such a mess in fact that i had wandered into the castle when did it become ten after eleven and well past curfew and walked straight up to gryffindor tower without a second thought of to keep it quiet or keep an eye out but i had managed so whatever i managed until gryffindor tower and i could see the portrait of the fat lady in the pink dress i suddenly became aware of my surroundings my feet were carrying me i was in the home stretch miss evans her voice was always rather high and at times uneven curt and strict and with an air of curiousity as if we might have a good reason for whatever it was the person was doing dear ol professor mcgonagall i plastered a smile on my face cursed myself for not having my head girl badge on and then turned around to face the woman professor how are you this eve her thin lips turned upwards in a satisfied smirk out after curfew with no good reason miss evans is that a trail of slush you ve got on your shoes care to explain where you ve been uh i looked to the portrat hole just feet away i could run in and lock her out oh damn she d know the password think of something think of something not like i wasntalready being horribly obvious she was with me professor y see this one first year wouldntgo to bed until we found the stuffed animal she lost outside yes some little brat dropped it out the window so i ve just been calming her down and lily was out there looking he turned to me with his eyebrows raised didntfind it lily um no no i think the bear was white and it just started snowing again maybe they just hid it on her the kids professor mcgonagall seemed convinced oh my god my ass was just saved kids and their sentimental attachments mmm well goodnight perhaps put your badge on next time you ve got some duties miss evans she turned around her long robes sweeping behind her and the sound of her shoes hitting the floor echoed down the empty corridor for minutes after she dissappeared from our sight oh god i wiped my forehead which was sleek thanks james he sent me a smile you re welcome he was in fact wearing his badge i just off to the kitchens because i starved do you want to come you dontneed your badge if you re with me i bit my lip my only intentions had been dissappearing off to my dorm for the rest of the week and putting sirius black on some kind of hit ignore list but james potter was in a pair of blue green plaid pajama pants and a grey sweatshirt looking delicious warm and friendly james friendly saving my ass inviting me along i couldntresist and i could go for another cup of cocoa as it was it was amazing what these boys knew about this school so amazing maybe it was childish and trivial and something that could get them burned if they were ever found out but all of the secrets and passages were in the school so werentthey there to be found the map sirius had used earlier they made it incredible i was in awe they were brilliant bastards with a bit too much time on their hands and it was amazing i think i was in love with from the start how smart james was challenged me put in me in my place amazed me we walked in a bit of a silence but it was oddly enjoyable and nice i wanted to be as comfy looking as james though i was wearing a pair of dark blue jeans and a white sweatshirt with the brands name written over it in navy writing i had abandonned my cloak scarf and gloves just had the fat lady swing open and threw them in but james made casual look somehow handsome debonair we were just going down the marble staircase leading to the entrance hall when james well i guess decided maybe it was a bit of his business to know where i really was i honestly didntthink he ever was going to ask he d start to speak clear his throat and then blush furiously so damn quiet the poor dear um so where were you really tonight evans i kinda thought maybe with sirius because my invisibility cloak and the map was missing he trailed off as he led me down a corrdior i didntsay anything because he was grinning thought so you re not surprised by the invisibility cloak so you must ve been with him i laughed lightly that i was and said nothing more of it till much later we were sitting amongst some adorable house elves helping ourselves to toast honey biscuits bagels cookies my hot chocolate they were all infatuated with mr potter too so it was even more adorable you drinking hot chocolate is rather lovely i dontknow it just matches your he trailed off tilting his head and squinting his eyes your hair your hair red like fire and fire warm as is hot chocolate so you hot chocolate are destined i think that night was the first time james i shared laughs it was it was what i needed it was well after midnight and we were wandering the corridors on our way back to the tower and again i was failing to remember we werentto be out and i wasntquiet as i laughed at almost everything that james said everything was so surprisingly funny with him he was out after curfew he was living up to his marauders name with me yeah i know out after curfew not that big of a deal but i was surprised when james always said that he did cause trouble he wasntlying he had told me some stories of their times and i was warming up to him even more the fire in the common room was still roaring warmly and lighting a bit of the room causing the shadows to dance i sighed as we entered and i kicked my sneakers off rushing over to the sofas nearest to the hearth and settling myself against the cushions it was indescribable how at home i always felt here and how at home i felt with james rather like i felt with sirius james sighed and settled next to me noting his invisibility cloak draped over the arm of the couch good good i had actually started to worry of whether or not sirius had came back something happen tonight evans i met his gaze and he quickly turned it back to his fumbling hands i mean he muttered nervously lily oh i oh i thought he was going to correct his question or make it more polite or even take it back altogether but lily hmm it sounded nice when he said it yeah well i s pose i dunno sirius confused me basically the evening was just friendly and suddenly he s taking my hand and putting his on my knee and telling me i drove him insane and storming off i i dontknow i was quite lost to tell you the truth and hurt for one reason or another that one reason or another being how well things were going on my forgotten birthday and how sirius black made it temporarily worthwhile and then took it all back because well he trailed off and looked to the fire the light dancing in his eyes and bringing him to life in a way i hadntrealized his eyes were so the way it shone i started crying just sobbing trying to stifle them and just sounding more like an idiot as i gasped choked on my own breath james potter looked at me so quickly i thought i had given him a heart attack but then his face turned from alarmed to to soft sympathetic sympathy i hadntthought i deserved it i didn t sirius didntreally give it to me just related to me was i too weak pathetic to begin with to deserve a bit more sympathy i didntcare because james potter was sympathetic looking and i just wanted to die for him right there god lily there was that pretty word again i he knew he he knew i know i mean he sighed heavily and i wanted to do the same i spent all bloody day sneaking around the castle without my cloak trying to figure out how to sneak into dumbledore office and read your file between my crying i gave a bit of a surprised gasp he was going to go nosing around my files that could contain personal information that was the most un james like thing ever no no no not nose into your past or something trust me i ve seen my file a hundred times first page is just a picture and your name gender and date of birth the other pages is all of the good stuff the side of his mouth quirked into a bit of a grin you wouldntbelieve what i had to do to snape that was bad enough to get me sent to dumbledore office he didntelaborate on that and then once i was in i had to have remus peter do some other random act of vandalism to get dumbledore called out and then i accio ed your file saw your date of birth and his smile faded and he shook his head i sorry i gave a shaky sigh that tasted so heavily of uncried tears it ohkay my voice was hoarse from crying and james was smiling a bit again i sorry again for what i about to say james potter loved to apologize but i always love when other people girls lose their voices it s he shrugged those broad shoulders and leaned back against the cushions of the chesterfield it sexy i laughed and smiled and cried some more and as i finished that damn crying i felt james lovely warm hand find my back and begin to tickle rub my back gently just along the spine up and down happy birthday lily evans he said quietly the movement of his large hand making me dizzy with urges sleep his hand alone was so protective he just continued his pattern up and down and i felt as if that one hand was covering everything that was me and hiding it from anyone standing behind me onlooking pointing out my flaws and discovering them i looked up into his almond shaped rather wide and trustworthy hazel green eyes and was overcome with such mind spinning warmth that i almost toppled over i couldnthelp but wonder how protective the rest of him would feel pressed flush against me hiding me completely james potter won me over that night and i dontthink he ever knew how that tuesday morning just gone 1 and the fire was slowly dying together there in the growing darkness of the common room finding out so much more than i think i even wanted to there was something he emotionally did to me that night that never really left ever chapter 5 darling friends left off with lily and james sitting together the common room was warm even if the fire was fading fast and leaving the corners dark and uninviting james was apparently too warm as he tugged his grey sweatshirt off i of course noted that he was wearing a white t shirt on underneath and it lifted up to his chest as he took his sweatshirt from round his neck the light was dim and my eyes hadntmuch time to wander but dammit you could tell he was near perfect i blinked and looked away from him as he seemed aware of my wandering eyes hem he cleared his throat and ruffled his hair and i leaned my head back against the couch tilting it and watching him it s i should fix the fire i watched him approach the hearth and i was shivering violently i pulled the sleeves of my thin sweatshirt down over my hands and felt my eyelids weigh down my nerves seemed to be on end i hadntan idea why this simple nice moment was making me so nervous james potter and his sweater was lay a mere inch away i pulled it on almost surprised at the smell of musky cologne and shampoo near the neck his hair had been damp earlier it seemed he had just showered and my mind did all kinds of wondering he gave me a small smile as he had brought the fire back to life and came to stand at the end of the couch i curled my legs up on the couch putting my hands between my knees to keep them warm and i yawned as i snuggled my head into the back cushions i thought he was going to leave me there to fall asleep the way he was giving me a bit of a soft understanding stare but he sat back down where he had been sitting though the space had become smaller what with my curling up and he was closer than i had ever been to him his shoulder bumped against my face and he turned it allowing me to lift my head up and then fall against his shoulder his left arm the one i was half leaning against as if because of some instinct came to wrap over the span of my shoulders and draped down to my collarbone on the other side i shifted my head snuggling closer and he propped his feet up on the coffee table apparently becoming comfortable himself i rose my hand to touch his own to rub along his gruff yet somehow soft one and it felt fine and nice and james hadntfled yet though did turn quiet i didntcare he was there letting me sit with him becoming closer litterally not emotionally yet it was good to know that that it was out of my control i could mess up pretty hardcore but i didntcontrol everything depending on how you looked at it things control us happy birthday to you he mindlessly traced his hand up and down my shoulder happy birthday to you happy birthday dear lily happy birthday to you his voice was soft and not even really singing but held half a tune hear him singing happy birthday i shook my head and sighed near his neck thank you the top of my head was pressed against his jaw and i felt rather then saw him smile he didntsay anything and it was just a blatant reminder of who he was you know he might be warm and smell like shampoo cologne but not overwhelmingly so and he might be sweet and nice and sympathetic and soft and allowing me to be leaned against his side not hiding my obvious affection towards him at the moment but he was still james james potter and he was still quiet and remarkably insightful but you wouldntknow it because he was so confined and and incredible quiet but incredible he was my own little mystery after that night so james do you have a brother or a sister he smiled a sister she 5 five oh wow hem i grinned and james chuckled softly yeah her name alexandria rose we call her lexi my dad had black hair and i have his black hair and my mum has dark brown hair but when she was younger it was blonde and curly and go figure lexi gets the blonde curly hair and big blue eyes god she adorable what your mum name danielle she called dani and my dad is jude a n i couldntresist lol what your middle name james potter he laughed lightly into my hair and the oddest sensation met me as he seemed to inhale gently i not telling you my mum name was violet my dad name was ethan but by the time james got around to asking me that he grinned and said he already knew there was something about him just then and there and with me that was so different so open and incredible and i had no idea if he d ever be like this again with me so i took hold of the oppurtunity just basked in it and stayed there with him until my eyes were drooping and my head was rather lolling on his shoulder you re tired lily evans he said softly shifting his arm from around me and helping me stand mmm incredibly we can keep talking if you d like because that what we had been doing just just talking nothing too much if i asked him something too personal he d just shake his head and say i not telling you good naturedly but i knew he meant it no you re a second from sleep and i think it d be rather insulting for you to fall asleep while i was talking to you there will be plenty more time for it darling he was twisting his shoulder arm uncomfortably and clenching his fist and what not is your arm asleep i asked laughing hoarsely he said there d be more time for it sigh good he wasntgoing to write me off completely it gross how it tingles he murmured looking to it and i smiled tiredly at him he walked me to the foot of the girls staircase goodnight happy birthday gooooodniiiiiggghhhht i whispered drawing it out as i smiled one last time at him as i readied myself for bed i accidentally shut the drawer on my dresser a bit forcefully and jada abruptly sat up awake she blinked peering at me and then looking to her clocked cursed in surprise what the fuck are you doing getting in at this hour by this time i had pulled my pajamas on and reached my bed crawling quickly in and pulled the hangings shut without answering her i was drained of energy i had none it was such a pleasant feeling though my mind was completely blank and it was rather blissful i couldntthink of anything and no details of the evening were jumping to my brain and causing me to worry ohkay so sirius did whatever he had done but i think it was a bit of a revelation to me and i was assured by james that he wouldnthold a grudge or something because he seemed to be feeling something towards me and so i was alright just laying there seemingly one with my soft matress james hand had ventured up and down my back for so long that the feeling hadntquite yet gone and it was the last thing i remembered thinking about before i was to sleep how many girls could say james hand had been on their back massaging gently well probably not many seeming he didntgo beyond a kiss until the fourth date and seeming he wasntall for public displays of affection so i was basking in the thought of me being the only one james would have touched in such a calming way picture a day where everything fiiine just imagine it the sky is grey ish blue and it not that horribly cold out the sun there and the day might even be considered mild your hair looks good when you wake up and you just run a brush through it after showering you ve decided your legs look quite acceptable in your uniform skirt and you canthelp but wonder if those two handsome boys will notice the lack of length in it after you magically hem it up to above your knees it a tuesday and those suck but everybody so bubbly and you re wondering if you re the one that was contagiously happy and if you re spreading it around to everybody everybody smiling and you ve never used the word fantastic as much as you re using it today that so totally what today was like for me i just woke up and as late as it had been that i went to bed god i was so refreshed what class do we have first i asked to nobody inparticular as breakfast ended and the students filed out of the hall being the stupid head girl i had to stand and wait until everybody had left and make sure no 1st years were trampled to death or something so james potter being the head boy to my head girl was the closest one to me also watching the students leave the great hall care of magical creatures we re outside today good thing you brought your cloak i smiled and stood beside him folding my arms across my chest the same way his were folded though his chest was much more broad and strong i hate being head girl i laughed and put my hair behind my ears as i saw james eyes travelling over the cloak i held in my arms then down further to my legs i dontknow i wanted to feel beautiful feel pretty and attractive and so my skirt was the slightest bit shorter not a big deal i just didntknow why i seemed to be striving to be so attention seeking of two particular boys sirius was passing by us along with remus peter and instead of following the straight path the kids were walking through to the doors he came over to where james i were off to the side he said hello to james and gave me a rather small almost apologetic smile before leaning in close to my ear and whispering in it shouldntyour skirt be a bit longer his eyes trailed impassively down my legs and within a second he was gone walking through the doors to the foyer james raised his eyebrows at me with a grin on his face you two ohkay again then i shrugged my eyes wide as i did so we didnttalk or anything apparently wearing your skirt a bit shorter can fix anything james laughed and walked a step behind me as we left the hall together our care of magical creatures class took place usually near the edge of the forest where our professor would unveil all kinds of rather intimidating creatures i nor the other girls liked this class much the lawn down towards the forbidden forest sloped a bit and with the fresh snow it would be impossible to walk down without slipping sliding and you were one of the lucky ones if you didntland on your bloody arse the marauders without fail always had peter and at least one another rolling down the bit of a hill amusing but not if it was you yourself i put my cloak on and held it around me to block out the slight breeze james i had caught up with the others by now and as the lawn started sloping james hand jumped to the small of my back it seemed a thousand nerve ends lay there and everything about me became warm tingly well even though his intentions werentto make me warm tingly they were more to have a bit of a grip on me so i didnttumble down a few girls looked our way as they trudged through the snow and i glanced up at him the sun rather blinding me but he looked adorable anyways be careful here he muttered there was a slight bump in the snow and beneath it was a rock but you couldnttell until you were practically on top of it so james hand pressed more firmly against my back and he led me around it a cloud passed over the sun and i took that given oppurtunity to gaze up at him again his brow was furrowed with apparent concentration and his nicely defined jaw was clenched gently his hair was so black and he rad oh jesus lily i slipped just as we were reaching the end of the slope y hill and was falling backwards until james hands flew from my back up to under my arms and catching me before i hit the ground oomph i mumbled landing hard on my backside sirius had stumbled down the hill just behind james and he bumped into him sending him off his feet and causing him to drop me sirius would you stay the hell out of the way james snapped standing up and brushing snow off himself he didntbother offering me a hand as sirius did first and i suddenly felt very caught in the middle of something i had not meant to create james didnttalk to me for the rest of the day whether by choice or just he knew how awkward it had become and thought maybe it best to share me or something those were my thoughts sirius james were best friends and i wanted very greatly to be james best friend and i wanted sirius around as much as possible how was i going to going to do that i wondered if they cared as much of me being their friend as i cared of them it not as if i knew them well enough to say i was absolutely in love with their presence alone and i couldntsay whether i preferred james or sirius and i couldntknow whether i was feeling maybe a bit more towards them i was thinking so intently sitting there at supper time that i hadntheard my name being repeatedly said lily lily lily i blinked and knocked my goblet over with the surprise of somebody quite near to my face and quite loud t was jada i scrunched my face up and slid down the bench ignoring my spilled water and sending her an incredulous stare what do you want i asked as she appeared to be studying my face hard i dunno how are you i raised my eyebrows at the question that was so completely lacking any emotion she did this tried to buddy up again and then start nosing around in my business my head slid to my hands and i groaned she was going to ask of the marauders again what the hell do you want she shrugged canta friend talk to a friend i laughed bitterly and shook my head gathering my things and standing up jada just please donttalk to me like i an idiot i swear i not it was incredible sitting there that night in the common room attempting to complete my transfiguration homework it was incredible because i just seemed to realize how very much i sucked at this subject it was 8 o clock and the common room was buzzing people were everywhere laughing arguing finishing homework there wasntmuch quiet and i wasntauthorized to make them be quiet until 9 o clock at the earliest i rubbed my temple and cursed the damn parchment laying in front of me ugly f ing parchment and today had been so pretty and happy to begin with i was as usual sitting over by the fireplace and leaning up against the couch but sitting on the floor my stuff spread out over the low coffee table jada hadnttried to speak to me again nor had james sirius though seemed to be in an absolutely spiffing mood hey lily he cleared his throat as he brought me from my reverie sitting on the couch behind me hey there sirius i set my quill down and turned the best i could to look at him sitting there listen i he fumbled with something shoved into his pocket and then pulled out a quite familiar looking box i couldnthelp but smile i meant to give this to you last night as it was but i dunno i went all prat like so here you are he went to hand it to me but i swept my hair over my shoulder and asked him to put it on he seemed hesitant y know i dontthink i could manage the clasp as it is my yeah he set the necklace down on the table and i frowned slightly at him as he smiled a tight lipped smile before sauntering off i shook my head and blinked just telling myself boys 11 o clock that night and i had surrendered to the couch a hundred times not wanting to finish my homework that had been sitting on the same table for hours i was lay on my stomach staring at the books parchment just wishing it to dissappear course not in the next half hour scrawled some stuff down it made sense whatever i was head girl for a reason wasnti uh because my marks were good last year maybe but whatever i tried at a quarter to twelve i realized i was completely alone and i smiled it felt nice almost as nice as this morning felt i sighed and settled into the couch cushions laying on my stomach again just watching the fire dance and leap making me drowsy with some kind of warmth that only these very few things could create a warm fire during the bitch month november a cup of hot cocoa getting up early and basking in that fact but you have to be warm when you wake up early because it absolutely depressing when you wake up early and are freezing and leaning your head on a boys shoulder when you just want to let every last thing on the earth be good to you and consume you and why not surrender to the enemy just for a moment because the enemy just happens to have a very comfortable and fitting shoulder and a kiss a soft sweet kiss all bring that warmth i heard some rustling and movement and well i hadntbeen as quite alone as i thought i had seen him sitting there throughout the evening y know just reading for hours only talking to remus ignoring peter and rolling eyes to the loud and attention given sirius he d send me glances which i d try to ignore because i hadntan idea whether the glances were i ll give you a smile if our eyes meet ones or if they were you are getting between me and my best friend and i m a brilliant bastard so i could destroy you james potter was intimidating in his own reserved way and apparently that love for sleep he had during the day didntstand true at night i hadntseen him go to the dorms earlier than midnight he came over and stood behind the couch and i had my face pressed sideways into a pillow being entranced by the fire but i knew he was there you get the strangest feeling when a new presence is near you or somebody watching you sleep highly overrated yeah i muttered rubbing my eyes and willing myself to sit up i ve been sat there like some pansy ass for the entire evening wondering whether or not i should speak to you he spoke so quietly i had to replay what he said in my mind a few times in order to figure out what it had been why wouldntyou just come over and talk to me i needed saving from homework i yawned and sat up smiling at him and knowing my hair was tosseled but just felt so damn comfortable when he was around james leant against the couch muttering something his gaze focused entirely on his hands i tilted my head and grinned gently as if i could coax it out of him a bit louder pardon i didnthear you he ran a hand through his hair and then tilted his head back staring up and swallowing hard his adam apple was just then apparent to me and it was bobbing noticably i said i think we re getting in deep here i raised my eyebrows slightly a bit shocked i guess chewing the corner of my mouth i patted the couch cushion come sit his jaw was clenched and he swallowed again seeming to memorize the expression on my face at that moment he came and sat and every intense feeling that was there the night before had returned sat on the same couch in the same position james just being so incredible i hadntan idea what i was doing i looked at him and nodded taking a deep breath i want you around james his hazel green eyes sharply turned to me and he seemed to be doing the exact opposite of what i was doing i was breathing quicker and i wasntsure he was breathing at all i donthave a lot of friends which may be the most heart shattering thing a girl has to admit i trailed off and the box with the necklace in it caught my attention still sitting there on the table something must be wrong with me yeah i laughed lightly more just to try to calm myself then because it was funny because it wasn t i just you sirius i know we hated one another at first and sirius seems to jump head first into things and think about them later and i ve not an idea what going on in my head besides the fact i want you around i want sirius around as well and when i say around i mean friends i want to be friends but with sirius it so hard because he so positively charming and always seems to be looking for a good time rather then just letting me talk or be or just to sit and you god i want to be your best friend his brow was furrowed and i wondered whether he was good at taking compliments or not like sirius was i mean i just admire who you are that much i donteven know who you are though it the strangest thing in the entire world and i he said not a word he didntblink he didntbreath irregularly he didnteven look as if he was out of his mind because i swore he was because he was doing something james potter would never do and it was the sweetest thing in the whole damn word he pushed me gently back against the couch and my eyes went wide with all sorts of oh no s as i swore he was going to kiss me crazy but he didn t hadntthe intention of it at all of course and i wouldntwant that him to kiss me i mean that would be awful well not quite awful just wouldntquite help the road to friendship along his head tilted as he carefully held my eyes in place with his absolutely darling ones a smile flitted over his features but it was just as quickly gone as he slowly leaned forward brushing pieces of my hair away from my forehead and then he placed his lips on it my forehead in the softest most appreciated kiss still he said nothing and i could hardly keep my eyes open with the rush of dizzying everything i was experiencing you know it like you you handle a lot lily and you donthave to lose your mind over little things like this being friends because i m more than willing darling lily darling darling lily lily darling lily darling my god my head swam and i was swaying towards his shoulder almost subconciously and resting my head against it he put his arm around me and said nothing more and holy fuck i was warm the fire and the boys shoulder and the softest sweetest kiss abc chapter 6 secrets abc secrets are these twisted words of profound confessions usually spilled on occasions of late nights or days where you grow weary of everyone around you secrets can shape destroy and make a friendship they can tell a person more about you or they can completely throw the person off and they ll know even less of you or secrets can intrigue a person and they ll want to know even more of you or they can repel a person from wanting to delve any further secrets are the complex webs of which we weave every single day of our lives i felt as if i was living a secret you know everybody else seemed to know things know where they were going or even where they d like to be going but here i was walking these secretive halls wanting these secretive boys playing by these secretive rules se cret sekrit sekrit n something that remains beyond understanding or explanation a mystery remus lupin he was a secret if there ever was one james well he was my mystery my own little plot and plan and discovery but the realization of how gorgeous remus lupin was hit me hard sitting there at breakfast on a thursday november 30th last day of that wretched month oh my dad did sent me a sorry i forgot your birthday letter it was i hated to admit it quite nice i got it 2 days after my birthday sent me some money as well my mum well nothing my dad also sent on my grandparents card money so well i was happy about that not so with my mum but my dad was always daddy i was watching the marauders from the corner of my eye as i spread jam on my toast sirius was begging for remus to let him copy his potions homework and james was leaning back in his chair looking right amused and peter just i dunno trying to look amused as well remus hair was sandy blonde it wasntquite as shaggy as sirius or james s and not quite as all over the place as james s but it fell into his eyes at times and it went all different directions near the back of his head his hair was straight and looked lusciously silky and he d run his hand back through it to keep it from his eyes let me tell you i certainly wouldntmind doing the favour for him i had seen him up close talked friendly with him but i dontthink i ve ever gotten the chance to look him right in the eye they were blue a stormy blue you know not light light blue they were a pretty blue though darker blue sirius had facial hair much of the time he was never completely clean shaven and james even had the occasional stubble beneath his lip remus hair being as light as it was you could hardly see whether he had any facial hair so he looked so clean cut suave god that was the word for him i wouldntgo as too far as to describe him as delicate or something just suave he was so handsome pretty that you just didntwant to touch him or even for him to move professor mcgonagall looking stern had pulled sirius james away for a word and remus smirked as sirius shoved remus homework back towards him muttering under his breath i grinned and gathered my composure watching peter scurry off after the professor marauders declaring i helped i helped remus looked quite satisfied as he shoved his homework into his school bag and took a drink of his juice i cleared my throat as i sat down across the table from lupin hey there he almost spluttered on his juice but quickly caught himself and smiled at me hello head girl wondering where your head boy off to ah it such a great story he folded his arms over his chest and continued right on smiling no i just wanted to talk to you actually remus skin had the slightest bronze to it like he spent his fair share of time outdoors but his skin wasntabsolutely damaged by it it gave him a sort of divine glow but i noticed quickly that his cheeks held the slightest tinge of red talk to me mmm you ve already got two under your spell it was my cheeks turn to tinge red oh god i put a hand to my forehead and was point blank embarrassed i dontknow what to sa ay now remus laughed lightly that how it was lightly just absolutely free of any tainted thoughts just kidding head girl neither of them has gone very in depth concerning you must mean something of course hadntgone very in depth concerning me i wasntsure how that made me feel rather squirm ish i thought that if i was coming to mean anything to the pair of them at least remus would know well let not talk about them how are you on this absolutely frigid day i leaned my elbows on the table and propped my hands up under my chin watching him almost admirably urgh he shuddered as if the cold was his worst fear so little did i know though the cold his worst fear laughable really after i found out everything i would i hate the cold november just seems to be one of the coldest months you know december you ve become accustom to it but november just isntright and it been so bloody windy i nodded and sighed my eyes going to the ceiling of the great hall which of course reflected the sky outdoors it appeared grey cloudless without sun just grey absolutely depressing and how are you he threw in with a cheeky grin that was contagious oh better than i have been mmm both of our gazes went to the doors of the great hall as the 3 stolen marauders were returning mmm remus nodded you can tell he looked back to me that you re happier and if james sirius have anything to do with that i ll personally make sure they never do anything to take that smile from your face oh aw remus was so sweet bittersweet in some ways i came to find you re sweet remus lupin he leaned across the table and folded both of his hands very near mine i smiled and looked to them touching the knuckles of my clasped hands to his for a split second we should get together sometime tonight or something just talk i want in on this cra zay lily evans action i giggled and shook my head slowly wait no i giggled that seemed to be a bit of a shock to james sirius as well because they stopped short as they approached where we were sat oh god giggled what i just what dammit boys see it their fault the marauders they re so damn appealing every one of them except for peter but who cares sirius smirked and folded his arms as he sat down beside me leaning fully on the table and burying his head in his arms detention for a bloody week he muttered and remus laughed good he said pointedly raising his eyebrows sharply james had sat down next to remus and folded his arms as well looking rather sulky or as if he were brooding i tried to get his attention but he wouldnthave it i bit my lip and slid down in the bench in order to have my foot nudge against his leg i got his attention and he nodded his head at me i smiled slightly but he just shook his head what wrong i mouthed as remus sirius and peter argued over something ignoring us he shook his head i slid my foot up his leg and his jaw clenched i grinned and he shook his head though a bit of a grin was tugging at his lips i slid my foot up to his knee and then rested it in his lap doing the same with the other though i was sat directly across from remus and sirius was sat directly across from james so in order to get my legs to reach to james i had to slide down the bench some towards sirius and was leaning a bit into him uh lily he pushed my shoulder gently and i blinked myself from my footsies with james rendezvous oh god i realized just how great this would be looking to sirius as of late my feet in james lap me grinning widly james swatting at my feet dammit i blushed a bit sorry hi nobody said anything remus looked to sirius sirius looked to james james looked to remus remus looked to me i looked to james james looked to sirius sirius looked to me james looked to me they were all looking at me i grinned my cheeks flaming and the toothy grin was false as hell but i nodded and said a quick ta before standing from the bench and walking quickly from the hall with my head held high hoping i wasntwearing the short skirt today and wishing boys wouldntwatch girls from behind bloody hell i was leaning against the wall as classes were to begin and people walked through the halls have you ever just watched people observed people wondered what the look on their faces meant what they were thinking none of the marauders had gone to class together sirius walked by first heading towards the dungeons for potions and then followed peter remus was looking pensive as he walked by taking big strides then came james he was the only one of them who looked at me it seemed as if in slow motion slowly turning his head towards me rumpling his hair slowly walking slowly and he stopped stopped walking people bumping into him sending him odd glances as he just stood there my mouth opened slightly as i tried to think of something to say anything something lily darling dammit think he was pressing his lips together as he walked over to me leaning against the wall with me you thinking what i thinking he muttered quietly trying to downcast his eyes and not look at people looking at him i swore i looked afraid as i turned to him with wide eyes saying nothing i just looked at the smile on his face i swallowed hard and shrugged a bit i thinking that you ve suddenly got more friends than you bargained for he spoke softly and as usual i could hardly catch his words but that was the thing i always did always heard him anyway my mouth was open again and i tried to speak but there was nothing i could say to argue or agree or because i didntknow i didntknow what i was doing thinking or feeling and it was pleasantly scary pleasantly i that was so wrong of me to think but it was i was excited over this them the boys his smile was dazzling even if he wasntshowing his teeth and beneath his thin framed glasses his eyes seemed to burn with me stood there mezmerized by him and he walked away i hadnteven the time to think of something to say because my mind was so absolutely stuck on how good looking he was and how how he scared the hell out of me he walked away looking back over his shoulder and smiling one last time me pushing myself off the wall and standing in the middle of the hall watching him watching him james potter pushing himself even further into my life when i had been the one who meant to push into their lives they weren t he wasnt supposed to to affect me like that just standing there mmm in the middle for today i guess there comes a time when all of the little people are gone from your range of view you become temporarily blinded and can only see those who are impacting your life in ways you had never known of before acquaintances become irrelevant petty problems are nothing of your concern anymore and you realize there are very few people who actually really completely matter to you it a turning point it a slap in the face a glass of cold water it everything you thought to prepare yourself for but never did you should ve known there d come a time when people who you loved would change and you d change and you d love different people i should ve known it would ve changed god i flaked out in my classes that day just sat there staring at the professor wondering why the hell they chose to waste their lives teaching a bunch of kids who most likely didntappreciate a word they said i cantsay i did hogwarts was perfect and amazing and the most unbelievable place on earth honestly but it seemed like every night of my life had been spent sitting there in that common room it was so routine why why was i suddenly so bloody uncomfortable in the only place i ve really known for going on 7 years because i realized that all of the little people meant nothing to me and i was realizing who was impacting my life in such ways and it was the strangest feeling james potter sirius black and even remus lupin they were a package you dontget one without the others and as i looked around the common room they were the only people standing out to me the only ones my eyes didnttravel over i watched them i just they were becoming to mean too much to me and i didnteven sit with them in the evening or talk to them what was this even i had more friends than i had bargained for was james crazy honestly friends are people you spend time with and these boys were acting like it was some secret secrets i found myself closing gone with the wind of which i still hadntcompleted hem and walking over to where they were sitting on the sofas and armchairs near a corner of the common room hey i smiled and made myself comfortable on the couch next to james remus sirius were sitting back in over stuffed armchairs peter was sitting at a table near the middle of the room completing his homework the sofas by the fireplace were long and big and comfortable that where i usually sat but these sofas were shorter and the back pillows were stiff and yeah i was sitting a bit close to james hello they mumbled each of them at different times sirius yawned and stretched his eyes fixed on me when i met his eyes he just smiled bored out of your mind lily evans i sure as hell am remus rolled his eyes at this and then grinned cheekily while throwing a pillow at sirius at this point peter had come along and remus was right behind sirius for some good ol torture the ugly friend james stayed sitting with me though and i had turned my body in order to face him completely crossing my legs and putting my palms flat on my thighs what was wrong earlier i asked quietly staring at the back of the couch rather then at him mmm nothing really i rose my eyes to look at him and tilted my head jaames you just looked really unhappy he smiled for some strange reason and adjusted the way he was sitting so he was facing me more as well you concerned evans i smiled catching on to whatever game he wanted to play this evening and nodded a bit i flattered i poked him in the chest which any girl would probably enjoy as much as i did you should be by this time james was sitting the same way i was cross legged and sideways on the couch and gazing at me with a smile on his face honestly though the thing you said about having more friends than i bargained for i sighed and james watched me with a serious expression on his face i know what you mean suddenly i overwhelmed with people i hardly know want to desperately know but this is insane i insane bloody insane james agreed with a quiet laugh but you know that i for some reason i was focusing intently on what he was about to say but suddenly peter jumped onto the couch and james i jumped away as remus attempted to remove the curses sirius had placed on him i sighed and then it was friday no seriously though the next day we had relatively easy classes and the day just whipped by i was sitting at dinner thinking it was lunch time lemme tell you that was a pleasant discovery the fact the day was over and it was the weekend it was cold though i finished my meal and gazed up at the ceiling it was a bit of daily thing check the weather by gazing up at the ceiling heh the magic of this place will never truly fade it was dark or getting there the sun was setting and it was just after 6 o clock the sky had been undisturbed all day just bland and grey and with the faintest trace of the sun trying to shine through the cold when june came and summer was upon you you completely forgot what it was like to be cold and what snow looked like even but the second it drops below 0 celcius and you get the first storm of the winter it just there in your mind as vivid as always the snow the frost the way the sky looks when it so cold nothing moves just everything about winter is more intricate than any other season it lasts so long i guess we enjoy summer hardly notice autumn passing us by hate spring because it so rainy but winter lasts for months 6 almost here at least and you ll never ever forget how much you hate it never but you also cantforce away those warm and fuzzies at the hopeful wishing that you encourage all throughout december hoping christmas will be good hoping a boy with pretty eyes saves you from your boring school days wish that you could spend more time outside in the snow as much as you swear you hate it in july wish there was a reason to wear that gorgeous scarf and newsboy hat you bought a n like lily was wearing in the 3rd movie when she was twirling in the picture with james wink upcoming scene wish there was a reason to go outside just to get your cheeks all flushed because you know any girl looks good with that the air is crisp crimson blush and suddenly there is one a good reason that is to look good come for a walk with me lily his voice was startling deep and pleasant there were times when it was rather gruff and even an octave too high when he was arguing with the guys but his voice sounded so damn right and warm as it spoke requesting such a dashing thing sirius had changed from his uniform as had i and was wearing a long sleeved grey fleece sweater and a white t shirt could be seen underneath his jeans were darker blue and he was wearing a brown leather jacket and a pair of gloves was dangling from one of his pockets i looked up at him from my place at the table and must ve been rather frowning because he laughed and shoved his hands deep in his pockets touching his heel to his toes waiting for me to say something oh uh i just have never seen that jacket before i gathered my muggle coat and held it in my arms staring up at him and i s pose a walk would be nice he grinned at me and put his gloves on as i put my coat on you look nice and toasty today warm i was wearing an olive green cashmere turtleneck and my hair was in a single french braid though it was rather loose and pieces hung here and there a pair of jeans and my wool coat that wasntquite knee length and was chocolate brown the inside was cream coloured as were the huge buttons and the trim around the top and bottom why thank you i felt nice and warm and toasty today it was friday for fuck sake everybody should have that warm and toasty feeling though i wouldntbe upset if i were the only one to sometimes it nice to know you re the only one feeling a particular way as soon as the blast of cold air hit us as he pulled the front door open we were walking nearer to one another it was just automatic if you ve someone warm to the left of you you just walk closer in order to revel in that warmth and well with sirius being to my left i took advantage of it do you feel as if you shouldntspeak sirius whispered as we walked along the dirt path that was currently frosty and crunching beneath our feet due to the thin layer of snow why i whispered back he turned his head and smiled at me and oh my god it was a smile that reached his eyes those grey blue eyes that were so incredibly alight with a swirling torrent of hidden emotion secret emotion secrets they hadntleft we were still living in them these past 2 days had been secrets and nothing more unfinished sentences turned into a dangling secret it so calm we were approaching the banks of the lake and stopped short not wanting to get too close to the water that wasntquite frozen over absolutely serene nothing moving i swear it i swore it too nothing moving but the frosty white breath that issued from his mouth as he spoke and became his words floating off december beautiful by now the moon had risen and the sun was gone and it felt as if it could be 10 o clock at night and not just passed 6 30 the bright white light the moon gave off hit the snow just right and it sparkled and shone and it was certainly fitting for hogwarts for it was the most magical scene anybody could ever observe the quiet before the storm the few moments when day meets night and they merge as a wonderful silent beauty and then night takes it place i swallowed somehow pulling my eyes from his gorgeous face honestly gorgeous just every little movement and looked to his hand that was at his side and not shoved in his pocket i took it i mean held it put it in my own and enjoyed it so damn much tell me a secret lily evans his voice had gone hoarse as he spoke at first but he caught himself and cleared his throat secrets are secrets for a reason i smirked slightly and adjusted my hand in his intertwining our fingers better yes they exsist only to be told so tell me one i ll tell you one first he looked out over the still lake i think you re the prettiest witch in this whole school i laughed and dammit i couldnthelp how happy i sounded sure he called me a witch but it was part of the charm hardly a secret sirius i mean i not trying to say i think everyone should know i the prettiest i mean that not much of a secret completely untrue and i shrugged i sure you could come up with something better he tipped his head back and laughed his smooth yet almost bark of a laugh i ve already told you all of the good ones the map the cloak and of course the deep dark secrets will come out later on it your turn mmm ohkay i eighteen he rolled his eyes interrupting me no lemme finish i eighteen and i felt my cheeks burn and knew i couldntsay it in an even voice while looking at him so i looked away never been kissed he made a sort of a sound in his throat as if he was trying to clear it but half gasped as he did so i smiled and shook my head turning it away from him god never been kissed i dontbelieve it there was no trace of laughter or anything in his voice it was soft and rugged and sincere honestly anybody who had the chance to kiss you and didn t is a fool james potter popped briefly into my mind but however i gave him a small smile of appreciation thank you i gave his hand a squeeze and went to let go and turn back towards the castle mmm yes i think that was enough for tonight he didntlet go though held me back and looked as if he was petrified and torn over what he was about to do i soon understood why he swallowed hard his adam apple bobbing and murmured something that i could not hear whether because he said it too quietly or i just didntwant to hear anything he said as his face moved closer i didntregister what he was about to do until i had hardly any reaction time my eyes didntgo wide but instead my lips parted and i took a deep breath he tilted his head brushing his nose against mine while he looked in my eyes one last time before closing his own he simple as anything sirius black kissed me it was as if everything that was warm in the world had gone and left us in 15 celcius degree weather and all that warmth that had left had gone to one place sirius lips my god holy jesus i honestly mean it though almost as if they were burning with anticipation and determination and passion everything about the kiss was passionate even though nothing actually was just how he approached it and how he did it and how how it felt his lips just rested on my own gently for a moment before he brought his gloved fingertips to my already burning cheek and grazed the backs of them along it as he did this i shifted my weight leaning up slightly and pressing our lips more firmly together soft little pecks gently taking my lips in his own and warming them nipping at them oh my god i had almost lost my breath before the damn kiss began and by the time his mouth was off of mine i had to take a gasp of breath he had left his hand on my cheek and when he went to pull his lips back i kissed them twice gently and felt my mouth was set in a bit of a voluptuous pout and he was intently watching me press my lips together and he licked his own slightly and i shivered when those eyes met my own with some sort of tension still left in the space between us i cantsay it was bad tension it was just intense cold sirius murmured untangling his hand from mine which had stayed clasped as we kissed and putting both of them on my arms slowly rubbing them up and down i dontknow he frowned at this but continued rubbing my arms as it was all i could do was helplessly watch him what what had just happened i mean i wasntsurprised there was no reason to be he had dropped so many damn hints that i was expecting something along those lines to happen sooner or later but it was still incredibly mind fucking because he was sirius black and some girls only dreamt of kissing him and probably enjoyed their dreams more than i found myself enjoying the actual thing that butterfly in the pit of your stomach feeling eh not so good why do people think having a bunch of creatures soaring in your stomach would feel pleasant it doesn t maybe there are some good butterfly in the stomach feelings but this one was oddly unpleasant i was so excited that my head felt as if it weight a hundred pounds and my stomach was flipping so much i thought i was to be sick how do you enjoy a feeling like that i felt selfish and guilty and sad and happy and i had no idea anymore you wanna go inside now nothing had been said for ages we just stood there absolutely freezing in silence i actually think i ll stay out a bit longer you can go in if you d like he seemed hesitant about leaving me out there and i dontthink he would ve if i hadntsounded so pathetic and looked so shaken ohkay lily and this can be our secret now if if you d like you know and he smiled and i smiled back and i wrapped my arms around myself and held my breath as long as possible trying not to disturb the state things were in a quiet peaceful relaxing one i thought though just thought a lot about the past couple of months things had changed so drastically and i was a person who had the same thing her whole life the same not really friends the same crappy parents the same bitchy persona and i dunno these boys were everything to me now because they were all i had at the moment was that bad or wrong somehow i didntthink so but sirius had confused me royally it like i wasntbeing considerate or any fair really sirius and james friendship had been so right had been the almost perfect friendship that anybody would be lucky to have and i had came prancing in just taking over and pushing things out of the way in order to earn a spot in their lives and it seemed i had earned a rather front row spot but liking sirius and wanting james so desperately bad to be my best friends and thinking remus was gorgeous the kiss being our secret i think it seemed almost best i was afraid james might think i was sabotaging the beginning of our friendship just for some kiss but it wasntjust some kiss or maybe i didntknow what i wanted and thought that in the weeks to come what i wanted would change from what i wanted now and maybe that want for james potter friendship would be something something else i was cold i was alone but i had been kissed by sirius black and it seemed only right that i take a moment out of my worrying to to properly enjoy that because hell it was certainly something to properly enjoy i just so badly didntwant to mess this up and it would help if i knew what either boy was thinking if i knew what i was thinking if i knew if sirius had enjoyed the kiss had intended for it to happen or if he was just making a joke out of my never been kissed confession pretty eyed boys with good hair and nice clothes made me so insecure abc chapter 7 something different james her eyes are green brightest damn green i ve ever seen only person i know actually who has green eyes and dontask me to describe them any further i just dontknow jade green maybe i know how to describe them for me they re lovely and bright and that probably doesntmean a lot to anyone who hasnthad the chance to gaze into them her hair firey red it wavy and fell just past her shoulders her part was never completely centered strands usually crossing this way and that and the way she d run her hand back through it just giving her this casual look of elegance her milky skin contrasted quaintly with her crimson waves of hair and her bright green eyes so wild and full of dreams contrasted with everything else her lips were pouty and were a dusty pink colour just soft and delicate and her smile was innocent and tugged at your heartstrings but her eyes was like looking at a completely different person it was the oddest feeling in the world just being around her i not sure what i was doing up just sitting in the common room at 6 am on a saturday i liked my sleep needed my sleep went through some crazy withdrawal if i didntget enough sleep which usually involved me 6 cups of coffee and forgetting loads of things so my weekends were what i lived for and i was awake in december the sun didntcompletely rise until 8 and things were still shadowy then so yeah it was rather dark though there was some light creeping in from the edges softening up the dark and bringing navy into the sky i sprawled out on the couch after having added wood to the fireplace and charmed it again it needed re charmed every morning to stay going throughout the day i was letting her in too fast she was just so sweet and persuasive i hardly knew her she she didntknow that much about me enough i suppose but when a girl says all she wants is some friends hell you cantreally help but warm up to her she was lily lily evans and that about all i needed to know right now that and when she woke up that morning she was wearing the sweatshirt she had taken from me a few nights ago that struck me as important lily warm and shaky i was warm and shaky when i woke up to a dark morning it must ve been morning early at that because i assumed i hadntslept until that evening or something normally i would just roll over and go back to sleep but there was something oddly inviting about this incompleted morning and how bloody warm i was and how my whole body would wrack with a shudder as if my nerves were on some sort of high i rubbed my eyes and quickly pulled a pair of socks on because when my feet are cold it as if all of me is cold and i wanted to enjoy this i didntlook to the clock as i walked from the dorm because maybe if i had i would not have been idiot enough to get up or maybe i would ve considered what i was wearing you feel so completely different in the morning then in the afternoon when you wake up early in the morning you just know it early for me at least i quiver and yawn a lot and there just this overwhelming sense of security and serenity i sure it was my loud breathing that alerted him of my presence otherwise i had been quiet but the almost stifling warmth of the common room made me take a deep breath and hold it and then try to catch it again it felt so nice almost like christmas morning almost for usually i was at home dreading getting out of bed to the cold wood floors i get so excited for christmas though or just the days leading up to christmas because they re the ones i spend at hogwarts christmas at home is never anything to get excited over my parents have been divorced since i was 8 i hardly recall a christmas when we were all together and happy i do remember picking out a tree with my dad and how i walked onto a frozen puddle of water and the ice cracked and i was up to my knees in cold muddy water it was so awful i never liked cutting our own trees down after that but at least my dad tried to make a deal out of christmas he used to do the decorating and he used to buy most of the presents and he used to try to calm petunia i on christmas eve making sure we knew that santa wouldntcome if we were awake and all of that and sometimes i guess it good remembering those brief childhood memories and getting that surge of excitement again december was my favourite month especially here it was the perfect christmas scene even only 2 days in to the month i wrapped my arms around myself and my back had actually began aching from the shudders i was trying to suppress it was like my breathing echoed in the large room that was overloaded with armchairs and sofas and chairs and tables and other furniture it was so cozy the sky was a dark navy and was slowly getting lighter and the fire was blazing furiously so the room danced with strange colours and james was there laying on the couch one of his arms folded behind his head and the other crossed over his stomach i tilted my head and gazed at him through rather bleary eyes james potter i swear it slept like 22 hours on a saturday and here he was he must ve been sleeping though what is it about a saturday morning that so attractive he wasntsleeping apparently though his voice was thick and he spoke slowly good question i mumbled through a yawn what time is it james flopped his arm down near his face and he peered at his watch for a few moments before deciding to read it 6 06 jesus christ almighty i rubbed at my cheeks trying to wake up and then ran my hand back through my hair combing my fingers through it that insane i ve not been up this early for ages our classes started by 9 o clock so getting up at 7 30 or 8 worked all right for me so that brings me back to my original question why up so early this morning he sat up and beckoned me to come sit next to him slowly i did so feeling his eyes so completely focused on me as i walked from behind the couch where i had been standing to sit next to him on the couch that my shirt he murmured under his breath and he wasntblinking as he looked at me i don t i dontknow why i up early i just woke up and was warm i clasped my hands together and i like being warm when i wake up thus here i am and i looked at him smiling yeah it is your sweater i mean i drew my eyes down to look at the grey sweatshirt and fiddled with the hem along the bottom keep it i ve got more clothes than a boy should have as it is i laughed hoarsely keep it no no well i shrugged actually i think i planned on it good you know most girls think that guys dontlike them wearing their clothes their sweaters girls seem to think that guys find them unattractive in baggy sweaters that fall to their knees his sweater fell just about to my knees and they think we re hesitant about letting them wear them but honestly lily spread the word it an ego boost to us guys there nothing better than having your friends ask isntthat your shirt when a beau he paused and regained whatever it had been that he lost for that moment pretty girl is wearing it well then i ohkay i half laughed having no idea where that had come from but it wasntbad having him just talk beautiful though i swore it was going to come out of his mouth he was going to say it i was wearing his shirt and i had caused an ego boost and he thought i was i was beautiful i wasntconceited i just wasn t i didntspend loads of time worrying about how i looked and i certainly didntthink i was beautiful my mum had told me early on that girls with red hair werentpretty or beautiful they were just average and to never get my hopes up over boys thinking i was something special and to this day i like to think that her saying that didnt crush me and kill me and diminish a part of me and turn me into some needy but cautious jumpy bitch i still like to think it didn t like to think it didn t like to think she didn t like to think that that she cared or something petunia was a brunette mum had light brown hair my dad hair was almost blonde and i had red hair my dad grandmum had red hair and i got it i guess the red hair some kids maybe wouldntsecond guess their bloody natural hair colour but i wasntpretty i was just average dammit lily yeah yeah sorry i was just thinking he was rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses yet kept his gaze on me mmm so we re friends lil it was suddenly apparent to me that james was a marauder it just occured to me as i gazed up at him with slightly narrowed eyes and small smile as i thought sirius was charming smooth a bit obnoxious handsome and arrogant remus held the same qualities charming and suave and handsome and smooth and i sure he could even hold an air of arrogance at times i guess it made sense that they were alike remus may have been a bit quieter yet a bit more vocal with his insight and sirius may have been a bit more boisterous but he could be just as insightful i sure of it and until this morning i never i guess i never realized how james was like them two it just never stood out at me before it never was there in my face the fact that he was a marauder and they were all best friends and it was just the way he was looking at me just then his face was stubbly as he was unshaven and his eyes seemed so smoldering and dark they seemed rather lidded like he was having a time keeping them open and there were circles beneath them it just made him look like the other two dark circles because they didntsleep near as much as james did he wore a pair of loose navy sweat pants and a white fitted t shirt his voice was hoarse kind of scratchy on certain things he d say and he was saying things for christ sake it was a lot to ask to have a conversation with james and his adam apple seemed to just draw attention to itself the way it bobbed when he swallowed or smiled he was suddenly and completely very male not a man because he was a boy sirius was a boy remus was a boy every guy is a boy until the day they die because that the day they ve earned the right to be called a man until then they re just boys naive stubborn pretty sweet boys but he was the definition of male right now incredibly masculine even the way the shadows danced in the corners of his features i swallowed and blinked a few times my gaze unfocused james i smiled yes we re friends it insane i hardly know you but just ca that not bloody necessary i interrupted shortly he smiled at me gently i just meant ohkay never mind it but yeah friends there was some admitted defeat in his voice and yeah i felt it too understood why he would be admitting defeat by saying those words it just this morning it felt like we were in some dramatic romance novel james potter i sitting there realizing we were friends and i wanted him to be my best friend and sirius had kissed me and james was wearing a bloody white fitted t shirt and we both liked to sleep but were up early and it was just like we were surrendering to friends we could ve been long lost lovers had things been different and different people exchanged kisses and had sirius black not been so damn appealing soul mates lovers just anything that would have connected us at the soul we could have been but werentgoing to be friends we were friends and as disappointed as most may be over it i wanted it so so much friends lovers and soul mates are connected at the soul but little did i know at the time so are best friends especially ones with a friendship that goes to hell and back again thank you james for being my friend you ve no reason at all to let me in he stood for some reason and had a clenched jaw as he looked down at me i thought he was angry for a moment but then heh one of his index fingers jumped to his right cheek and he rubbed it just beneath his glasses after doing that he rubbed the back of his neck and then rumpled his hair you re welcome that ridculous actually you don t have to thank me i should thank well just jesus christ just he waved the unfinished modest statement aside and started new you know that welcome winter bonfire thing tonight he raised a single eyebrow he could only do that at certain times i cam to find and looked at me questioningly oh right i forgot we could go to that this year yeah what about it it was this tradition i guess for the 7th years there was always this big bonfire that was warm warm warm down near hagrid the groundkeeper s cabin earlier in the evening there was ice skating on the lake and there were warm blankets and hot cocoa and friends talking and boys bonding and sometimes a couple of professors would come down to check on things but it was just a big get together that reminded us that yeah this is it 7th year final year are you goin to it he seemed so casual yet he insisted on rubbing his cheek and kinda jiggling his foot they his nervous habits drove you absolutely mad but hmm i dunno later i realized that those bloody habits of his helped him through things made him who he was they were friggin adorable honestly well now that i ve remembered it i ll probably go i scrunched my nose and laughed as i stood up too it sounds cute james grinned and went to shove his hands in his pockets which there werentany of in the sweat pants i couldnthelp but laugh he shook his head and chuckled too it was another security thing for him knowing he could hide his hands in his pockets hide some of him from people i going too i guess ah you and the marauders going to be wreacking havoc mmm he looked away from me and focused on the end of the couch well there some thing going on in hogsmeade at the three broomsticks i guess they think they can get their hands on some alcohol so james grinned lopsidedly and oh he looked so cute and young his messed up hair and devilish grin i ve never seen him grin so good naturedly but wait the chance to go to hogsmeade for everyone would be distracted and the professors wouldnteven notice four missing boys one who had an invisibility cloak hit on madame rosmerta gah seriously sirius has a thing for flirting with older women even if she not that much older and get alcohol why the hell was he passing this one up so if you wanna go together or whatever cause i wonthave anybody to hang out with and your friends his cheeks grew a bit red and he cleared his throat and you may not have anybody to hang out with so if you wanna go together and hang out together that d be nice oh i dontknow if he knew and i dontknow if i even knew what it was that i dontknow if he knew i just my head felt light and swarmed and the whole room to a lurch and seemed brighter and just he wanted to go with me it was just the most incredible thing in the world for him to ask me to go to want to spend time with me james potter introvert extraordinaire asked me to hang out with him hell i had sit down he reached out and held a hand onto my shoulder as i sunk back to the couch i d love to and then those smoldering dark hazel green eyes looked to me with a warm sweet melting gaze and he was so very there at 12 after 6 in the morning hey hi lily her name was bridget harris she was the prettiest girl i know and was in gryffindor and in 7th year too most girls dontlike admitting other girls are that pretty but with bridget it was more of a fact i thought jada was pretty enough but it not like i d tell her that she was too mean to be completely pretty bridget hair was so dark that it was almost black it was long and silky and shiny her hair was that of the models you see on shampoo or hair dye commercials absolutely perfect looking not a split end in sight her bangs were a bit too long and hung in her eyes so she usually swept them to the side her smile was perfect and she had deep brown eyes and she was always so happy i could ve been friends with her i supposed had i tried maybe hey bridget i smiled at her as we made our back to gryffindor tower we had just ate supper it was 5 o clock early due to the activities this evening and she had came bounding up to me in the corridor are you going to the bonfire tonight she asked and i noticed just how bloody bouncy and chipper she was it was rather contagious as i started walking the same fast pace she was walking at yeah i am i grinned at her and she let out some sort of giggly squeal ray taking me she shrugged and flipped her hair behind her ear whatever taking me means a casual date i guess ray was a boyish good looking guy in our year in ravenclaw and i think her and ray were in an on off relationship a casual date i murmured a certain messy haired hazel eyed boy jumping to mind yeah i dunno should be fun you going with anybody well it not like i would be lying because i was going with somebody mmm i grinned james potter her eyes widened and she smiled rather mischeviously you lucky wench donttell ray i said that i laughed a girlish laugh that i found myself doing more often but absolutely hated it anyways since you re head girl i thought maybe you might know if i was allowed to take a camera she furrowed her eyebrows oh well yeah i suppose you can take one why not right will it work she nodded yeah i bought it in hogsmeade magical one that awesome yeah bring it pictures of frolicking couples aw i scrunched my nose up and she laughed at me i ll be sure to get some pictures of a certain red raven haired frolicking couple she grinned at me spotted a friend of hers ahead of us and bounded down the hall waving see you later bye we were practically to gryffindor tower anyways and the corridor had pretty much cleared out i was walking slowly humming to myself and looking to the portraits hanging all over the walls almost as if from the shadows emerged sirius black aw ickle lily making friends he smirked at me and i shoved him playfully shut up he grinned further now now no way for a young lady to talk i laughed and rolled my eyes i ve decided you could get on my nerves sirius blinked and then shrugged trying not to crack a grin well i s pose that that then we re through i shrugged too and we both stopped walking as we came to the portrait hole too bad i made a tutting sound i never loved you as it is he raised his eyebrows until they almost disappeared under his fringe and took a step closer to me clutching a hand to his chest that one hurt i grinned and his arms came around my waist pulling me a bit closer i looked up into his eyes and tilted my head as he went serious what re you doing tonight um mmm going to the bonfire thing oh pish typical girl i laughed and circled my arms around his neck i suppose you wouldntwant to come to hogsmeade with remus peter and i for some drinks at the three broomsticks i snorted and he chuckled at i suppose how graceful that was no thanks he seemed to know the answer before he asked as he ignored me and leaned down i smiled as he shut his eyes and went to shut mine too until a couple of familiar voices could be heard approaching the portrait hole from down the corridor my eyes flew wide and i decided to peck him on the cheek before saying the password and clambering inside of the common room just as it swung shut i heard remus greeting sirius and james greeting him a second later it took me a good 20 minutes to get over the feel of sirius black that close to me no that a lie i never got over the feel of him it just amazed me how bloody warm he was so so warm his arms around my waist and his face that close to my own the first time he kissed me i hadntthe time to enjoy it properly it was freezing out and his lips may have been warm but he didnttouch me anywhere except for my cheek it was some incredible realization that boys were warm and their arms knew where to go around you and girls are supposed to be shorter than boys because your head is just level with his chest and he has to bend down to kiss you properly bringing you even further into his warmth and i was making myself light headed just thinking of it with sirius i wanted to talk to him and get to know him better but there was this undeniable bloody attraction and it just made it hard to think around him why was he so handsome gorgeous even his smile was like it was just for me and me alone and his eyes were so innocent and they danced with light but it like he knew things and he planned things and he wanted to say things but why bother when you had eyes like that i obsessed i know over small little unimportant things hell james called me lil earlier today whilst asking whether or not we were friends and my heart just pounded and god it sounded so pretty yes my point i obsess over small things i need detail and when a boy is warm and warm near me and i dontknow i ve just never had a boyfriend before sirius was the closest thing i had ever had james was the closest thing i had ever had they were my fucking friends and they were making me think of them being my fucking boyfriends plural boyfriend s i couldn t do that i couldntwant more with both of them it was 6 o clock when people were leaving the common room all bundled up and looking bright i was sitting there in casual clothes no coat or gloves or hat i hadntmoved since i sat down and i didntfeel i could all right sirius came to stand in front of the couch i was sitting on wearing that brown leather jacket a pair of gloves and he was holding a black toque in his hand i will see you later lily evans i was biting my lip and smiled the best i could with my teeth still tugging at the dry skin he frowned at me you ve gone and made it bleed i wiped the small amount of blood off on the back of my hand and made a face i hate how they get dry and crack in the winter i murmured standing up and then looking to him be good he grinned and put a hand on my cheek though didntlean in like i thought he would sorry for earlier i felt as if i startled you i shook my head at this no i just james and remus were coming and i didntknow if that would be uncomfortable or not sirius nodded yeah no i understand it ohkay he kissed his fingertips and then brushed them along my cheek dammit i wish he would hold me closer again you be good too ta then he went and joined remus peter in discussing their plans near the portrait hole my gaze had hardly pulled away from sirius when james got up from the table he was sitting at and came over to the couch you wanna go now i noted he looked less than ready as well most people that were going had already left yeah sure i ll go get changed super quickly i promise i flashed him a smile and dashed up the girls staircase just catching the two boys glance at each other and offer tight lipped smiles with no eye contact why was this so awful but so pleasantly enjoyable when i came back down to the common room james was just pulling his gloves on and was wearing his winter coat i had put on a pair of dark rinse jeans a dark emerald green turtleneck and my winter coat i grabbed my adorable newsboy hat a pair of gloves and ran my hands pack through my hair quickly putting some lip gloss on i loved turtlenecks just the obvious warmth and coziness they represented i didntlike ones that nearly choked you so i was wearing one that had a rather droopy neck the common room had few people in it but him and i were the only 7th years left hanging around here i am he looked up from adjusting his gloves and something something flickered behind his eyes and then ignited you look absolutely lovely he took the hat from my hands and then put it on my head still gripping it with both hands and grinning at me his eyes sharing with mine it was the most surprising thing yet that day he grinned with his pearly whites showing and i had never seen him look more grown up and strong and aware but playful and it was nice i couldnthelp but grin what gotten into you mmm i like your hat james tugged on it one last time swung his scarf around his neck and then strode off towards the portrait hole c mon it was a crisp clear night around 6 30 and so it wasnt completely dark but was getting there it was at that point where there was enough light left to see who was next to you but it was straining on your eyes the navy black light thing to the sky some people have night blindness though i think i one of them the stars shone so bloody bright tonight and i walked on the right as we went down the stairs out into the night the path down to the bonfire was lit with torches and the flames seemed to be the only thing about the night that was moving the air was so very still and i found this was something of routine at hogwarts for the first few days of december apparently every aspect of nature seemed to hold it breath and let it ease in everybody seemed to abandon the idea of skating after dark and i seen the large group of people down by the bonfire it was huge but wasntroaring or anything it crackled nicely as if it was small fire in a hearth i loved watching people by firelight though and this was just right james i stopped walking near the end of the path and i looked around the little gathering that was going on there were three huge logs laying in different directions near the fire so you could sit on them a table near hargid hut was loaded with mugs they were empty but once you picked them up they would magically fill with whatever you wanted and keep refilling when you were nearing the bottom a pile of blankets was lay at the end of one of the logs and i seen professor mcgonagall tapping her wand to them and then turning round to head back up the path she of course ran into us as we were just standing there oh miss evans mr potter good to see you here the blankets are charmed and are warm wouldntwant anybody getting frostbite i sure you two only need one blanket though her thin lips were set in i guess what she thought was a smile i frowned one what do you oh my cheeks burned and i looked away from the professor as james kicked at the snow it not like that professor he said quietly she bade us good evening and was on her way i continued walking over to the logs and crossed my arms staring at the fire and feeling it warmth suddenly engulf me wow that incredible james muttered coming to stand next to me and holding the palms of his hands out near the fire as if to confirm the heat it is i breathed deeply and let my eyes follow the flames upwards until i saw just the smoke floating towards the sky i love the smell of bonfires burning wood oh me too well he shrugged and smiled at me when our eyes met i ve never actually been to a bonfire of any sorts but i like the smell of a match burning so this is just like a match burning times a lot i shook my head laughing quietly sure thing james he shrugged and looked around at everybody talking and laughing and i saw bridget snapping pictures of hagrid cabin and bit my lip as she saw me she waved furiously and came over to where we were her feet crunching into the snow eee hi i loving this she grinned at me it is nice isntit it peaceful despite the chatter bridget however wasnthearing me she was looking at james with a wide smile on her face that lit up her pretty features more than the firelight did how about a picture she asked rather excitedly james raised his eyebrows and then looked to me shrugging i s pose he grinned looked back to bridget and we just stood there facing the camera she lowered the camera from her face and frowned though giggled slightly enthusiastic bunch i laughed and put a hand to my face i just didntknow what to do i didntknow how james felt about i dun know anything c mere james tugged on my gloved hand and pulled me close he took one of my hands in his and then put one of his arms own around my back holding me to him bridget grinned and i laughed as james spun me around half dancing half spinning me she snapped the picture and then with a flourish he twirled me one last time and let me go that was a good one i ll see you later all right see you bridget i said through gasps of laughter i took a deep breath and sat down on the log looking up at james you re different tonight james potter you re happy tonight lily evans touch he grinned at me and i laughed shaking my head as ray bridget ravenclaw boyfriend who played qudditch too spotted james and came over and began talking with him i got up and went over to talk to bridget who was stuffing her small camera in her coat pocket hey she looked at me and looked serious or even pensive for a moment he a good guy lily it took me by surprise the impression james and i were giving off he is yeah both of our gazes turned to where the two boys were stood and i sighed not tearing my gaze away though i knew bridget had he just looked so nice and it almost made me sad or wistful or happy it made me so many things i know i was so so close to having him exclusively for me i know that i felt something for sirius i know that james would fight me tooth and nail on letting me in and i was wistful because i was so jealous of the people in his life who had always known him and had always been there for him i wanted to be there so badly it was funny how boys can act like men and boys can act like well boys they acted like men tonight ray was talking amiably gesturing with his hands a lot and james had one of his hands shoved deep into the pocket of his cordroy pants and the other wasntin his pocket he d rub above his upper lip and nod and then flail his hand out to the side when he was making a point or interrupting or elaborating or whatever his messy hair shadowed his face in the slightest but when he d shake it from his eyes you could see every detail of his face he had a slight dimple in his left cheek and when he laughed it protruded more he had a nice nose i decided you see people on television complaining about their awful noses and then the doctors fix them but i dontknow anybody with an ugly nose like that i loved his shoulders loved how he shrugged them loved how he d crick his neck and then square his shoulders i loved how they were broad and gave the impression of impending power because he was strong and powerful and sometimes i wished he could hold the whole world particularly mine in the palm of his hand because he could make it so right but yeah someday we d see that his strength lilllyyy i blinked and looked at bridget shaking my head in spite of myself my god i just i dunno that embarrassing he your boyfriend you have every right to stare she laughed lightly and rubbed her hands together oh god um you see no james i are just friends and i mean that so honestly we re just we re just friends i dontthink she said anything i wasntsure she might ve but i was sure she knew to wait until i was looking at her again to say anything to me because i had looked back to james and he met my gaze tilting his head he gave me a small yet incredibly handsome smile and waved shortly i smiled moved my eyes away for a second then looked back into his hazel ones and even though he was stood a good distance away i could feel how they penetrated me i sighed and slumped down on the nearest log you look at him so differently though bridget sat down next to me and we huddled close together this log was closer to the forest and was in the shadows cast by the tall trees making it chillier like you admire him with every ounce of you i do i muttered though more to myself than to her i did admire him everything about him and i hated it so so so much for some aspects of james potter werentworthy of being admired but other aspects of him should be written down and examined carefully and declared perfect the marauders just were all something different james was a gorgeous mystery sirius was dark and handsome remus was golden and handsome pretty i hadntlooked away from him for minutes and i didntcare that he knew i was practically memorizing the way he looked so enticing and detailed and i couldntfinish my thoughts because the next thing i knew he was standing at the end of the log i was sitting on and tilting his head to look at me let go get you some hot cocoa it what we do drink hot cocoa and sit by fires i got up from the log leaving the shade of the trees and following after james we went to the table set up with mugs and james picked two up handing me one and it instantly filled with hot cocoa mmm i murmured in a satisfied sort of way holding the mug with both of my hands yeah i love this me too james sipped his drink and held it with one hand turning to look as someone called his name i turned too and seen another gryffindor 7th year coming towards him you re quite popular mr potter he chuckled for a moment before greeting the guy dave heey dave said putting his hands in the pockets of his jacket and looking around before looking back to james asked him how his year was going how his parents were blah blah blah i wasnttoo concerned of what dave whats his name was saying because james had put his arm around my shoulders letting me lean against his side as he talked and i drank the cocoa he was looking at dave as he did it and it happened so elegantly and quickly that i nearly missed it i was standing next to him kind of awkwardly and he seemed to sense that or something he looked quickly to me nodding at something dave said and i bit my lip his arm just seemed to reach out on it own accord and go around my shoulders giving me a gentle tug nearer to his body and his undeniable radiating warmth it was him starting to prove that strength him draping an arm around me holding me gently yet protectively i could think of nothing else but him and it sort of worried me by the third time james had looked sideways at me and smiled dave grinned slowly and seemed to spot someone he had been looking for catch you later potter he clapped him on the back as he walked by and james arm was still very much around me as he just seemed to lead me over closer to the fire by instinct you look absolutely frozen james said somewhere quite near my hair and i leaned my head further into his shoulder as we sat down and he grabbed a blanket from the diminishing pile at the end of the log he wrapped it mostly around me up to my neck first taking the half empty mug from my hands it fell over his legs though and he seemed perfectly comfortable i not i warm honestly i could hardly speak though because with the mixture of cold awakening air and the warmth from the fire and the warmth from the blanket and the warmth from him i was overwhelmed and dizzy with good feelings james said nothing and i felt one of his hands brush through my hair as we sat there my face was buried away somewhere between his shoulder and chest and he smelled so nice not overwhelmingly so but something like fading cologne and just everything nice about the outdoors i stared at the fire and had i been looking at james i would have seen his eyes were still alight with whatever had ignited in them earlier and he was scanning through the people though staying with me you are warm he said to me eventually his lips i could feel pressed against my hair at the top of my head as he spoke only because you are a yawn was threatening but dammit i just wanted to sit here heh i could feel him smile and he shifted his arm around me running his gloved fingers up and down my upper arm more people had began to sit down on the logs and i snuggled closer to james meeting bridget eyes briefly and exchanging a grin i usually hate any sort of gathering with a passion but i interrupted him and finished for him you re different tonight that i am he sighed and craned his neck so he could look upwards yeah i gazed up at him as he looked back down and i seen everything about that night reflected in his eyes he was right i was happy and the sky was so bright when your birthday james i noticed my voice had gotten rough or something and i cleared my throat picking my mug back up from the ground with one hand and taking a sip my birthday he raised his eyebrows and seemed to contemplate it as if he had forgotten i didntexpect him to tell me december 21st there was something about him just telling me his birthday i had asked before i had assumed him to tell me before around the time that it was my birthday but he hadn t but i asked tonight when i was happy and he was different and he told me and it was different tonight was different altogether james was making me dizzy with good feelings and sirius was acting all romanticly involved with me and bridget bridget could be my friend maybe i fell asleep leaning against his shoulder after ages and ages of just sitting there and listening to him talk to guys and sometimes me and listen to rather tipsy sounding girls sing songs and eventually i yawned so loudly he looked me oddly and asked if he was boring me i half laughed and just shook my head whispering something of how he made everything so warm it drove me insane with drowsiness and i shut my eyes breathing him in and just being calmed so much that i dozed off i briefly remembered waking up and stumbling up the path to the castle with him holding on to me tightly murmuring something i cantquite recall but it was sweet we had gone up to floors and as we approached a third staircase i moaned something about wanting to sit down and rest james had enough of seeing how helples i was i guess because he sighed grinned at me and lifted me into his arms and i fell back to sleep again 12 21 his alarm clock wasntdigital but the numbers and the hands glowed in the dark so i could tell the time from where i was laying 12 21 the hangings were open and the clock set on the night table and it was 12 21 and james birthday was december 21st 12 21 then it became apparent to me james clock james clocks hands glowed in the dark james hangings were open james bed i blinked roughly and let my eyes adjust to the dark seeking out mr potter himself james i said croakily seeing his head resting on the end bed and his arms sprawled out on it as well wake up james i nudged him with my foot and he bolted up rubbing his eyes and adjusting his glasses i lay back down pulling the comforter up to my neck and thoroughly enjoying the fact that james pillow smelled so fucking good i could faintly see him smiling at me as he crawled towards the top of the bed he rested his head on the bed again and i moved my face closer to his smiling and holding onto the covers with both of my hands hi i whispered smiling at him and loving just how close his face was i could see everything about him and i wouldntmind sleeping next to this every night hi he whispered back smiling too and rubbing his thumb along my cheek sleep well mmm oh i squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head the best i could sorry not at all i had a good time thank you i smiled as he said this but it was one of those sad you dont need to thank me ones almost a sad or sincere one it was good to see you hanging out with bridget i worry about you lily evans that struck a chord with me he worried about me and i just positively wanted to burst into tears but all the same it was sweet i yawned and turned my face away from his laying on my back realizing i was rather acting posessive of his bed bridget she nice really pretty i absolutely jealous we both heard the knob of the door turning as if somebody was struggling in the dark to turn it the right way it would be the other three marauders i wasntreally concerned of what they d think james was incredible tonight and the sky and everything had been in his hazel green eyes and i hadntkissed sirius properly that day and i realized i hadntactually looked at james lips oh fuck i bet they were wonderful wonderful you have no reason to be jealous you re beautiful and he had said it the door opened and james thought i was beautiful as sirius first came in abc chapter 8 miserable sex i had told james on november 12th my birthday of sirius confusing me horribly i told him that he held my hand and i told him that he had put his own on my knee i realized as sirius walked in the dorm that james hadntsaid much of it hadntquestioned whether i liked sirius or whether sirius liked me and he hadntasked if the two of us were persuing a relationship or something and it was like sirius wanted to keep whatever we were doing a secret ever since the kiss i ve been whole heartedly agreeing with that unspoken bid to keep any romantic interest between us from james but as well i was keeping james i from sirius because well i didntknow what we were doing either plus he was so incredibly mine at times and i didntwant that ruined but none of that was now for right now there was me lay in james bed positively sinking into the soft matress and the warmth of the down filled comforter and there was sirius black james you should ve been there as soon as he got the door open he began talking putting the light out on his wand and shoving it back into his pocket peter drank too much he rolled his eyes at remus as james quickly stood up from where he had been sitting on the floor and we had to take him to the hospital wing madam pomfrey knew he had been drinking so she called up professor mcgonagall and now he has to stay in the hospital wing over night throwing up like mad urgh yeah that the punishment mcgonagall gave him madam pomfrey cantgive him anything to make him feel better ah it great he got detention for two weeks too sirius had tossed his jacket and hat off talked quickly to james and then had thrown himself down on his bed laying on his back with his arms stretched out behind his head remus however had stayed standing near the foot of james bed not moving an inch as sirius had spoke james too stood next to his bed in the same spot he had been sitting in since i had been covered from chin to toe my head was all that was visible and i noticed it was quite convenient that where james was stood kept my head out of sirius view the hangings were halfway drew so he couldntsee my form beneath the blankets and my jacket and things had been left downstairs in the common room sirius seemed to be staring at remus through the dark room humor in his voice as he continued to tell the story of their night thinking remus would laugh and agree to what he was saying but remus lupin would just nod from time to time not even looking at sirius because remus lupin had noticed me laying there in james bed and he was staring intently at me trying to talk to me without saying a word widening his eyes and making subtle gestures to sirius it like both him and james thought or subconciously knew that sirius may be upset over me in james bed i didntunderstand why because i didntthink either of them knew of the kiss because i was sure james would ve mentioned it to me and sirius had told me it d be our secret sirius stopped talking after a few minutes realizing james had said nothing what the hell guys he asked frowning and sitting up i heard remus start cursing quietly a few times in french and then james began laughing like a maniac loudly roaring and slapping his knee and saying things like ah peter such a dunce get up get up get up remus muttered to me and i could hardly hear him over james laughter that was the point though remus pulled something from off the top of james trunk hurrying over to me as i started sitting up and throwing it over me ah shoot heh james wiped his eyes a minute later and sirius looked at him as if he was insane wellll i forgot something in the common room remus had put james invisibility cloak over me and was speaking loudly as i stumbled over some things strewn on the floor yes the boys worked well under pressure insert sarcasm there be right back he pulled the door open and just as the cloak slipped revealing my head remus pushed me out through the doorway i heard james begin to ask sirius questions of the evening making up for the lack of enthusiasm shown a moment earlier why were what listen remus wasntbeing at all gentle he shoved me down on a couch the common room was empty and tugged the cloak off of me remember a few days ago when i told you that sirius nor james had discussed you in much depth right i nodded folding my arms and pouted in a childish way i didntdo anything wrong i dontknow why he was being aggressive towards me well that changed and you know how i also said i d make sure the two of them never did anything to take the smile from your face yes i remember what your point i sighed exasperatedly it was so very late and being outdoors for so long had gone to my head and made me tired my grandmother always said that the way to get the best sleep of your life spend the day outside and you ll sleep like a baby no lily listen to me please look at me i had looked away from him focusing on the floor but there was some desperation in his voice as if he were suffocating under the weight of whatever it was he had to tell me that drew my eyes back to his and i held his gaze as he sat down on the couch next to me he ran a hand through his hair causing his fringe to stick up and he sighed heavily i was starving to hear what he had to say now even if it was a bit irritating feeling as if i had done something it must ve been insanely intense or something because i had never seen remus like this i had never heard him sigh heavily because everything about him was the opposite of heavy usually his features werentheavy with dark circles or premature wrinkles his eyes werentheavy with a burden it was a bit of a cruel wake though with his fringe sticking up i could see that everything i just thought was a lie he was contradicting at this moment everything i had previously seen there were circles beneath his eyes and lines lay within the dark circles he d rub a hand over his face and each time he did so he looked more exhausted a realization hit me that yeah there were going to be things i d find out about the marauders that i wouldntexpect i tilted my head and studied him as he sprawled out further stretching his legs out and slumping down on the couch that divine glow he had to him was that much more divine when he was sat next to a glowing hearth the firelight did him good his hair was so unnatural it was natural i mean it just not common the way it was thick and straight yet the ends at the back of his head curled and the colour was some golden blonde but it was brown too i didn t i didntknow how to describe remus and it drove me mad ohkay right i sorry i listening and i was watching him listening to him considering him the two of em they make you happy yeah that why i said i d make sure they never took the smile from your face and yada yada yada but lils i smiled at that i d never been called it before i dontknow why you were in james bed and hell i sure it wasntsex or anything like that if it was he must be pretty miserable because you dontlook like you ve just had sex but yeah you could you could live without them i mean be fine without them i just not sure whether or not they d be fine without you i think i going back on my word and saying i going to ensure that you never take the smile off of sirius face both of them donthurt either of em ohkay but especially sirius james yeah he can be pretty cold hearted and he can get upset and all of that but if you hurt sirius he sighed again and rubbed his face frowning as he tried to figure what to say if remus lupin wasntan experienced with alcohol 17 year old boy he d be drunk i realized with a smile if you hurt sirius he repeated carefully in his rather husky voice you ll end up hurt too because he wontbe hurt does that make sense not much i mean you wontget a reaction out of him he cool and casual he may get angry at you or anybody but he wontbe hurt over what somebody does sorry for using you as an example as if you ll hurt him for certain or something i not saying you will i just cantthink what angry wasntbeing hurt yes it was when you get angry it for a reason you re hurt you re upset you re mad so you re angry but remus isntangry hurt too he offered me a nod as if he knew what i had been thinking of for most people you get to know sirius a bit better and tell me if he hurt when he angry and he was right i d come to find when sirius was angry he was furious horrbile and relentless when sirius was hurt he was he was just miserable and when he was miserable he wasntsad he was so angry no he was beyond angry so beyond angry that he could do nothing but breathe and have sex miserable sex and it was apparent to me that remus had never seen sirius miserable hurt whatever and it wasntso much that he was trying to convince me that sirius would never be hurt it was more of him trying to convince himself sirius was like rock to people to the marauders he was the rock of the marauders peter was some kind of pansy ass that had cried much too much for a boy james was strong and like sirius but had his scars to show and had been hurt remus had been hurt the most of him i blinked pulling myself out of my thoughts and looking sharply to remus his eyes i will consistently describe as stormy blue and they were certainly stormy tonight they re lucky to have you care so much the two of them are really lucky anybody would be to have you be a prying asshole i smiled you re a prying asshole i wouldntmind having around well that good because i much too involved now and then he smiled his smile was intoxicating much like he was intoxicat ed and i wondered why he didnthave a girlfriend or boyfriend honestly when it came to boys as handsome pretty as remus you just wish he gay especially when you canthave him for yourself i didnthave any feelings for remus i could confidently confirm that that about the only thing i could figure out at the moment but just because i didntlike him didntmean i would object to throwing him down and obliging to doing ungodly acts and just because i didntlike him didntmean i wanted other girls throwing him down and having their way with him god girls were awful and would ruin his undeniable charm and pretty features but he wasntgay and girls would be horrible and would ruin him but you wouldntknow he was ruined he was pretty good at looking perfect all of the time despite everything and i hugged him wrapped my arms about his neck loosely draping them and pulling him close to me i hadnthugged james for we were just friends and that was a bit too intimate for us at least kisses on the cheek holding hands and him putting an arm around me was not too intimate however i hadnthugged sirius for we seemed to just skip that stage so hugging remus was some foreign thing i had only ever hugged my parents and other relatives before and it certainly wasntlike this he wasntas warm as sirius he was still wearing his winter clothing up til a minute ago and his hands were absolutely freezing and the ends of his hair were wet from where the snow had fallen onto it because his hat didntcover them the wet just made his hair curl more but he smelled of some kind of sweet liqour and chocolatey mint which whole heartedly made up for his lack of heat and it made me feel something sort of needed or wanted sharing my warmth with this boy it was a second before his arms came together around my lower back but when he hugged me back he hugged me back well he rested his head on my shoulder and i could tell he was groggy with the effects the alcohol was having on him and randomness was a thing of beauty from a good as drunk boy did james tell you his birthday yet he muttered thickly taking a deep breath mmm december 21st i felt him nod against my shoulder pressing his forehead deeper into it and his breathing was slow and steady you ve got him you realize so bad he doesnttell anyone i was so lost that night overwhelmed was a better word so wonderfully over whelmed and afraid to admit such feeling but be here two words i had once muttered praying someone would just be here and now people were being here and i was in so deep so so lovely deep and needed maybe i was needed maybe this would all work out in the end sunday december 17th i hate my uterus honestly honestly do so much i was lay on my stomach on my bed in the girls dorm not a place i spent much of my time but i had hardly moved all day i swore this monthly should ve been over a couple of days ago but urgh of course not so here i lay two weeks had passed since the bonfire night two weeks had passed without much incident at all james and i were i dontknow actually he had been sleeping a lot more these past two weeks and i hadnttalked to him other than in classes but we were all right sirius hadn t found out that i was in james bed that night which sounds awful out of context i dontthink he had found out at least there were no signs to say he had i wouldntcare if he found out it wasntanything much it not as if there was some looming tension between us because i felt uncomfortable i didnt feel uncomfortable and he hadntkissed me again or held me close he had been talking quietly with me during the evenings and sometimes absently playing with my fingers but dammit i wanted him to kiss me again so i could remember i dontknow how it felt and why it felt like it had in the midst of thinking of sirius kiss the door opened and in came bridget i sighed and she looked to me and smiled before heading over to her bed are you not feeling well she asked and i groaned and muttered no feel like you have the flu not feeling well because of a certain time of month not feeling well over some certain bo oys she spoke in a sing song and then came to sit on the edge of my bed option number two i sighed and turned over to my side clutching my stomach tightly trying to move as little as possible here she had gone over to her nightstand and found a pill bottle she handed me a pill and i dry swallowed it you ll feel better soon and now that we re on the subject of certain boys despite how uncomfortable i was feeling i grinned bridget i had been hanging out a bit more lately easing into a friendship of sorts maybe i wasntgood at it though so it hadntgone much further than exchanging homework answers talking about what a typical guy ray was and berating jada morgan it was good to know i wasntthe only one who hated my once best friend but those two boys hadntbeen brought up bridget wasntstupid and knew there was something going on but perhaps found it best to not bring them up until now what is going on with sirius and james for that matter hell if i knew i d let you know she crossed her legs and made herself comfortable staring at me intently which one are you in love with she grinned and i laughed lightly neither sirius i have well it had been our secret kissed yeah we kissed and james i are just friends he suffocatingly intriguing bridget raised a thin perfectly arched eyebrow those are some intense words for just friends she said it in a tone that made me feel somewhat guilty for whatever reason i sighed and thought of it i couldntthink of how else to say it i know but that just how it is are you and sirius together then i realized as bridget fired off her questions i knew so little about boys and relationships no she gave me a smile and stood up good luck lily she offered a small laugh and told me she d see me later december 18th it was a monday and i was in just a spiffing mood as i threw open my text book in transfiguration class second class of the morning potions had been first i hadntgot out of bed all day sunday and so looked like hell and was stiff from being in bed so long i was finally relieved of that time of the month and i was seriously wondering why i had a uterus sure i liked kids sort of to an extent but i didntwant any i always began questioning the laws of the universe after a cycle why didnt men have uterus s and bear children morning lily psht way to hardly send me a glance all throughout breakfast and decide to talk to me during class lo james i muttered concentrating on scribbling down the homework i hadntcompleted over the weekend i had bridget answers i half raised my eyes up from the parchment to see him standing at the front of my desk and looking at me with a bit of a smirk on all right was all he said softly before taking his own seat i have rather wavy hair but today my hair was frizzy and poofy and what the hell right bad hair days should be an excuse to stay off school i was in a bad mood and didnt want to be in a good mood christmas break started on wednesday tuesday was our last day and if you were going home for break then tuesday night was when you caught your train january 4thwas when we went back or in my case january 4thth was when classes started again i d be staying at hogwarts as usual i ve been staying for holidays since 4th year when my mum stopped caring and my dad found a new girlfriend my mum goes over to america to her sisters place for christmas i could go i guess but i feel like such an inconvenience especially to my mum and my dad i just didntwant to be part of his new family him rebecca had been together for going on 4 years so they were bound to get married or something right rebecca had a son a year old than me he was good looking i didntwant to create complications there wanting to shag my potential step brother so i stayed away i guess i kind of the definition of dysfunction or sometime in the years to come sirius black told me i was i know right sirius black telling me i was the definition of dysfunction i think he was joking or maybe he wasntjoking when he said it to me and just never remembered his family and the problems they were and had because the potters were his family so it made sense i guess my mum sucked which may be obvious by now my sister was a bitch my dad was the only decent one and he was rightfully so moving on with his life while his youngest daughter was off at hogwarts learning how to be a witch i wish i was learning how to be a bitch though honestly maybe if i had been a bitch my sister would ve backed off and not pulled my hair as much and maybe if i had been a bitch more like my mum and petunia my mum would ve told me i was pretty james potter mother was 52 and his dad was the same age give or take a few months i had not met james parents before but i did know that his dad was some brilliant wizard and very valuable to the ministry of magic woo hoo pureblooded wizarding family with a grandfather that had been minister of magic not much of a surprise they were bloody rich and i didntknow much else but even though i assumed them to be maybe conceited and snobby i wished my parents would be like his he d talk of his mum from time to time and sounded like he absolutely adored her maybe if my parents were older it would ve oh right my mum was 17 when she had my sister her and my dad married when mum was 7 months pregnant and 2 years later i was born what 19 why would she want another baby when she was stupid enough to have her first one i guess because they didntreally need to worry my dad took over my grandfather company car company and was pretty well off for a teenager so yeah sure why not get your wife pregnant again when you re just 20 and she 19 yeah go for it urgh my mother violet evans was 37 and her ex husband ethan evans was 38 i remember the look on james face when i called my mum an immature bitch and then had to proceed to tell him her age it was priceless i sighed realizing for once i hadntany homework and probably wouldnthave much over break because the next day we had classes like care of magical creatures transfiguration and charms i was relatively good in those classes as it was so if we did get any work i d be able to complete it i loved christmas break but their were times of boredom you need that homework to pull you back from wishing for school and to help you remember things and i worked my ass off in class to get any homework finished so i was free the common room was too busy everybody was rushing to get their work done as if it d be an absolute disaster if they had any over break and everybody was loud and it was 10 30 for christ sake i sighed again and looked around sirius remus and peter were sat at a table with books all spread out and remus could be seen speaking pointedly and gesturing with his hands as he described something i made my way over to them seeing the book he currently had open was defense against the dark arts remus was really good in that class i scrunched my nose turned around and looked for james i still wasntin a great mood and i didntwant to hear sirius crack anymore pms jokes like had been for the past week even if i was over it now boys just assume that everything gone wrong with a girl has something to do with being a girl when half the time it because of a boy that the girl is in a pissy mood he was running his hand through his hair for what looked like the millionth time as i approached him sitting there on on what had been dubbed my couch with his work spread out on the coffee table he was writing furiously and amused i silently wished the professor luck at reading that what re you working on i asked him casually sitting next to him and picking up a piece of parchment he had finished with transfiguration he muttered frowning hard as he read over what he had written i went to make a joke and ask him if he could even read his own writing when he had finished but he wrote neat he picked up writing again not realizing how dumbfounded i was at this small discovery his quill moved blindingly fast but his writing was absolutely perfect it was somewhere between cursive writing and just printing his letters werenttoo big and the ones he did cursive on werentloopy and stretched they were curt and precise his writing was neater than my own i need that back for a second james voice interrupted my point blank stupid ly amazed thoughts of how good a writer he was oh oh yeah here i handed him the parchment back realizing i had been rather wide eyed as i stared and considered his writing why the bloody hell was everything about james potter so fascinating he added the parchment i had to the end of what he had just finished writing and put his name in the top left hand corner done i may have a potions essay left to write it amused me because we took the same classes so we d have the same amount of work yet james seemed to be swamped whereas i had finished ahead of schedule that night when i was asleep in your bed and just as i woke up i mentioned bridget and how pretty she was and that i was jealous and you told me i hadnta reason to be jealous and that i was pretty did you mean it i suddenly blurted the simple compliment had been gnawing at me since that night he did not pull his hazel eyes up from his work though beneath his thin framed glasses i saw him quirk an eyebrow and side glance at me no was all he said shuffling his completed papers and laying them aside oh i called you beautiful and yeah i meant it i felt my cheeks burn as he said this and i shut my eyes for a shaky second no one ever before had well called me beautiful or any form of the word i suppose when i was younger my grandparents may have called me cute or whatever but petunia wasntreally the prettiest child so they probably didntgive any more attention to the youngest but god dammit james potter thought i was beautiful and even though i wasnttrying to boost my ego i liked the thought of it him thinking such a thought i didntthink i was beautiful i was impassive when it came to my looks a n this is how this next part works lily is saying what she thinks of her thoughts and the part in bold is mainly james take on her looks or just glances into future conversations i know he already described her but every girl is insecure and i want to make certain that you all know that lily is no exception i hadnta chance to express my thanks because james had moved on to flipping through notes he had taken in potions class checking to be sure he had done every assignment that needed to be done by the time classes resumed in january we didntwrite exams before or after christmas break but we were usually given major assignments on either side of the break the only time we wrote exams was at the end of the school year what do you hope to find in a relationship someday i asked him again suddenly it seemed the only time i could ask something as personal as that was when his attention wasnton me at the moment and i had a second to get the courage to ask him this time james dropped his book shut and sighed removing his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose he looked to me are you trying to ensure that i ll have homework over the hols i shrugged you shouldn t ve been sleeping so bloody much lately maybe i d have a more convenient time to talk to you dont underestimate me who says all i ve been doing is sleeping he snapped at me shoving his glasses back on his face i noticed even though it was snapping he didntdo it properly his voice just held a bit more edge to it didntget any louder and stayed rather calm it amused me for two weeks in your dorm during the afternoon and evening i smiled in what would be an irritating way polishing a certain broomstick lately then potter he raised his eyebrows at me and looked positively stricken oh pish i was no kind of innocent and he looked like he was just discovering that funny thing is he never thought me to be anything but innocent oh god it such a big to do that i cantexplain yet but him thinking i was innocent was a comfort at times i want somebody who knows me strike one for me but what it matter right somebody who trusts me would put their life in my hands if it came down to it someone who doesntwant to change me somebody who one in a million and everything they say will keep me absolutely enticed and waiting for more someday i want to find somebody and i ll know i ll wake up with them for the rest of my life i want somebody who about as far from perfect that you ll ever find honest and sweet but proud and independent too oh and she has to cook and like my mum i grinned not looking for much was he and to my surprise he returned the question and you evans i frowned and blinked excessively what do you want i had never really considered it so i took the easy way out made myself out to be some kind of scarlet woman of course oh well i dontwant a relationship i going to be a seductress boys will push me against the wall and kiss my neck and the sounds they ll produce when i touch their hair will be unbelievable james had moved down onto the floor a few minutes ago as i better situated myself at the moment i was laying on my stomach at an angle so my upper half was sort of hanging off of the couch near where james was sitting he wouldntlook at me and that was because i was wearing a chocolate brown sweater that had a plunging neckline and sleeves that were too long and i was dangling off the side of the couch the sweater being pulled taut near the bottom as a couple of assets of mine struggled to stay hidden so maybe my cleavage was rather revealed it was the point my saying i was going to be a seductress you think i d be any good i asked trying to make my voice sound as throaty and husky as possible lily was all james said pointedly raising his eyebrows in my direction and i laughed flipping over onto my back and swinging my hair this way and that as my head hung off the couch i infact do have an essay to finish so i ll see you later ohkay i sat up as his voice went soft soft something i decided i didntwant to be you promise he frowned as he looked at me promise what lily that you ll see me later it s just gone 11 i dontknow how long i ll have to work on this he spoke slowly and reasonably as if he were trying to work a deal out with somebody i shrugged just come find me when you re done we ll take a walk james potter eyebrows flew high for the hundredth time that night as i briskly made my way to the girls dorm i had no idea who i was right now 1 48 am somebody was shaking me awake i groaned and muttered something involving my foot and their ass but they just laughed quietly when i had left james in the common room at 11 o clock i came up and just threw myself on my bed sinking into the matress and i went to sleep i needed that sleep a seductress i oh god i can never talk to james again ever wake up c mon there that walk we need to take are you serious it was james potter with messy hair and and dark circles and his invisibility cloak in hand oh i buried my head in my pillow and shook my head furiously how the hell did you get up here he laughed quietly i have my ways come on fuck we donthave to go i was insane earlier honestly i want to and so i was dragged from my bed and taken down into the common room the moonlight was so bright that it almost overwhelmed the glow of the fire as it poured in through the window it was a pretty light night you know one of those where it never gets completely dark or completely black or something there that eerie glow to the sky and you look out the window and can actually see things moving and it looked like it was freezing out probably ten below zero celcius 14 fahrenheit i guess just the way the untouched snow was glittering calling for somebody to come disturb it fill it with the imperfections of their day or perhaps just stand there looking at it the perfection of the crystal like snow flakes willing you to leave it be i ve not got my things i ll freeze i yawned as i looked to james all decked out in his winter wear here he handed me my winter coat that he told me he grabbed from the end of my bed i didntsee your scarf or mitts though so he lifted a scarf from the end of the couch and draped it around my neck allowing me to adjust it and i ve no gloves for you but we ll just see how cold it is i frowned just stared at him in disbelief he knew i wasntquite right earlier on but here he was and we were going for a walk no you see it just felt like he was trying to push me or something like ohkay we ll go with my stupid idea and when i get frostbite he can laugh at me and say how wrong i was but then he smiled and any thought of him just trying to defy me or do something in spite of me it just vanished because that smile was everything anyone would ever want and god why didnti want everything right now we could ve just gone for a walk around the common room or up and down the corridor or something i hissed at him as he threw the cloak over the two of us and we made our way out of the portrait hole he just smirked and all i could see was a faint outline of that smirk because under the cloak it was dark and absolutely stifling the corridors had no torches lit at this time of night or morning whatever it is so i pulled my wand out illuminated it and poked it through the divide in the cloak giving us some sort of idea where we were going finally and miraculously we were at the large oak doors in the entrance hall i bit my lip and was decidedly unnerved of how this place looked at night when you made the slightest movement it seemed to echo throughout the whole castle it was such a different thing seeing the castle at night or not seeing it everything was unnaturally dark and it seemed the light from the moon and sky stopped when it reached the windows of the castle oh god these damn doors make the loudest noise ever i muttered james took my wand from me and tapped it to the two door handles muttering something i held my breath as he pulled the door open silence i let it out in a woosh and james took the cloak off of us folding it up to a simple square small enough to fit into his pocket damn i had to remember to ask where that cloak came from and why the hell he had it honestly yeah sure go ahead give an invisibilty cloak that will enable you to sneak all over the bloody place to a marauder you re unbelievable james laughed tipping his head back and sounding so pleasantly awake you d be surprised we walked and the wind was blowing slightly and the scarf i was wearing was ruffling around me but he was walking close and those broad shoulders of his seemed to block the most bitter bit of the wind cold and i clenched my hands and unclenched them to keep them from turning blue with cold even if james potter wasntout here to prove me stupid i didntwant the frostbite we stopped about halfway down the path and just stood looking around my nose was stinging with the transition from warmth to cold and i sniffed a few times before letting a deep breath out is this the craziest thing you ve ever done james potter the wind was blowing lightly still chilling me to the bone but i just pulled my coat tighter around me and adjusted the scarf i think you d be surprised at the crazy stuff i ve done lily evans i laughed as james rubbed his gloved hands together and blew on them to warm them through the material well i glad you re doing something crazy with me it wasntcrazy far from it we were just out on the grounds at now 2 am in the morning it was just absolutely gorgeous out for some reason the fact we had snow just seemed to dawn on me and the moon was so bright and almost full the way it shone off of the snow and made it sparkle and twinkle almost more then the stars in the clear sky breathtaking i swear i glad too that was the end of the night for me him saying he was glad too but he went on you see i mean i hardly know you i rolled my eyes at this he had been saying it often we re hardly friends but here i am james we re friends you re my best friend his casual here i am there you are glances towards me suddenly changed and he stared at me your best friend he cleared his throat and licked his lips god i hate to say it because i dontknow what you think well obviously you think we re hardly friends but dammit you re my best friend and i wish you weren t this seemed to be the first real solid actual moment in our short friendship my nose wasntstinging with cold anymore it was stinging with a sudden rush of emotions and had the wind not been sweeping by us like it was i was sure a tear would ve fallen but my eyes were dry and none would produce because i would not blink and risk the chance of his gaze breaking from mine i had that gaze right now it was mine he was my best friend and i was not going to let those hazel green eyes pull away from me when he so desperately needed to know what he was to me you wish i wasn t because i so hesitant to admit a friendship i nodded and shoved my hands in my pockets this coat was too long my hands hardly reached the pockets that were almost at my knees but then he was taking my hands in his after blowing on his own again and staring at them instead of into my eyes i not good at friendships the boys have just always been my friends his forehead creased as he thought hard as if this talking to me and telling me things was going against everything he had formerly done i dont do new things they re foreign to me you re foreign to me but i think you re beautiful and i just so mixed up you know i dontknow how friendships with pretty girls work my hands seemed to be a ghostly pale against the black of his gloves and i wished wished wished his fingers would intertwine with mine and had they done so i wished i d be able to feel his skin on mine but he wasntsirius black and oddly enough i didntwant to kiss him or romanticly link myself to him in any way i just wanted him to hold my hands like he was if that all i could have right now if it all i wanted right now if it all that mattered right now is that a nice way of saying i dontmean as much to you as you mean to me but you re considering it his thumbs flickered over my skin and my breath was suddenly shaky and constricted it a nice way of saying that i dont want to think of you as my best friend but i can t not realize it please believe me when i say i hardly know you and you hardly know me but best friends is something that i can see and agree with i just not sure how to say it a grin split across his face and he looked positively petrified in this mysterious and handsome way of his i dontwant to admit defeat just yet must i say it i smoothed my lips together and shook my head slightly furiously biting back a rush of gratitude towards him in the form of tears you donthave to say a word he looked put out or something as if he wanted to say it say something but needed my ohkay first james swallowed and went to speak his lips parting slowly as if they were too dry to part quickly without hurting them i want to i just again dontknow how to dontsay it if you dontthink of me as one his eyes finally pulled from staring at my hands to hold my gaze your eyes positively sparkle he said softly his breath issuing in a puff of white vapour are they sparkling now james potter none of this was sinking in sparkling eyes i couldn t his eyes were absolutely intoxicating so deep and handsome and god he said my eyes sparkled so much god lily you re my best friend and i mean it just in a way i ve never known before if that means anything so much i choked out both of our stares going back to his hands almost dearly holding mine in front of him and we stood there 3 12 am i wondered if james had sent out some urgent order or called in a favour to the ghosts of hogwarts or to some adoring professor because there was absolutely no one around not even flich or his insane cat i was just expecting somebody and i kept looking to james out of the corner of my eye he was looking straight ahead and seemed light hearted so i decided why ruin it take our chances right we made it back to the common room and my eyes were itching to close i stifled a yawn and just stood there helpless as james took the cloak off us removed the scarf from around my neck and draped them over the arm of a couch he rubbed his hands together after discarding his things and went to warm them by the fire after throwing a few more pieces of wood onto the dying flames i watched him not daring to sit on the couch because i was sure to fall asleep and we had classes to wake up for i almost groaned at the thought transfiguration first thing lily his voice sounded loud in the empty common room opposite of what i had expected i expected something half hearted and exhausted but he sounded aware and fine yeah i joined him in standing next to the hearth come home with me for christmas and my eyes were suddenly very open wh what sorry pardon he smiled some hazy tired smile christmas if you re staying here and ve nothing better to do come home with me i no james i cantpossibly i couldn t no i mean that would just be horribly horribly wonderful yes you can i mentioned you in a letter to my mum and you know parents they talk and you being head girl i guess you were discussed and my mum heard that you stayed for most holidays he spoke slowly and fumbled with his hands all of them i corrected in a flat tone whenever james spoke on my family situation he just seemed uptight and afraid to say something wrong right well she told me if we were that good of friends then you should spend the hols with us and please dontworry about imposing my mum bloody lives for the holidays and probably has already bought you presents dontworry about buying presents for them we ll go to diagon alley once we re back in london but i think spending christmas together would be he trailed off looking to me for a hint of positive excitement it d be nice i said softly smiling a honest smile i knew you d smile he reached his hand out and nudged my chin and good she ll be utterly thrilled we stood in a bit of an awkward silence for a moment me smiling all the long james thank you i mean you didnthave to invite me he shrugged and swept a hand through his hair i want you there i nodded and felt a bit of an overwhelming urge to reach out and hug him what do you want for your birthday then it so on can you cook he asked simply quite well breakfast james grinned and took my hand in his giving it a quick squeeze i want breakfast for my birthday goodnight lily night james i moved my hand to my forehead and brushed my hair behind my ears before just pressing my cool palm to it it was the hand he had briefly held and i was so drained that i hadntenough left in me to properly experience it but his hands were cold and almost too dry and i was going to his house for christmas chapter 9 boys photographs 7 25 am boys dorm every other boy in the dorm was ready and on their way to breakfast three out of the four marauders included james potter was usually up early for james potter quite enjoyed the quiet before the storm if you will and he quite enjoyed a good cup of coffee and the morning prophet he was old fashioned and damn proud of it he had sleeping habits of a 65 year old man who had not yet warmed up to technology or sleeping past 6 am but not this morning remus wandered the dorm looking for his tie shouting to james to get the hell up as peter slung his bookbag over his shoulder see you later he said with a chuckle towards james before leaving the dorm as every other boy except for the remaining three marauders had already done wonder what he was up to last night sirius murmured to remus as he remus took role of the father figure on this morning and tore james hangings back james groaned and turned onto his stomach smothering his head into the pillows wake the fuck up prongs we need to talk as it is remus growled while sirius threw himself down onto the end of james bed landing hard on his legs ah c mon james do what he says it almost that time of the month sirius grinned up at remus s who rolled his eyes get off my bloody legs james murmured turning over onto his back after sirius had moved ohkay listen remus had taken to pacing and had his hands clasped behind his back as he did so i know lily important to you two now and that fine whatever and i know you have tendencies to not want to keep secrets from girlfriends she not either of our girlfriend sirius reminded needlessly shut up and i know lily s so more than a girlfriend she a friend i just asking neither of you to exploit us have we before black interrupted again no remus snapped stopping his pacing and turning to him but we ve not really established a trust when it comes to you and girls you go and tell her everything about the map and the passages and james invisibility cloak she would ve found out eventually she not stupid i know that exactly why i worried about this remus resumed his pacing he had never gotten like this over the whole werewolf issue before not even when it came to the 3 boys finding out it does get rather hard keeping secrets perhaps you should just tell her james murmured with a yawn a hand rubbing his face and the other adjusted his crooked glasses it gets rather hard keeping secrets try being the bloody werewolf remus sighed and looked disgusted to an extent i know she ll figure it out she ll start paying more attention to where you disappear to for 3 nights at the end of each month she ll start wanting to know why i gone she ll put it together before long and i just asking you to let me be the one to tell her once it been figured out how she ll react she a girl how do you expect her to react if she doesntreact the way you want her to it not like we re going to go and severe all ties with her sirius what the flying fuck is wrong with you i trying to be reasonable mate but you re making it rather hard she my friend too all right i get it she different she smart i ll tell her and we ll hope for the best got it james gave a nod yeah you know i sorry you ve just never suggested telling someone before i know remus muttered we can trust her sirius offered quietly we can remus lips quirked into a smile he had never heard those words fall from sirius black lips the marauders trusted one another obviously very immensely but even in certain aspects remus knew that sirius didnttrust anybody he found it rather amusing he was so smitten that he d completely abandon any thoughts of hesitating to trust her all right get the hell up james 9 15 am lily i was sitting in transfiguration class hardly coming to terms with the fact i d be going to the potters at the end of today sirius remus walked into class quickly not sending a glance in the direction of anybody they walked to a table across the aisle from the one i was sitting at remus took the inside seat and sirius sat in the one closest to the aisle peter tagged along and sat at the empty table behind them james did not come to class until 15 mintues after it started he walked in threw a look to mcgonagall who was going to each table to check on how the students were doing with the assignment she had just given nobody was being particularly quiet so nobody really noticed james come in late he did it with some sort of quiet grace and confidence taking longer strides than he normally would putting those long muscular legs to good use he nodded at mcgonagall as she looked up and he cleared his throat as if signalling it was all right for her to continue with whatever she had been saying and james potter sat in the empty seat next to me lo lily he crooned grinning cheekily and leaning back in the wooden chair bit late dontyou think i tried to sound casual but i ended up laughing lightly in a disbelieved sort of way yeah it your fault i grinned and licked my top lip tsk ing him hush and he just smiled further sirius looked up from his conversation with remus and shook his head at his friend with a smile on his face much like mine sort of disbelieving but he was proud too lucky bastard didnteven get in trouble sort of ruin the thrill of it remus scoffed and threw sirius a you re ridiculous look ruin the thrill of it you stupid whatever he said was drowned out for me because james had picked a lock of my hair up twirled it for moment and released it i looked back to him and tilted my head smiling what up i asked quietly nothin he looked quite sincere but that the last time we stay out til 3 in the morning lil he said quietly through a grin i laughed rather openly and just a split second after james 3 in the morning comment remus looked sharply over to us and stared before looking back to sirius i stared right back at him for a moment wondering how he had heard what james said because he had heard it james had almost whispered it because it would only make sense to the two of us taken out of context i could only imagine what remus was thinking i did not know how he heard it though his hearing couldntbe that good the aisles were wide and sirius was sitting on the outside and the thing is remus was and had been for a bit now putting pieces together before there was even a puzzle to be made and i would deny that puzzle for as long as possible and sirius black was seemingly as oblivious as peter seemingly until 12 noon that day where he admitted he knew he had no hold on me where he suddenly became everything i remember i had known for a brief moment when we had kissed 12 30 pm lunch i had just gone to get a button down sweater to put on over my uniform shirt the shirt was white i was a girl it was cold self explanatory i was chewing on my lip before descending the marble staircase to go back to grab a bite to eat 15 days january 2rd was when we went back and classes resumed the 4th 2 weeks then with with a family that was so good this amazing family who had so much history and was so pureblooded and seemed to have good hearts but a family that i didnteven know a boy i hardly knew really 15 days i was just realizing that i hadntpacked yet i hadn t really thought about it yesterday i was a different person or so it seemed yesterday i would ve considered jada morgan a friend yesterday i hated james potter hardly knew sirius and remus and had barely spoken a word to bridget harris i was stupid and so sure of what i would settle for once i had graduated i d meet a nice well off ministry official get married have a couple of kids and be a homemaker it what every woman seemed to be doing in the past decade less and less were applying for ministry jobs or to be a healer and so many were just settling and being content but not knowing what else they could have had a couple of years ago i was exactly like those women but now i had no idea who i was or what i wanted or who i wanted for that matter and what i d be doing when i was finished school and it was the most exhilirated and alive that i had ever felt even if i was scared while being so and just then i noticed sirius black was at the bottom of the staircase seeming to be to be waiting for me hey you i greeted the marauder softly sweetly and with a smile of the same description on my face it just happened when he was near me hey he said in a quick breath and the next thing i knew he was slipping his hand through the crook of my elbow and pulling me over to a shadowy corner sirius wasntas tall as remus or james remus was a couple inches over 6 feet and james was probably 6 feet just on or a little taller but sirius was in the 5 foot range 5 9 probably he was not that tall and i was just noticing it he didntneed to stoop down that much that night he kissed me and he could see into my eyes so bloody well i was 5 5 so he wasnttoo much taller than me it was suddenly apparent to me and suddenly the most dizzying thing there could possibly be it was nice to feel protected to feel shielded and hidden and usually the height of a boy gave you the most secure feeling in the world james was tall being around him i always felt hidden felt safe from any accusations and sirius being shorter i thought maybe i d feel uncomfortable or exposed but he somehow still managed to hold himself a bit higher and a bit stronger he was warm i would not get over how warm sirius was even if those eyes were such a cold striking colour he was warm and he was close and he always had a casual shrug look to his shoulders and he was so undeniably handsome sometimes i felt dark deep brown eyes would fit him better for he had dark deep chocolate brown hair the darker tone of his skin but the second i imagined him with brown eyes i then couldntimagine him without those grey grey blue eyes they were piercing and sometimes breathtaking and yes they wholly belonged to sirius black excited for the hols he asked with a slight grin shoving his hands into his black uniform slacks i am i must admit are you i watched him almost eagerly just anticipating any facial expression he were to make i am yes they re always enjoyable i went to james for the summer so i ll be spending christmas with remus i ve just alternated between the two since 3rd year but it doesntmuch matter remus is always over to the potter as it is and his whole family spends christmas eve at the potter s his parents and what not i was thinking though lily you i dontknow what you re doing for the holidays but chances have it we wontbe seeing each other and i dontthink perhaps we shouldntexchange gifts oh all right i nodded that fine i understand i just afraid it would make things too real my eyebrows flew high and i stared at him feeling rather superior that i came to level with about his chin dammit had i been wearing heels i may be able to stare him square in the eye i felt some surge of anger or something too real too real i voiced my thoughts what about this has been too real my voice was almost shrill but i struggled to keep it at a whisper everything seemed to echo in these halls you ve kissed me once and have shown no signs of wanting to persue something i cantassume you want something when you don t seem like you do when you ve not said anything i dontknow how you feel about me you seem to think things will fall into bloody place you dontknow how i feel about you i kissed you for christ sake that should be saying something i dontknow how you feel about me you and james being so bloody close and knowing more of one another than i ve even thought about he looked away from me as he spoke gesturing with his hands and almost pouting stop acting like a bloody child james and i are friends at least he tells me things he shown interest in being friends so thus we re friends you ve shown interest in nothing since that night stop bloody well lying he said calmly to me spinning back to face me i have so i ve tried so hard to figure it out and let you know that i feel something for you i pursed my lips and stuck out my chin trying to hold myself higher you re a bastard sirius black he had gone to turn away but he turned back around and tilted his head at me studying me a bit as if he were amused by my comment and then he was cradling the back of my head in his hand leaning down and giving me a chaste kiss his lips had not changed since that night i had kissed them he hadntchanged he was still everything that i remembered from that night still warm still burning still held some secret passion his lips were warm and sweet and begged to be kissed properly for he would not let me do that he just pressed his lips to my own and seemed to relish in the feel of it for a moment his teeth hardly grazed my bottom lip and i was silently pleading with him to deepen the kiss but he did not he pulled back after a few seconds and looked down at me the short distance that it was and took a deep breath that all i wanted i wasntsure whether he wanted the kiss or for me to call him a bastard you confuse me so badly i ve just wanted to have something with you i want something with you it just stings to know i ve got no hold on you but you lily have have quite a hold on me i swallowed and shook my head briefly i sorry that i so awful at expressing my appreciation for those who affect me as immensely as you do but by any means do not think that you ve got no hold on me you do that all i can offer i dontknow how to go any further than that at the moment i won t i just i would settle for so little i don t want the world i dontwant some fairy tale romance i want i want this i want to be warm and know that i affect you and just a hand to hold or something god damn it sirius i paused and ran a hand through my hair and i for christmas i will be seeing you i m i going to james s i spoke stiffly almost coldly i didntcare though because i couldntthink about this now i was going to be happy for christmas dammit oh yeah he didntseem to hear anything but my last sentence i guess i will be seeing you until then lily he took one hand from his pocket and gave me a two finger wave before turning his back on me and walking back to the great hall and he looked absolutely fine remus had been right if i hurt sirius i would end up hurt because sirius wouldnt be hurt i just tried to hurt him elicit some sort of jealous rampage out of him he was calm he was fine with it he didntbat an eye and it was going to drive me bloody well mad i wasnthurt slightly put out but not hurt and now i was dizzy for a completely different reason i did not know what any of that had meant i meant something to him he wanted something with me but once again it was left hanging there waiting for something someone to say yeah they re going to have something more honestly though were we going to have something more i stared after him but for a second before tearing my eyes away and putting my fingers to my bottom lip which was protruding in a sort of pout the second kiss was much like the first and i closed my eyes silently praying that every kiss had with any person would feel like the first i doubted it could get much better than that the feelings may change and you may become better at it but there was nothing quite like even in my years to come the first time you kissed a boy lips hoping he enjoyed kissing yours just as well i was just about to leave the shadowy corner and go into the great hall when the doors opened the tall golden handsome that came out from the hall made me smile almost involuntarily he pulled something from his pocket looked around the entrance foyer didntspot me and then pulled open one of the huge doors and i found myself following him through them so perhaps he wanted to be alone why else would he go outdoors in 15 degree weather there was something about him some secret mystery not as mysterious as james for james was subtly mysterious and i would learn just how boldly mysterious remus was how it was fitting for him to be secretive and mysterious he had a world of secrets he lived in a secret hello lily evans he greeted smoothly as i joined him on the cold stone step he was leaning back against the jut of stone wall there was in this little enclosure at the top of the steps and he looked good he did indeed look weary but in a self assured way in an ohkay way and there was a cigarette hanging from his mouth it took me by surprise sort of it seemed right normally i thought smoking was obnoxious my mum smoked those long thin cigarettes that rich women smoked to look posh or something she had no reason to smoke though her friends did it that a tad pathetic isntit it not as if she led a stressful life she couldn t ve been happier when her and dad got divorced she got lots of money out of that but remus seemed beyond his years everything about him his eyes were full of some emotion that i had not experienced in my 18 years and would not experience properly some sort of mixture of rage and desperation and love and hate and need all pounded together ruthlessly they were lovely though and the premature lines that protruded on some days around his eyes they were there for a reason a 17 year old boy did not have those for no reason a 17 year old boys eyes did not look like that for no reason and his gaze was that of impassive scrutiny i wondered if he trusted me or liked me for that matter he was somebody that could hide well hide everything well how are you doing he asked though it did not sound sincere in the slightest remus lupin removed the cigarette from his mouth after taking a drag and blew smoke out in a straight shot good enough i replied chuckling needlessly i felt awkward for some reason i didntknow you smoked way to be blunt lily well you do now and he grinned at me with his dimpled grin i always thought he always had one single dimple in his left cheek but it was because he usually just quirked that side of his mouth in a lopsided grin they weren t ugly oh my god way too indented dimples they were slight curves near his mouth and they were the only boyish aspect to him thank god it the holidays eh remus said whilst flicking the end of the cigarette against the stone of the castle and ashes flew from the end of it yeah yeah i quite happy sirius going to your place mmm remus nodded we always end up hanging out together though james sirius and i almost every day of break i nodded slightly as he spoke showing i was giving my attention he then looked to me kind of sharply but in a lazy sort of dominant fashion going to james place mmm remus said it the same way i had mentioned sirius and for a moment i didntcatch on i had just began to nod but caught myself in the midst of it james told you i choked out not enjoying the smirk playing over remus face did you expect him not to he quipped back raising an eyebrow i dontknow i just dontworry he didntmean to it slipped and he didntjust say that to cover up he looked absolutely mortified which one of you is going to be the one to tell sirius i already did and you were right he calm and collected fuck i folded my arms and hugged myself looking away from remus and instead out over the grounds there got to be some story behind you lily evans did your parents die in a tragic accident he knew very well that they were both alive are you some unbelievable witch with powers beyond your own expectations are you a veela what the bloody hell is it that is so amazing about you because there got to be something he was shouting yet looked perfectly calm though he seemed to take longer drags off of the cigarette my best friends are blinded by something about you and i d sure as hell like to know what that and what your intentions are my intentions i nearly laughed damn me for wanting friends yeah do you not like to share remus lupin sure seems it he sighed and sank down the wall until he was sitting against it i felt kind of bad he was frowning and staring at his hands until he raised one to take the cigarette from his mouth do you smoke he asked and i shook my head going to stand by the wall he was sitting against good dontstart none of the other marauders do by the way somehow he knew that would be some sort of reassurance to me i sank down next to him and he threw the cigarette out over the side of the stair banister the wind was blowing against the stone wall we were leaning on so we were sheltered from it i not trying to hurt anybody remus i said quietly after a few mintues of freezing together he shook his head slowly i know i just really hostile towards you i dontmean to be i just god lily what the hell are you doing with them you and james you were out til 3 in the morning i overheard we went for a walk remus honestly we re not doing anything stupid he nodded curtly and seemed intent on not looking at me i wish you and be friends too i not trying to take your or anybody s place i said quietly i know stop trying to reassure me or whatever the hell i not insecure i just worried or seeing things that arentthere or something i never thought remus lupin to be bitter or hostile or upset or anything that he was right now it was something i would rarely see and when i did it meant something to me he was trying hard not to let me see him but i broke something down around him that bitterly cold day and as hard as it got after that i saw a bit of him and he couldnttake that back now he was not any sort of divine right now there was no glow and no charming grin he didntsmell of sweet liquor or nice cologne he smelled of rich cigarette smoke and the crisp winter breeze sitting there talking to him indulging him opening up to him i did not know which scent i could have preferred i think you re strong remus i determined to make you trust me with your friends a small smile split across his face and he quickly took both of my hands in his own clasping them between his i smiled a small smile at this his hands werentwarm but warmer than the biting air i do trust you they trust you that what scary about all of this earning the trust of the marauders even if through one of them was an immense step for me and my eyes stung as i considered all of this and was decidedly overwhelmed sitting there in the cold with him i freezing lil he rubbed his hands over mine giving them some sort of quick rugged warmth let go in i nodded but was silent and just let him lead me in through the doors we stood together for a moment in the entrance hall and he draped his arm around my shoulders as we walked to the doors to the great hall i wondered something as we stood for a moment i wondered whether i should get my hopes up you know when you said you trusted me did you mean you trusted me with your friends or his arm came from around my shoulders quickly and he faced the doors turning his back to me or did you mean that you trusted me as a person hem he cleared his throat needlessly and a hand slowly ran back through his hair i trust you with my friends with james sirius i trust you to care about em you know whatever the hell it is you guys want in a friendship i trust you could succeed quite well in giving them that i don t trust that you wont hurt them i donttrust that you wonthate them at some point i donttrust you no lily and how exactly do i earn your trust it was weird it very much felt like asking for a blessing he turned around and met my eye finally i thought it a bit cowardly not to when you can look me in the eye and say that you trust me us he said reasonably though very much like he was surrendering something i stared into those mature stormy eyes full of some sort of turmoil and strength can you do it lily remus said in barely a whisper his mouth quirking into a sad smile i pursed my lips preparing to say something no i can t i ve no reason to trust you i muttered curtly walking closer to him not yet anyway i need something more than a couple of months he looked amused they do trust you sirius does at least he the only one who been vocal of it i guess maybe he is blinded by something ah blinded by lily evans and you know you re right you do have no reason to trust me or any of us it nice though we re all on the same page except for sirius black who was incredibly out of the loop for lack of a better phrase 5 11 pm we were to be at hogsmeade station by 6 o clock and on the train by quarter after the train wouldntbe in at platform 9 3 4 until well past midnight it was just gone ten after five and i had just finished packing i had parted with remus at lunch i had gone back to the great hall and he did not classes went fast not much work was accomplished i was skipping out on dinner because i hadntpacked a single thing until 10 minutes ago and when i was packing i was just mindlessly doing it i was panicking or something of the sort james had only spoke to me that once in transfiguration and he had mentioned nothing of christmas i was beginning to wonder whether he really had invited me or i just imagined it or something sometimes i do that wonder if stuff i or other people had said was actual and real and i was thoroughly doubting my sanity at the moment thinking james potter would not invite me to his family house for christmas this family of high standards and purest blood there was and if he had invited me maybe he didntmention it again because he hoped i d forget about it after he realized it was for the better if i didntshow up maybe he became revolted at the thought of me staying with his family for 2 weeks maybe he realized his family would not accept me maybe i wasntgood enough to bring home even as a friend hell i didntconsider myself good enough for james potter as a friend i couldntimagine bringing me home to mom and on top of all of that if i was really going home with james potter i didntknow what to wear to meet his parents it would be gone 1 in the morning by the time we were back to his home i d assume and maybe it d be acceptable if i didntlook completely put together but i didntknow i didntknow what to expect i didntknow what they expected i was so bloody lost and on the verge of a break down and it hurt so much because i missed i missed my family my grandparents my sister even my dad my aunts uncles and cousins they were all scattered all over the country and even other continents so it was impossible to get together for the holidays anyway there was no sense in me going home to an empty house i looked to my bed covered with all of the clothes that i hadntpacked and i just stared i put my hands over my eyes and then slid them into place on my cheeks what do i do i bemoaned still staring at the clothing though i was talking about more than just the attire there was a knock to the door and then it opened and i sniffed quickly on the tears threatening to fall fuck crying i so over it and there was james potter in dark rinse blue relaxed fit jeans a white button down with small horizontal grey blue stripes he was fidgeting with the buttons on his cuffs and furrowing his brow at me lil honestly we ve got to get your luggage down to the carriages he quit with the buttons focusing on me i um i know i it there i just he grabbed the baggage and took it from the dorm i did not see it again until his house quickly turning back to me and noting i was still in my uniform you can get changed you know you donthave to wear that james i croaked clenching my teeth and willing my eyes to stop burning i dontthink i ll i mean i dontfeel as if i should go with you now bullocks lily what the matter the dorm was semi dark and i couldntsee properly into those hazel green of his but i felt it i felt him looking at me and that scared me senseless am i will i be imposing honestly did your mum just feel bad and ask you to invite me out of some sort of twisted pity please dontunderestimate my mum am i good enough to be there james honestly he stepped closer to me and i set my shoulders back staring back into the fact that was staring at me honestly my family not like that the malfoy s or whatever they re pureblooded yes but it means nothing to them they rather admire muggle things they ve got electricity and everything i just thought maybe you d like to have a proper christmas if you d rather go home i dontknow please though my family not like that dont ever think of them to be they ll adore you adore me god a girl wasntabout to ask for that but it sure sounded nice even if i hardly believed it or had any any faith in his words say something his lips barely moving and his words drawn together believe me would you fucking believe me please lily i opened my mouth and tried to say something but nothing would allow itself to be said i couldntdeclare my dissatisfaction with his reassurance you cantact like that you realize you cantjust nod accept what i say but not tell me when it bothering you is it bothering you lily darling and suddenly my lack of faith and lack of strength and lack of every good feeling came flooding back and my head took a slight lurch forward at the power of these emotions he frowned at me a concerned frown and stepped closer tilting his head and gazing down at me lily darling he repeated it those two words my name and darling that could save me a hundred times over right now you have nothing to worry about not a thing if you dontwant to come then that a shame because it the holidays and i not about to let you stay here alone a playful smile one i didntsee often blessed his lips and i shook my head slowly i sorry i just got really insecure for a moment this afternoon my mind just started playing all sorts of games on me i turned to watch where he had went over to the side of my bed looking down at my scattered clothes he pulled his wand out and said an incantation that lit a flame in the lamps throughout the dorm i want to look nice as absolutely corny as that sounds he just nodded concentrating fully on my wardrobe they wontcare but i understand you look nice i complimented and he shrugged not looking at me and brushing the comment off pick something i ll tell you what i think i dontfancy picking girls clothes out but it wouldntbe the first time the image of james grudginly helping a smitten girl pick out an outfit made me grin in my mind that smitten girl wasntmyself though i didntsee it i picked a pair of darker rinsed jeans with a slight flare that almost matched his own in the colour he nodded casual yet classy he muttered and i laughed at him i picked a boat necked sweater up that was quite soft to touch it was a purple ish charcoal colour lovely change he turned his back and folded his arms i stared for a moment feeling hesitant and amused over his quick responses he just wanted to get it over with will it look lily hem we have to leave this castle by 5 30 in order to be on time all right i not going to look i no no no it fine i tru ohkay i bit my lip and cursed myself inwardly i couldnteven say i trust you as the saying after lunch time with remus i was weary to venture onto uneasy conversation topics with james inparticular i took my shirt off and tossed it onto the bed except for it didntland on the bed james was still semi standing in the way and it hit him and draped over his shoulder he laughed quietly and picked it up from his shoulder putting it where i had orginally intended for it to land i pulled the sweater on and jeans on clearing my throat as indication i was done he turned around and it might have just been the flickering lamps all around the dorm but his gaze was penetrating once again but this time it didntscare me senseless oh this necklace doesntmatch i went over to the bed stand and found a simple gold chain a diamond dangling from it embedded in gold can i see that he asked with interest as i took off the necklace i had been wearing it nice kinda old fashioned looking but yeah it nice where did you get it why did james have to be like that most guys dontreally give a damn where a necklace came from but of course me wearing the one sirius gave me james would want to know oh it was a birthday present i clasped the other necklace on and he set sirius gift to me on the stand there was a moment of silence and i just shut my eyes my hand jumping to my collarbone and tracing over it like i sometimes did to calm myself i crossed my other arm over to cradle my elbow and just continued to trace my fingertips back and forth it was warm in the dorm and i was less nervous about a 6 hour long train ride with james to james house to meet james family so i guess we re done in here he waved his wand and the clothes on my bed disappeared to my closet thanks i said quietly opening my eyes and looking to him he came closer to me and was smiling a bit at me he seemed determined to hold my gaze not let my eyes fall from his and not let his own fall from mine james didntlike coming off disrespectful to me i found after time went on he liked to look in my eyes but never would let me catch him looking me as a whole over do i look ohkay i voyaged trying to push him you look lovely he answered quietly his eyes not leaving mine i was blinking excessively and him not at all you didnteven look i pointed out a bit amused and then he did something that surprised me and would continue to surprise me his eyes moved slowly down my face jumping back to hold my gaze for a moment but then continued trailing down when his gaze came to my hand tracing over the base of my neck he came closer he licked his lips mindlessly and reached a hand out carefully taking my necklace in his hand i quickly moved my hand away careful to avoid any contact with his skin he let the necklace drop back to my collarbone and parted his lips as if to say something but he said nothing just reached his hand forward quickly and touched the diamond again then touching my collarbone and then he pulled his hand back and frowned you look fine really he muttered a bit of a gruff tone to his voice i pressed my lips together trying to contain my laughter at his modesty it was him doing the touching it ohkay you know i said the amusement coming out in my voice and probably dancing in my eyes or something i like shoulders way too much we ve all got our quirks james laughed and put a hand on his face yeah hem get your coat he grinned a toothy grin at me and i did as he said i put my coat on and james grabbed my hand pulling me from the dorm muttering about how women are always slow as soon as we got to the end of staircase it turned into a slide and then back to the staircase james grinned at me the charm we learned isntpermanent i shook my head and looked around the rather deserted common room a lot of people were going home for christmas seeming their wasnta ball or anything to stick around for hem so i convinced james being heads didntmean we needed to have a bloody ball he went for it neither of us were too in to decorating and planning just to make other people happy you know i didntwant to do the hall up all nice and those bloody slytherins come enjoy my hard work you know thank you for this i hadntlet his hand go from mine the very ends of our fingertips were loosely holding onto the others and i not sure he even noticed this for christmas it nothing my birthday soon i looking forward to that breakfast in bed i rolled my eyes he honestly thought i was going to cook for him for his birthday present he was such a boy just a complete boy he d be 18 in 2 days and may just be considered a man if he didnthave such fly away hair and such a boyish grin james potter could be a man maybe if he tried james potter was a man and need not try i was just too taken with this untainted unflawed boyish image of him to open my eyes wide enough and realize just how mature he was just who he was it ll be fine lily we stopped by the couch and he picked his coat up throwing it on unclasping our intertwined fingers it wasntmuch though for i couldntproperly feel the warmth of his skin touching so little of it every bloody detail of him though every little thing i wanted to know every little thing but not in a way that was more than friends him i were so so in the midst of things moving towards something figuring out just how much the other meant to them and when his jacket and gloves were on i had put my own gloves on he began walking towards the portrait hole his friends had already left it seemed and he grabbed onto my hand again walking along at a fast pace so he might ve been dragging me but all i knew was his hand he hummed quietly as we walked a sort of soothing melody that was absolutely lovely christmas lily i told myself will be absolutely lovely 5 35 pm we hadnteven left the castle yet well we got hungry james skipped out on dinner too to finish an assignment that had to be passed in by the end of the day and i as i said was packing so we stopped at the kitchens ohkay we really need to go catch a carriage if there re any left c mon we started walking at a fast pace and as we neared the front doors we caught up with bridget and ray also remus sirius coming from the direction of the entrance to the syltherin common room i didnthave time to raise suspicious eyebrows hey i said cheerfully jumping next to bridget as she grinned hey you guys late too let go catch that last carriage and we did all 6 of us it was a rather crammed ride while we were walking to the carriages bridget and i legged behind the boys who were beating on each other and throwing snow and i didntreally want to be cold you re going to james for christmas she said in a sort of whispery squeal yeah i am i smiled watching the raven haired marauder duck a snowball thrown by sirius it was funny and maybe a little ironic james would always duck anything thrown by sirius whether litterally or just between the three of us in the times to come james was level headed and god bless him for that oh i ve got some thing for you not a present just she pulled a few things from her pocket here we kept walking and i took the photographs she handed me there were more but these are the ones with you guys thought you might like to have them there were 4 or 5 pictures from that night of the bonfire some magical and some were still the first in the stack was of bridget and ray that i had taken this one was magical i smiled and looked to the next one it was james bridget and ray the two boys had their arms draped around bridget and were leaning on her grinning this one was magical too and they were ruffling her hair at the moment the next was well it was james and i i didnteven remember this picture god i muttered holding it cloesr to my face and inspecting it we werentmoving this was the only one that wasntmagical the two of us were sitting on one of the logs and james had his arm around my shoulder i had one of my hands splayed against his chest and looked as if i had been laughing when the picture was taken he was looking straight at the camera and it may have been the most flattering picture i had ever seen of him it was dark behind us but the flash from the camera and the glow from the fire illuminated his face shadows were cast down at angles over his cheeks and it was just that that little bit of mystery protruding the embarrassing thing though was that i was looking at him looking up at him while he grinned a boyish grin at the camera with this adorning admiring sort of look on my face why isntthis one magical i asked showing her the one i was talking about i dontknow it the only one of the bunch that didntcome back developed magically curious i guess but really what else is there for you two to do i think that picture kinda says it all lily no bridget just let not talk about any of that right now she offered a nod a slight smile on her face as i looked to the next one it was of bridget i and we were grinning wildly the last one was was of james i dance twirling or whatever he had done that night i sucked in a sharp breath and was astonished at how nice i looked not physically or anything my hair didntlook incredible that night and my eyelashes werentcurled to perfection or anything i just looked nice and happy whilst being twirled by him safe thank you for these best present i ll probably get 7 45 pm it had been so long since i had taken this train ride the train ride to school was bloody hetic and crowded and you didntappreciate the way the train lurched about giving your stomach the most upset feeling it had been awhile since i had gone home for christmas but it was the same as always it certainly wasntas crowded and for some reason the ride seemed slower calmer like we were in less of a rush there was snow on the ground and soft flurries falling in no hurry as we pressed on the scenery changed the trees had ice caked around their branches and were sagging slightly from the weight of it i sighed and leaned my head against the cool window bridget i were in a compartment alone for the time and she had gone to find the snack cart we had been in a compartment with the boys but they took to being typical boys for once they had been eating chocolate frogs and somehow twisted their minds up enough to find something perverted in a picture of a wizard or witch or in their name the cards found in the chocolate frogs so bridget and i found a compartment a few down from theirs i had put the pictures bridget gave me in my coat pocket and had my hand tucked in it making sure they were still there and they were and i hated myself for loving them so much hey girls i think they were programmed to sense whatever free food just as bridget came back with an armful of snacks the boys entered peter i wasntsure where he was maybe his parents were just going to meet him in hogsmeade and apparate with him from there peter could apparate which surprised me but yes james and sirius could apparate myself and remus hadntyet gotten around to taking the test i suppose it was a bit of an inconvenience for james but oh well hey bridget i greeted and we all just ate and talked and hexed each other for awhile 10 00 pm everybody was absolutely exhausted and i couldntbelieve we were still on a bloody train ohkay it was all magical and pretty at first but now it was dark and you couldntsee the snow and the moon and stars were hidden behind thick clouds and we were all just sprawled out over the seats you wanna go see if we can get some sleep ray suggested quietly to bridget and she nodded see you later perhaps if not merry christmas i ll owl you i nodded and smiled wishing her a merry christmas as well i yawned and leaned my head back against the seat feeling quite surreal like the train was moving and we were going home but after so many hours you just become accustom to it and the odd lighting and just seem to sink into this boxed up world my head felt strange train just did that to me eh remus let go get some sleep too remus nodded and bade goodnight to me sirius leant down and pecked me quickly on the cheek because james potter was staring out the window and not at all at us i dontthink sirius even realized it never even took note it was just out of luck that both boys seemed oblivious to some things by half passed 10 the lights on the train were dimmed and my eyelids drooped suddenly feeling this overpowering sense of rest peace and by half passed ten james and i hadntsaid a word to one another we hadn t really talked since before we got onto the train but that was ohkay because we had two and a half hours left to this train ride i got up from the seat and closed the doors of the compartment going to settle into the cushions and try to get some sleep i took a pillow and blanket down from the storage racks and lay my head down on the pillow watching james sitting in the seat across from me stare out the window my eyes fluttered shut and i took a deep shaky breath as nerve wracking as the train ride was i could stay in this compartment forever i am so unbelievably exhausted james muttered finally pulling his eyes from the window and standing up as he stood i sat up and looked up at him it feels kind of nice though i gave a nod and he sat next to me taking the blanket that i hadntcovered up with and spreading it over our laps i didntrelax against him though but instead took the collar of his shirt loosely in my hands and flipped it out straight once it was fixed i kept my grip on it and stared at his adam apple rather than his face james moved his hands to my upper arms and rubbed them slowly for a moment before my forehead came forward and rested on his chest it was the closest thing to a hug we were daring for at the moment it was warm in the compartment but there was some kind of refreshing coolness floating from the glass of the window soothing my burning cheeks all right james murmured near my hair after a few moments of nothing i pulled my forehead away and brought my feet up onto the seat james pushed himself up against the backrest near the window and sprawled out his hand was lazily playing with my hair and he smiled a small tired smile at me c mere he muttered taking his fingers from my hair i crawled up and found my head rest nicely against his chest the rest of me curling up alongside him i was almost overwhelmed by this simple gesture a place to rest just catch some sleep it was innocent and i was so tired and so emotionally drained that i just wanted to sleep cry maybe but i was too tired for that the sense of security he offered was much more than i was able to realize then on december 19th 2 and a half months after i had properly began something with him but that security that safety remained the same throughout forever really it never wavered but just took me some time to recognize it my dad will pick us up we can go straight to bed once we get there nobody will be up you can meet em in the morning he muttered and i could feel the words before i heard them sense his chest vibrated or something as he spoke mmm hmm i so dizzy you know with this tingling warmth james hand was crawling along my forehead into my hair and then back out he was part of the dizzying warmth i not warm it just my senses are on some kind of overload i didntknow what i was talking about but i heard him make a barely audiable sound as he pressed his palm to his lips and then to my cool forehead and i wasntconcerned for once that day about christmas there was just james acting so completely comfortable and pleasantly unlike himself no it was him just being comfortable and i was just beginning to accept the fact that he was changing a bit whether he knew it around me comfort we both needed that and right now had it abc
