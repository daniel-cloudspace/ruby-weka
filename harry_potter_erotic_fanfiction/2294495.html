great kingdoms a strong and powerful king controlled most of the wizarding world he was a kind and just ruler and his kingdom mirrored that with its abundant wealth and strength but the king and proud father of 4 was old and was nearing the end of his days he pondered on which of his children were best to rule in his stead godric the brave rowena the wise helga the loyal or salazar the cunning thus he decided to split his grand kingdom in equal shares he gave each of his children a quarter but in the center where the four kingdoms met laid an equal radius void of any ownership by the four kingdoms here in this radius of free land stood the king castle hogwarts and the small town of hogsmeade this land remained free of claim the birthplace to each of the four royals and none rightfully owned it but the king so the lands were divided on the night of halloween to godric rowena helga and salazar they each chose a name and a coat of arms to suit their kingdom and their coronations were held at the hogwarts castle thus beginning the rule of the four great kingdoms gryffindor the court of the chivalrous and brave ravenclaw the realm of the wise hufflepuff the land of the loyal slytherin the kingdom of the cunning and ambitious over time the kingdoms began to mimic the virtues of their respective rulers gryffindor had become one the strongest and most daring kingdoms in the land ravenclaw boomed as the prominent intellectual center and their wit endless hufflepuff was known to the most loyal to all kingdoms hard working and unafraid of toil was their motto and then came slytherin quit choosy when it came to those who were citizens of its lands was the slickest and most conniving kingdom of the four the four kingdoms flourished under the rule of their monarchs each strong and steadfast but unfortunately as all good things come to an end so did the time of the grand high king of hogwarts this was a sad time for each of the kingdoms and the streets of the kingdoms were mournful and desolate but before his death the king had asked his children to preserve the castle to never let it die and from this the four rulers came together to found the wizarding world first ever hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry thus with the late high king right hand advisor as the caretaker of the castle and the creation of the sorting hat as an equal medium for sorting students into their respective houses the school began everything was peaceful until salazar king of slytherin insisted it would be in the best interest of the school and kingdoms if only the purest of purebloods be allowed to attend hogwarts naturally the four founders refused saying that bloodlines have nothing to do with the success of the student and its powers argument after argument finally lead to the withdrawal of the fourth king and founder but he didntleave quietly for he vowed that one day his heir and most loyal follower would some day set it all right and no mudblood or any other half ling would muddy the halls of the school or eventually the four kingdoms ever again once salazar left he started his own school of it within his marshy country and denying admittance to any who wasntborn of magical purity he called his school durmstrang here in this school he taught the form of dark arts to all his students this outraged the other rulers but being out of their jurisdiction they had no power against it years after the hogwarts dispute princess relena daughter of queen rowena of ravenclaw too decided to start her own school with the blessings of her aunt helga and uncle godric the beaubatons academy of magic was started the three schools thrived and a small healthy competition soon developed between the three schools relations between the four kingdoms remained quite well although with some strain from slytherin the four kingdoms blossomed lands expanded strengths stabilized and reputations grew for a thousand or so years things remained the same that was until the slytherin king voldemort felt it was his duty to follow in the footsteps of slytherin finest king salazar his first mission other than complete domination was to rid the world of the unclean unfit witches and wizards of muggle decent and even the muggles themselves in his quake he obliterated anything and everything in his path for 11 years this continued as he ransacked villages destroyed fortresses and terrorized everyone little did he know that his downfall would be met within the walls of his greatest enemy castle before the infant prince harry potter of gryffindor on the night of halloween lord voldemort planed to destroy the gryffindorian court to establish himself at the top of the most powerful kingdom in the land already wounding the other two kingdoms voldemort wanted the scarlet and gold kingdom of gryffindor to fall to burn he wanted the royals to suffer as he wanted the kingdom to suffer at this voldemort paralyzed the newly crowned king james he stunned and killed any servant or figure that crossed his path all the while dragging the king with him king james struggled as best he could in his paralysis as voldemort maliciously made his way up staircases and down corridors finally voldemort stopped he had reached his destination and king james eyes widened in horror as he realized where voldemort had gone to the nursery voldemort slammed king james against the opposite wall of the nursery door making certain that james had a perfect seat to see what he had in store voldemort blasted the nursery double doors open and a loud shriek echoed from it queen lily in her arms she clutched her son of one year and three months harry voldemort sneered milady how wonderful it is to see you he drawled in his cold voice and who might this be young prince harry queen lily eyes expanded as she watched voldemort fix his eyes upon her son trying her best to conceal him from the monster before her she quickly began to move away as she did so she noticed james limp body against the wall across the hall what have you done to him she demanded without taking his eyes off of harry he sneered oh him he said nodding his head behind him just a simple paralysis spell nothing too harmful dontworry then his evil smirk faded away now give me the boy he demanded but when lily went to reach for her wand voldemort hit her directly in the chest with the expelliarmus charm she flew backward her wand falling to her far right landing hard with a loud whimper she had managed to protect young harry from any harm although he had started to cry quite loudly quickly lily tucked harry behind her shielding him from voldemort view lily looked in horror as voldemort began to advance on her accio wand she yelled but before she could grasp it voldemort had caught it now now your majesty i had hoped we could have done this devoid of any struggle but seeing that you are so adamant perhaps pain would suit you best voldemort looked down to her with his merciless red blood eyes crucio voldemort watched with content as her body racked with waves of intense pain her blood curdling screams echoed throughout the halls and silent tears fell from james eyes as he watched helplessly as his beloved wife was tortured before him he mentally struggled against his physical bonds but the spell wouldntgive finally voldemort lifted the attack and lily panted and shook weakly as she got up off of the floor she turned to harry who sat beside her still slightly crying now give me the boy he said softly but deadly but lily didn t instead she placed one hand on harry stomach and another on the back of his head and began to chant at first it was inaudible but she gradually got louder calling out the incantation to her spell lily and harry bodies began to glow with a soft scarlet glow as she continued with her spell voldemort now quite vexed yelled in fury he pointed his wand at lily and hurled her across the room with a sickening thud she hit the wall she slid down to the floor weakly at first both he and james thought she had been knocked out but then she slowly lifted her head to look at voldemort she tried to move but the pain from the impact of the wall and the cruciatus curse combined left her body aching but in truth the spell she had done to harry had left her void of any strength voldemort then turned his attention to harry once more he heard a soft whimper float behind him but know the queen hadntany more energy left in her body to move a muscle he then raised his want to harry a sound of struggling came from the doorway and he realized that the paralysis charm must be wearing off of the king no matter this will only take a moment he thought as he uttered the most deadly of curses before the child avada kedavra he called james had just broken free of the spell and had leapt to his feet to protect his son when he heard voldemort call out that horrible curse he froze no he thought numbly harry he watched helplessly as time seemed to slow down torturing him as a bolt of blinding green light shot from voldemort murderous wand straight at his son but suddenly miraculously when he thought it was all over for his family he watched as the green light unexpectedly rebounded off of his little boy and shot directly at its conjurer voldemort anguished screams boomed throughout the castle a horrible hissing sound was heard and suddenly james watched as a grayish ghostlike wisp of smoke filtered out through the folds of voldemort fallen robes as it emerged a horrible wail of agony was heard james stood in the doorway stunned and the wisp of smoke rammed mercilessly into james as it went to flee from the castle james was throw across the hall by the impact and watched as the ghostlike figure whirled away then quickly he rushed into the nursery lily harry are you alright he called as he entered his wife was lying helplessly in a heap of dress folds against the wall harry wails of fear and pain resonated throughout the room harry lily called weakly james quickly ran over to his son and held him tightly to him then ran over to his wife side when he pulled harry away from his chest he noticed a small trickle of blood run from his forehead and down the side of his small head james quickly applied pressure to the wound it ok son he said soothingly it alright he then turned his attention to lily her face was pale and her eyes dull and brimmed with tears a small weak smile formed as she looked into her husband eyes james she spoke softly where harry he is right here he replied handing over his son she hugged him close and silent tears began to stream rapidly down her young face lily take care of him james she interjected take care of him for me tell him i loved him james not liking the direction of the conversation cupped her face in her hands and tried to soothe her what are you talking about he asked shakily james i not going to make she started stop it you re going to be fine everything is going to be alright lily he told her as tears began to run down his own cheeks now harry had calmed down and was lying against her chest james looked to harry and stroked his ebony hair his son lily son lily he looked back up to lily he loved her so much he caressed her face lovingly she and harry meant the world to him james she whispered as she touched his cheek she looked despairingly into his eyes i love you and with that her small delicate hand slowly drifted toward the floor james watched in horror as her emerald eyes closed and her head lolled over as she drifted out of consciousness just then sirius and remus flew into the room james is everything alright yelled sirius a long bloody gash on his right cheek all the death eaters fled and but he never finished his sentence for he had seen the unconscious lily lily whispered remus in shock he too sported a gash on his face starting above his right eye over the bridge of his nose and ending below his left eye on his cheekbone thankfully his wasntserious quickly without listening to either of then james took hold of harry and handed him over to sirius take harry and follow me he told sirius he then slipped a hand around lily waist and another under her knees and lifted her resting her head upon his chest they raced up to the hospital wing as fast as they could sirius still applying pressure to harry small forehead hours later after the arrival of james most trusted adviser and hogwarts headmaster dumbledore and his trusted mediwitch madame pomfrey lily began to show signs of consciousness james had not once left her side and was now sitting in a chair beside her rocking a sleepy bandaged harry in his arms the cut on his forehead was fairly deep and would permanently scar but thankfully it wasnttoo deep for stitchings james came a weak voice beside him lily he called as he moved closer to lily she began to stir a little and slowly opened her eyes she smiled a frail little smile but it lit up her face all the same thank merlin you re alright he said as he sat gently beside her harry still in his arms she struggled to sit up but her weak arms couldntsupport her weight that was when she realized where she was the hospital wing james what happened she asked as james magically made the head of the bed bend forward making it easy for her to sit up he looked to her strangely dontyou remember suddenly all the memories came flooding back to her james watched as realization dawned on her oh my god she exclaimed her hand clasped against her mouth harry is he alright yes dear he is right here and james handed harry over to his mother lily hugged him tightly and kissed his head softly but how she managed to get out i mean the curse how did he survive it because of you came a voice from behind the king dumbledore it was because of the spell you had preformed on little harry that saved him but it was a simple shielding charm it wasntstrong enough to block a curse such as that countered lily ah but what you dontunderstand is the power behind the actual spell the intention the bond between a mother and her child and the desperation behind the spell that was what protected him dumbledore replied in his deep soothing voice magic is an unpredictable complicated force it has yet to be understood even by the greatest of wizards and you and your son are proof of that but professor what of voldemort asked james is he dead what happened dumbledore just sighed i am afraid i cannot answer that question your highness and for that i am sorry james sighed as well and looked to lily and harry there and then he vowed never to allow such a thing to ever plague his family again he would rebuild his kingdom to be the strongest most heavily feared kingdom of the four kingdoms no matter what it took and that he would destroy any who posed a threat against his family or kingdom ever again fhew that was long this is just the prologue only written as a base hope you like the next chapter thanx

his birthday is now before hers i know that in the books hermione is older but i changing it everyone else is the same age as they would normally be harry and hermione were married on september 28 also hermione in this story is not a muggleborn witch i know that is a big part of the hermione we all know but she had to be the princess of ravenclaw somehow so she has become the daughter of a pureblood and a muggle a half blood harry though is considered a pureblood because he is the son of a pureblood and a muggle born witch since both his parents are actually magical his mother heritage is not considered now on with the story xxxxxxxxxx chapter fifteen what to do gryffindor takes action xxx hermione are you sure i mean if you arent ready if you need more time then but hermione stopped him she placed her fingers upon his lips to quiet him as she smiled softly harry shut up her statement caught him off guard but he quickly smirked as he pulled her into him again his hands roamed her body freely as hers found their way up his tunic he continued to massage her body with his hands as he monopolized her mouth after what seemed like forever harry broke apart from her hermione pouted and he laughed she asked him why he had stopped and he only smirked what you miss me already he played she reddened as she arched her back her chest against his chest indicating that she wanted more he smirked as he licked her lips as you wish he whispered barely she couldnt stop her blush and she couldnt stop her body either it worked on its own though she wasnt objecting harry then touched her side and she whimpered when he kissed just above the spot where her pulse resided hermione he waited for her reply but all he received were soft pants hermione yes she gasped he smirked as he began to kiss his way down her chest above the fabric of her dress he lifted his head back to her ear and whispered i love you with that said he reached his hand behind her back and pulled gently on the soft satin ribbon that strapped her dress and he was now about to show her exactly how much he loved her xxx the sun warm rays gently filtered through the royal bed chamber of the prince of gryffindor and his wife the scarlet golden rays lit up the room basking the room in a welcoming warmth the sound of the morning bell rang soundly as the gryffindorian prince roused from his peaceful sleep his eyes blinked a few times to adjust to the light before he yawned contentedly he shifted his weight softly under the silken sheets as he stretched out his legs and back a smile never left his lips as he tightened his hold on the sleeping beauty in his arms her hair was sprawled softly behind her and under him as it tickled his chest softly when she moved he groaned when he couldnt see her face as her back was pressed to his chest tightly he was however content with the feel of her soft flesh against his her warmth sent tingles down his chest and lower abdomen and butterflies danced freely within him smiling he snuggled in closer to her as he nuzzled her neck her skin was so soft and he fought the urge to awaken her then and there and take her as his once more at this his smile grew as he decided that later would be a better time once more he gripped her close he couldnt seem to bring her close enough to him and he constantly pulled her near he again nuzzled her neck and inhaled the soft scent of cinnamon and vanilla her scent made his blood flood down to his lower half as he rubbed her stomach adoringly as he laid there his head fuzzy with sleep once more he thought back on all of the times she had brought smiles to his features she was an amazing person he was honored to confess she had the softest heart and the largest smile sure she would get in her know it all moods but he found that more and more attractive the more he got to know her he didnt understand the feelings he would feel everytime he was around her it used to confuse him but he always felt so calmed when around her he felt as if he had been beside her his entire life she made him feel different than ever before it wasnt something he could explain it was just there and his love for her sprung up on him suddenly but the more he thought about it the more he would realize that he always loved her she had taken him from the start and harry began to find himself starting to forget of the dark beauty he once chased after hermione brought him ease comfort and laughter he felt he could tell her anything and that any secret or confession would be safe with her he was in love with her and it made his heart soar when he knew she wanted him too he loved her content with the thoughts in his head harry slowly closed his eyes as he buried his nose in the crook of her neck he slowly began to drift back to sleep as he felt his wife shift gently against his body hermione was the first to stir a few hours later as birds twittered happily outside their large windows she softly moaned in a tired voice and opened her chocolate orbs to the room for a moment she just laid there staring unfocusedly at the beautiful wash basin and cream pitcher that sat atop an antique end table upon the opposite wall her mind was still foggy from her latest dream which was wonderful in her opionion and her mind was heavy with sleep she went to stretch her legs and chest when a sharp pain shot through her lower abdomen she winced as suddenly her sleepy memory awoke with images of the night before a large blush painted her cheeks as a smile made its way upon her lips she couldnt help but smile at what her memory was replaying for her as soft butterflies awoke within her abdomen she then slid her hands down beneath the soft silk sheet that covered her form and met a large warm arm blocking her path again she smiled her face glowing as she ran her hands up and down his muscular arm the arm pulled her close to the body behind her and memories of the first night they had spent together flooded her already working mind she found his fingers plastered against her bare stomach and she made to intertwine her fingers with his she giggled softly as he sighed in his sleep and she turned herself slightly at the waist so that she could reach his upperarm with her lips she placed soft feather like kisses upon his strong arms as she gingerly began to turn her body to face him when she had finally gotten her heavily wrapped body to face her husband she smiled as he pulled her closer yet again sighing happily she snuggled into him her arms around his waist and a soft blush remained upon her cheeks as she felt his unclothed body press against hers oh honestly hermione he is your husband and you ve crossed the line with him yelled a voice in her head why are you still shy arond him hermione didnt know why she felt so shy before him now but she did she sighed and suppressed her childish feelings as her fingers softly traced themselves down his side up his stomach and to his healing chest the wound was healed from its cuts and gashes but the bruises from broken ribs and damaged veins were just starting to fade having turned a healthy greenish yellow color in the place of the bloody wound that looked so much like his father s was a large reddish scar it started from his breastbone and expanded out in a large circle of scar tissue the club he had been hit with had done a great job at tearing right through his chest muscles hermione traced her soft fingers down his chest once more feeling the different textures of his soft unwounded flesh to his rubbery soft flesh of his scar tissue she felt his insides concave beneath her fingers as she came to the conclusion that she found a ticklish spot she made a mental note to experiment with it later but for now she was content in looking lovingly at the man before her as she thought back to the first time she met him at their wedding as she sat there in thought her fingers still gently caressing his chest she shivered when she felt the soft nails of the hand that was sprawled across her back scratch against her back ticklilishly as it balled into a fist only to open again gently tickiling her she smiled and looked up at the face of the prince before her and saw green emeralds staring back at her morning she said lightly she watched him smile as his fingers gently massaged the small of her back she sighed contently and closed her eyes she opened them again to feel his forehead press itself softly against hers as his nose touched hers as well morning was all he whispered as he captured her lips she didnt protest as he softly pushed her shoulder back turning her onto her back as he went to hover above her her hands quickly found his hair as his hands massaged her sides again as he gently tickled her with his nails she would giggle into the kiss as he deepened it expertly they stayed that way for a few moments before harry hands found a stow away piece of clothing resting beneath his wife he gently tugged at it and hermione responded by arching her back fluidly she heard him groan as her chest made contact with his at first she feared she may have hurt him due to his still sore wound but quickly blushed in her incorrect conclusion as she felt his arrousal press against her harry quickly removed the article of clothing his tunic from beneath her and left it to lay upon the bed forgotten his hands found her hips and he gripped them tightly as she moaned suddenly as harry prepared to love his wife a blasted knock was heard at the door followed closely by the soft voice of the servant calling his name harry groaned in annoyance as he broke away from the kiss he was so enjoying hermione giggled as he twisted his torso above her to look at the closed door he softly dropped his hips to the mattress as he answered the servants call yes what is it he yelled in aggravation the servant began to open the door and hermione eeped and pulled the sheets abover her as harry eyes widened dont come in here he yelled as he balled up the discarded tunic and threw it at the servant the servant quickly retreated and closed the door before him all the while blushing like crazy so sorry your highness so sorry he appologized repeatedly harry glowered as hermione couldnt suppress her giggles yea yea what is it harry said his annoyance only intensifying at the stuttering of the servant he was interupted from hermione for this oh yes sorry your highness harry just growled in his throat as hermione touched his chest to calm him yes umm the king wishes to speak to you in his bed chambers and he asks that you prepare yourself quickly screamed the servant through the door harry was confused at this and furrowed his brow prepare myself for what he called back prepare yourself for the meeting this morning the delegates from the four kingdoms are scheduled to be here at noon replied the servant i believe your father wishes you to take his place at the meeting this afternoon harry nodded and thanked the servant he listened to the servant as his footsteps were heard retreating from his door harry then turned his attention back to his young wife as he leaned upon his arm he smiled as he pressed a protective hand upon her stomach and leaned his body slightly over hers as he stared into her eyes hermione smiled at him comforted by his closeness she raised her hand up to trace his muscles with her finger as she refused to break eye contact with the prince so she started you have to leave she asked him softly yep he replied as he smiled then he bent down as his hand snaked around her waist and he seized her lips he made to continue out the acts he was planning on before he was so rudely interuppted but hermione giggled as she pushed him away harry pouted at her actions as he pulled away from the kiss harry she scolded playfully harry continued to pout whadya do that for he demanded sounding like a spoiled kid hermione had to giggle at his adorable face as she pushed on his chest knocking him back onto his hips and side because she emphasized you have to go speak to your father before attending that meeting at noon harry just continued to frown as he made to kiss her again harry she giggled stop you havent got much time now just look at the sun harry she said in what she hoped would sound like a stern voice but unfortunately for her the gling in her eyes gave her away harry hand just traveled southward and slightly grazed her inner thigh and his nails grazed her flesh softly as his hand made its way back up to her stomach hermione shivered as she fought the urge to guide his hand else where harry she rasped he only smiled as he lowered his head to her she was sure he was going to kiss her before his lips turned toward her ear he softly nibbled her earlobe before whispering softly in it you like that huh hermione just panted softly as she tired to regain her composure she didnt like loosing total control of her body but at times knowing harry had the upperhand turned her on even more and this was one of them huh hermione do you like that he asked her again as his hand went back to graze her inner thigh she gasped as her body stiffened she could feel harry smirk against her neck as he tortured her softy answer me mione she tried to deny it but her body wouldnt let her get away with it her small pants and her stiff body gave her away easily hermione yes she confessed breathlessly harry smirk widened as he gently tormented her finally when hermione was sure harry was going to continue he suddenly pulled his hand away kissed her lips quickly and stood from the bed hermione almost screamed in frustration as she sat up watching him make his way to his wardrobe a blush made its way across her nose as she was hit with a nice view of his backside she placed her hand above her stomach as she tried to quell the rampant butterflies that tickled her endlessly her body ached for him and she silently cursed him for leaving her like this harry harry only smirked as he entered the bathroom ahh he knew he was in for it later but it would all work out in the end xxx after a nice shower and a good meal the two made their way toward the king chambers they were announced much to harry annoyance and allowed in to see the wounded king harry frowned at his father appearence his face was still pale and his eyes drooped in exhaustion at the moment he was pressed into his many pillows as he was the night before as he ate his breakfast to the company of his mother hermione smiled at them as she held on tighter to harry arm harry couldnt suppress the smile that came to him from feeling her there in return he laced his fingers through hers as he quickly kissed her temple before his parents would notice he then pulled her into the bed chamber of the king good morning father mother he said as he leaned over and kissed his mother cheek lily smiled and stood up from her seat beside her husband as harry made to sit the king and prince began their discussion as lily then made her way to were hermione stood not too far behind about a second later serenity entered the chambers as well with li at her side and her father right behind my my hermione dont you look ravishing this morning complimented serenity in a soft voice hermione blushed deeply at the same moment noticing serenity lack of energy hermione mumled a small thanks as serenity continued to smile widely queen lily smile not much smaller you re positively glowing hermione couldnt contain her blush her cheeks burned with a fire she thought would incinerate her body serenity smiled knowingly and leaned into li tiredly as she sent the queen a wink sirius made his way over to his best friend and godson as remus lupin entered the chambers from a door that hid itself behind a large tapestry and a wall like door he carried scrolls dials and other mechanical devices in his arms and small pouch at his side as he too made his way to the king james we are ready the delegates will be apparating shortly james nodded and turned back to his son ok harry are you sure you are ok with this i put my complete faith in you my son i know you are now ready to take control of this kingdom harry nodded and couldnt put into words how he felt at that moment the honor of his father placing his complete trust in him was more than he could comprehend again harry nodded and after discussing a few more issues that needed to be addressed at the meeting harry stood up and bent over to place a kiss upon his father forehead he then turned to leave sirius and remus by his side he walked up to hermione who stood with his mother and serenity and smiled he offered his arm to hermione who took it graciously and he and the others made there way to the conference halls when they had arrived every delegate had arrived also and were waiting patiently for the prince to present himself hermione could feel harry nervousness wash over him and she held him closer she touched his chest and took his attention you are going to do great in there remember you are in charge you are your father heir and you are the future king of gryffindor you are ready to do this i know you are hermione told him softly harry smiled and inhaled deeply not once breaking eye contact with the princess presenting his royal highness the crowned prince harry of gryffindor said the announcer at the double doors to the conference hall he banged his large heavy staff upon the marble floors as he announced their presence at this harry stepped forward with hermione upon his arm and presenting her royal highness the crowned princess hermione of gryffindor it felt awkward at first to be presented as a princess of gryffindor but hermione felt pleased at her title she would become the queen of gryffindor ravenclaw beside harry one day just thinking of her being beside harry made her feel a certain warmth in the pit of her stomach she listened as the others behind her were announced as harry pulled her in to the hall as harry entered the conference room with hermione upon his arm he turned and ceremoniously greeted the top officials in the room as he finished he pulled hermione seat out for her to sit as li did the same for serenity followed by remus for the queen when the women were seated the other men took there seats as they all prepared for a tedious and strenuous afternoon xxx listen rorick if we leave the western lands unprotected then yelled a portly manin his 50 to the delegate before him we ve heard all of this before hansburg retorted another man seemingly in his mid 40 s as he made to quell the argument between the men named hansburg and rorick right now we need to focus on who is attacking us before we venture into where am i right your highness he asked as he turned to harry harry who had been watching the men verbal battle with a working mind turned to the man who had addressed him yes lancey i agree he said as he reworked the arguments in his head he sighed and ran a hand through his messy tresses but your highness we know who the attackers are they hansburg thank you but at the moment i dont wish to discuss defenses not until everybody here knows exactly who it is we are defending from said harry in a superior tone hermione looked over at him and smiled softly serenity who was now standing not too far from the prince chair closed her eyes for a moment and smiled in pride harry would make a fine king now what do we know of these attackers what evidence has been left behind i want to know their form of attacks their dress their choice of words all of it tell me everything you know of these men the next few hours went on like this a lot of valuable information was given within this time and everybody now felt they had a good amount of information concerning the assailants nobody doubted for a moment that these men and perhaps women were death eaters followers in the footsteps of voldemort the late king of slytherin now under the direction of their new king lucius malfoy they were wreaking havoc on the remaining three kingdoms destroying what ever they could whoever they could the were ruthless powerful monsters who shot unforgivable curses in every direction aiming and killing any and all wizards that opposed their beliefs harry now juggled this information as he contemplated what he should do so far they knew that these death eaters were genocidal wanting to purify the wizarding race of all muggle borns he found it hypocrytical though intriguing that half breeds werentincluded in this he was glad though for if they had his wife would be subject to their torture but what did worry him was that his mother was a muggle born they also knew that these death eaters were targeting the stronger cities first attacking trading routes merchant carriages and market squares they attacked areas that were heavily populated and close to borders their attacks were almost as if they were all teasers they didnt kill all but would mortally wound many and purposely leave them and torture the rest just for the fun of it torture was their game and they loved it never did they cringe when they called out a killing curse on the contrary they would laugh and applaude they would pull their black hoods down further upon their heads then cackle insanely they dressed in all black cloaks and wandered in the shadows never did they group into many but somehow they always found each other when they were ready to strike and kill this disgusted harry to no end these were disgusting monsters and they deserved to pay royally for what they were doing to these people to his father harry sat back a troubling dark look on his face as he stared into the cracking fire across the long table at which he sat at the head hermione had just finished settling a heated dispute brought on again by hansburg and rorick when she noticed harry mood the hairs on the back of her neck almost stood on end at the intese look on his face and she knew what he was thinking revenge she reached out and took a gentle hold of his hand he didnt look up from his intese gaze at the fire but is fingers did wrap around hers lovingly as if he was thanking her for being there beside him she ran her thumb over the top of his hand reassuringly serenity saw this and smiled she then decided to bring up another subject so that it might bring harry out of his thoughts gentlemen now that all the info concerning the physicallity of these attackers is known perhaps it would be good to to move on i was looking over the different attack points and i was shocked to discover she started but was then cut off by the angry voice of hansburg with all do respect your highness but i dont really understand why it is that you attend these meetings you are an elven princess yet i dont see the assistance of said elves at all please mi lady tell us why is it you see it is your duty to attend when you clearly bring us no aid serenity was quite taken aback at this comment she felt a pang of hurt as she was deeply insulted be it so that she was indeed pained by his accusation she decided not to show it however sirius harry and li thought otherwise sirius immediately rose to his feet in blinded anger and remus hissed at him to keep his head meanwhile serenity was holding on to li arm as he growled at the pudgy man before him in obvious rage hansburg was obviously intimidated immediately by the threatening daggers that seemed to shoot his way from all three men harry blood boiled as he thought back on how his best friend had saved his hide more than once and had just now risked her very life to save his father s how dare he what yelled sirius emil how dare you say that to my daughter i swear i would rip your tongue straight from your mouth if daddy yelled serenity harry could see the hidden tears behind her eyes and the pained expression made harry secretly root sirius on with his threat but serenity on the other hand seemed quite calm she took a few deep breaths before she turned to look at the man who had accused her wrongly i am sorry you feel that way sir hansburg but i have to tell you that you are quite mistaken hansburg looked at with an eyebrow raised and a funny expression on his face serenity voice was calm and even and it had a strange firmness an edge to it harry knew she wasnt going to let him get away with insulting her that easily now for starters it would be best to not speak on matters you know not of your ignorance will only make you look like a fool also concerning the elves i have no control over that issue the elves refuse on their own accord though i am working quite hard to resolve that matter she told the man her eyes burned with a fire and harry admired her hermione too saw the fire burning in her eyes and was amazed at how calm she could be yet how moving at the same moment hermione had to smile at li who unyielding attention to his princess never strayed at the moment his eyes were glued to her face as a look of amazement flashed through his eyes unfortuantely this look vanished quickly but hermione had seen it and it made her feel at ease now normally i do not allow comments such as yours to affect me but when you accuse me of not bringing any aid to the kingdom which i have tried so hard to assist at any time i cannot sit back and allow you to continue here is where your ignorance shows itself you might not be aware that currently i have many elves waiting to arrive here at this very moment to help with the speedy reconstruction of the castle nor do you know of the assistance i provided in capturing the death eaters a few weeks back so if you would be so kind sir hansburg just keep your attention focused on fussing over your city border problems other than that do now sit here and accuse me of not aiding my kingdom you do forget i too am a witch and i too consider myself a gryffindorian hermione couldnt help but smile at serenity little speech it appeared that sirius remus queen lily and li were also pleased at how serenity chose to retaliate hermione smiled again when she noticed the smug smirk upon li face as serenity leaned back into him for support she had decided to stand though hermione knew not why and serenity was starting to look slightly weak when hermione turned to look at harry she noticed that he was the only one not smiling he was furious hansburg might i remind you he started cooly that had it not been for princess serenity last night my father your king would be dead keep that in mind all of you the next time you decide to criticize her the room was quiet and nobody moved as to not upset their prince further while hansburg face had gone a stark white serenity looked to harry with a certain softness in her eyes and a growing smile upon her lips she then chose that moment to clear her throat well now that that is over and done with as i was saying earlier after i had looked over the different attack points i was quite shocked to discover that each and every attack point held a significance in voldemort reign 20 years ago the first attack which happened on the trade route where the three roads meet was the very spot the first attack had started all those years ago now if you look at these points here you ll remember the significance behind them as well she said she then walked over to the extremely large tapestry map that hung behind harry chair at the head of the table everyone heads turned as they followed serenity harry too turned his chair slightly as he watched her pull her wand out from her dressfolds as she reached the tapestry she waved her hand and suddenly dozens of red dots filled the map each dot indicates an attack in the past few months she started smoothly she pointed at the map with her wand at one dot in particular here is where the head auror macaurthor and his wife were murdered along with half the order this is also a significant spot here where the dark mark made its first appearence and here serenity went on to distingish each and ever attack point until her wand made its way to gryffindor castle harry stomach gave a lurch as his scar began to sting this shocked harry as his scar had never hurt in the past he rubbed his scar in confusion and noticed hermione place her fingers upon her temple she rubbed her temples softly as she continued to watch serenity with interest and here gentlemen is where voldemort started serenity while pointing to the gryffindor castle attacked harry finished hermione serenity as well as the others looked to the princess serenity smiled solemnly and nodded sirius and remus looked over at queen lily who had a somber expression seated upon her features they knew what she was thinking how she had almost her son harry life as well as her own and james they knew she still felt the pain from the cruciatus curse and still suffered from nightmares concerning that night they watched as tears lined bottom of her emerald eyes as her breathing began to quicken yes precisely that was the biggest blow the light side had dealt the dark side the death of their great leader voldemort a shudder went throughout the room but serenity shrugged it off in an annoyed sigh i believe their recent attack on the castle itself was a way of saying that they were planning on hitting gryffindor good this means war to them and it is not something to be taken lightly so do not take these attacks lightly i have a feeling that there is going to be a big battle coming soon but your highness started rorick the only real threat to us was not he who must not be named legion of mongrels but was he who must not be named himself now that he is dead this time the war should be simple to overcome he stated everyone was in agreement and serenity looked at them incredilously along with queen lily remus harry hermione sirius and li but you are wrong came serenity reply the other men looked at her he is not dead far from it he is very much alive and he is gaining his strength that is why we must hit him and hit him hard xxx it was later on that night and harry had returned to his father chambers to inform him of the day many discussions while hermione sat within their room running the day many conversations over in her head voldemort was still alive i knew this but that means harry she thought sadly she was worried about him she knew the battle that he was inevitably going to be apart of voldemort wanted to exact his revenge upon gryffindor but more so upon the potters wringing her skirt hermione stared deep into the fire before her as it cracked and popped with heat she was scared very scared she didnt want to loose her family her husband tears welled in her eyes and a constricting pain shot through her heart and stomach a knot formed in her throat and she could feel the blood coursing through her entire body her body throbbed and she felt sick if i loos harry i dont now what i ll do if i loose him suddenly she stood up as she shook her head of these thoughts tears now running freely down her cheeks as her throat ached come on hermione dont think like this everything will be fine harry isnt going to go anywhere the light side will defeat this threat hermione sighed as she turned to the balcony she needed air as she gently walked through the soft white curtains she sighed heavily the chill wind felt cool upon her tear stained face the smell of the ocean filled her senses even though it was some miles awa she could still smell the crispness of the salty waters it was a little after sunset and the velvety purple sky blanketed the world the stars heaven candles flickered mischievously as they twinkled down upon the world below them hermione stared up into the sky as her tears subsided and her breathing returned to normal she just stood there for how long she didnt know but she enjoyed the stillness of the night it calmed her and brought peace to her mind if only for a moment it made her nerves relax and her mind calm it self staring at the stars feeling the wind and smelling the fresh air always calmed her in ravenclaw she used to sit along the ocean shore and listen as the waves crashed upon the wet sand she would even go and stand and await the icy waters to glide atop her feet it was what calmed her quieted her she now had the stars to keep her company as she allowed the last of her tears to fall before stopping she went over to lean against the cold stone of the balcony railing as she stared down upon the inner courtyard of the castle from this angle she could see the part of the destroyed eastern wing her thoughts then drifted back to what serenity had said earlier concerning the large number of elves that were waiting to come to gryffindor aid in rebuilding the castle she smiled as serenity was right it was but two hours ago that the faction of elves had arrived ready and willing to aid in the reconstruction of their princess beloved uncle hermione was thrilled and took pleasure in seeing the expression upon the delegates faces as they watched the elves arrive in a multitude they had started almost immediatly and the wing was starting to look even more grand than it had ever looked before hermione enjoyed these elves they were extremely courteous and held a sort of old world charm about them they were humorous and graceful and their skill and swiftness in their work surprised everybody they were beautiful creatures with glowing skin and gem like eyes they seemed to have an inner light to them their smiles were genuine and warm and their demeanor was calm and mysterious very alluring these creatures were with their charm and mystery and hermione enjoyed watching them as hermione stood there her thoughts bent upon the captivating race the swish of steel slicing through air cought her attention as she turned her attention to the roofless training hall she was surprised to see a figure shrouded in shadow and candlelight battle an imaginary foe as it cut the air before them it wasnt until hermione saw the long trailing ponytail of hair did she recognize the figure to be serenity hermione watched as the elven princess continued to slice the air before her in awe her movements were graceful and delicately poised as her hair danced behind her in it low ribbon she moved switly as if the weight of the large sword in her hand were weightless her movements were fast as light with fluid swishes of the metal weapon and her feet barely touched the floor as she danced with her sword hermione sight was slighly limited due to the height of the balcony and the ground level training hall but what hermione could see of the princess was nothing short of amazing she especially liked what she could see of her dress her dress was what hermione guessed to be elven training attire since she had never seen it before xxx serenity attire was a dark sleeveless silk top with a low diamond cut neckline and intricate embroidered designs that hugged her body at the waist a deep burgundy sash repeatedly wrapped tightly around her holding the top in the top continued down as it split at the sides and two large panels of fabric came down from under the burgundy sash one covering the front of her legs the other covering the back it almost looked like a dress with a sash around her waist with her slits going all the way up to her waist at the bottom of the panels the same embroidered pattern swirled at the corner they were of burgundy cherry blossoms the same pattern that designed the top beneath the panels of cloth she wore a pair of dark baggy pants with dark slippers she stood in the middle of the training hall a thin layer of sweat glistening in the starlight as she continued to swipe her sword against her invisible foe she twirled and jabbed her reflexes amazing her hair trailed behind her as a thick trail of auburn the sword caught the light of the moon hanging above as an other worldly glow was cast upon it it was almost as if it was taking in the glow of hte moon literally its glow was of a pure light bright and warm as it shone with brilliance serenity continued her dance with her sword as she twirled gracefully with each swipe of her deadly weapon a melancholy song sang throughout the hall it would travel through the night air as its song filled the night sky serenity focused on her companion song as she continued to whirl to its melody a shadowed figure watched her with pure amazement he wathced as her eyes filled with determination as she trained herself pushing her to be her best her fastest her strongest her eyes burned with a fire that enticed him he longed for her as she danced the flaps of fabric hanging from her twirling around her body making her seem enchanting her slippers tapped softly against the wooden floors as she continued on he knew she couldnt sense him because her sole attention was drawn into her sword and he smiled good as serenity spun to her right she was shocked when the blade of her sword sang as it clanged against another blade at first she was shocked and she froze her eyes wide as she stared into the cloaked figure before her he stood tall before her his right arm and sword extended high as it blocked the oncoming attack of the princess she could sense him smirk and watched as he pulled his hood back with his left serenity smirked as she realized exactly who it was li in a swift smooth movement li was able to lower her extended arm that held the sword asking her eyes a simple question she smiled and laughed as she excepted his challenge within seconds she retaliated causing him to step back though not off guard he had expected it the two continued to spar gently showing the other the power of their attacks serenity was quite the swordswoman as she easily blocked and maneuvered around him their spar was more like a teasing game not really aiming to win the two merely enjoyed this and considered it a form of flirtation it was until suddenly li began to add a bit more force into his attacks and serenity began to strike back with equal force the entire time during their little spar their eyes never left the other meaningful glances were shot at each other and looks of longing desire adoration and love were all mingled in with each glance finally with a single blow li knocked serenity sword out of her hand she was shocked at first but then smirked soft loose tendrels framed her face as her eyes sparkled merlin she beautiful he thought as he stared at her she smiled softly as she made her way towards him she swayed her hips until she made to stand right befor him staring at him lovingly she peered deeply into his amber eyes her eyes held so much emotion that it made li blood race he gently felt her hand touch his right hand as she ran her nails against his knuckles she then grabbed his hand though not once breaking eye contact with the man before her as she did this she slowly leaned into him her eyes searching his as she began to lean upward towards him it wasnt until a second after did he realize her true intentions with in secods serenity had yanked li sword from his hand and tossed it across the hall then she suddenly dropped herself to the floor as she made to swipe his feet from under her li however reacted just in time to leap backwards in time to miss her sweeping leg serenity smirked as she leapt to her feet you really are the strongest guardian of our time she commented it was li turn to smirk as he cocked his head to the side only to protect you your highness with that he lunged forward arm extended as serenity leapt back this began their next round of sparring shorn of weapons as their only means of attack were their arms legs and speed as they fought serenity smirked as she knew li would never strike her she knew he purposely missed her by mere inches as he threw punches and kicks at her she too refused to hit him thought she knew he would withstand it finally serenity decided to aim for her sword as she was now tired playing in one fluid movement serenity was able to leap towards her sword as she landed gracefully beside it li too aimed for his sword once in his hand he ran to her and she ran to him they both met in the middle of the hall as the hall resonated with the clang of the two swords meeting a few good blows were dealt and suddenly serenity found herself for a second with her back to li and his back to hers instantly the two both turned to their rights and thier swords met once again in a loud melody of union once again the sound of the metal reverberated along the walls and left a soft echo lifting into the night the two sparring partners both stood there their swords still held together their bodies in the same positon as they were when they stopped each one breathing hard and raggedly serenity was the first to move as a trace of a very small smile began to spread across her lips her eyes intense and locked directly onto li s his eyes were mesmerizing and he was mesmerized by hers as well his eyes called to her and she knew what he was yearning for he stood there panting as he watched her lips begin to spread with a smile it was then that he lost his control as quick as lighning li dropped his sword to the floor as serenity did the same before the two met in the middle meeting with an intese kiss li had cupped the back of her neck and wrapped his hands around her waist as he pulled her to him he needed her to hold her to touch her he had missed her so bad and his lips yearned to touch hers the kiss in the hospital wing was the first kiss he was able to give her since he didnt know when serenity was in heaven as her lips met his it had been so long since their last kiss before the one in the hospital wing and since then serenity couldnt seem to get him out of her mind concentrating on anything other than him was proving to be difficult the two stood there in an ancient old embrace as they expressed their love for each other serenity only wished her world could except their love for she needed him beside her he meant everything to her and with him he gave her strength and a new found power she never knew she could tap she needed him it was that simple she wasnt half the elven witch she could be without him li deepened the kiss as he pulled her flush against him he smiled into the kiss as he felt her hands bury themselves in his hair she felt like heaven in his arms he wanted her so bad to be his for ever he knew then that he would die fighting for her his heart would never and could never be given to anyone else he would always belong to the elven princess and he would fight for his right to love her no matter what the consequences were he had made his resolve a long time ago he would die battling for her finally as a cool breeze swept between the embracing couple the need for air panged their chests li reluctantly pulled away but refused to let her go far as he still held her flush agianst him his head pressed against hers his eyes burning with a passion that made her stomach flip she loved that look in his eyes and it always made her body react to him in the same way as he held her both their minds refused to work not wanting to break the soft and sensual aura that had wrapped around them they both knew a moment like this and a chance like this wouldnt arise again with the elves here their embraces were limited for they werent excepted by her people serenity looked up at li as tingles went down her spine and she wanted to never break apart from him i love you she whispered softly she didnt expect li to respond she just felt the need to express herself she felt his grip on her tighten as he leaned into her more and i love you he whispered just as soft serenity eyes widened as a large smile graced her lips her stomach did repeated flips and her cheeks flushed she then cupped the back of his neck nad pulled him in to her once more li smiled and could only oblige he didnt care at the moment at who could be watching or who may catch them he d deal with that later but for now all he wanted was to be with serenity xxx hermione watched from her high balcony a smile upon her lips as she cheered her friends on she knew their dilema and only hoped that it would soon be resolved for both their sakes hermione then pushed herself off of the balcony railing softly as she reverted her attention back to the night sky it was then that hermione heard the door to their room creak open as the hinges moved a loud click of the door closing was heard followed by the heavy footsteps of a tired prince hermione smiled but remained upon the balcony she knew he d come for her harry undid his heavy cloak from upon is shoulders and let it drop to the floor with a loud clank he then proceeded to remove some of his more formal robes and he unbuttoned his sleeves and half of his shirt the rest of his formal robes upon the ground in a heap of flashy medalions and such he stood in his undershirt half unbuttoned and his pants the rest of his attire long forgotten he made his way to the fire and smiled where is hermione then he turned to the billowing white curtians of the balcony entrance another smile met him as he walked over to see his wife he was right she was upon the balcony staring up at the stars and harry couldnt remember ever seeing a more beautiful sight her skin shone with the light of the moon as it accented her soft skin her hair shined with a glow that was purely hermione and her eyes sparkled harry then made to move behind her he smiled again as he wrapped his arms around her slim waist as she immediately relaxed into him giggling you were waiting for me i see he said in a low sultry voice this made hermione tingle as she closed her eyes to harry breath upon her neck he gave her a few soft kisses upon her neck as she leaned her back into him further harry then turned his attention down and saw the embracing couple in the training hall he smiled and turned his attention back to his young wife miss me hermione giggled as she turned her head to look up at him harry immediately captured her lips with his as his hands fingered the soft fabric that encased the princess before him hermione smiled and reached a hand up to touch his cheek they remained that way for a while before parting a while later for air they continued to stand there as they both stared at the night sky lost in their own thoughts before harry tugged on hermione pulling her into the room once more he led her to the sofa that before the fireplace and pulled her into his lap as he sat down she giggled before starting to run her hand through his hair as he stared into the dancing embers before him hermione watched him and she knew he was working through a few difficult issues over in his mind he squeezed tightly upon her waist and leaned into her touch as he battled for a way to tell her what he was now expected to do he didnt want to worry her but this was war and he had to protect her and his kingdom he sighed and pulled away from her as he looked up at her his eyes serious hermione remained quiet but questioned him with her own eyes hermione he started as he touched her cheek with the back of his fingers i afraid um he stopped he didnt know how to tell her hermione just touched his cheek and kissed his lips softly for reassurance it ok harry what is it harry sighed and nodded after i reported the events of the day to father we came to an equal decision that it would be best to release a band of aurors out to seize one of the suspected hide outs of the death eaters he started hermione nodded a questioning look still fogged her eyes as she watched his uneasyness that is good harry why do you seem so nervous she asked because you see he took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair as he turned to stare into the fire i have been appointed as the head of the band of aurors at this hermione gasped as a hand went to her mouth no she whispered harry quickly turned his attention from the fire before him to look into his wife eyes he could see the fear and worry that was building up inside of her and it hurt him he cupped her face and wrapped his arm around her waist protectively it going to be alright hermione i promise everything is going to be fine he tried to console her but he could already see tears threaten to fall she nodded softly as she searched his eyes she didnt want him to go but she knew he had to slowly she lowered her head to rest upon his shoulder and she clung to him he rubbed her back as he rocked her i sorry she looked up at him with a raised eyebrow why i sorry i have to leave you i dont want you to worry he told her hermione smiled and hugged him close dont be sorry this is your duty as the prince of gryffindor i couldnt be more proud of you she told him softly he smiled and felt at ease at her comment he hugged her close and kissed her head as he continued to rock her so when are you to leave i not sure yet we have some auror training we need to do to prepare the men and we still have to confirm the location of the hide out it may be a month or so but we ll be really busy during that time i afraid i wont be able to spend much time with you he said sadly hermione smiled and rubbed his chest softly that is ok i sure we ll find time for eachother but what of your wound it still hurts you are you gonna fight without fully healing she asked worriedly i have no choice if it refuses to heal quickly i ll be forced to fight with it but dont worry hermione i ll be alright he told her she nodded against him praying for his safety then she decided she didnt want to think about it anymore she smiled and grabbed a fistful of his tunic as she leaned back capturing his lips as she braught him down upon the sofa with her harry smiled as he allowed her to pull him down like she said they would have to find time for each other and now would be perfect xxx ok that is it for now lol it was funny earlier when i was working on the first part of the chapter my lil brother comes into my room and exclaims oh my god i know who harry gets married to at first i looked at him with a raised eyebrow then he elaborates he gets married to hermione i started to laugh poor

before hers i know that in the books hermione is older but i changing it everyone else is the same age as they would normally be harry and hermione were married on september 28 also hermione in this story is not a muggleborn witch i know that is a big part of the hermione we all know but she had to be the princess of ravenclaw somehow so she has become the daughter of a pureblood and a muggle a half blood oh and also seamus is also born to a wizard and a witch his mother being muggleborn harry though is considered a pureblood because he is the son of a pureblood and a muggle born witch since both his parents are actually magical his mother heritage is not considered now on with the story xxxxxxxxxx chapter eighteen is war approaching xxx hermione hermione are you ok she called out hermione groaned as she raised a hand to her head serenity laughed as she helped her friend up off of the grass and into a sitting position hermione i told you it isnt good to push yourself so far you ll only hurt yourself hermione laughed as well as she held her palm to her now throbbing forehead come on let get you home hermione stood up and closed her eyes for a moment allowing the circles in her head to cease sorry serenity i guess i just got a little carried away she said sheepishly i mean i was so close she said serenity smiled yes i know but hermione you cant get carried away like that said the elven princess hermione you have progressed more than any wizard or witch in this day and age could ever dream of progressing you should be proud but next time when i say it is time to stop you stop the two girls laughed and made their way back up to the castle both in need of a long rest xxx the next morning hermione awoke to an empty bed she frowned wondering if harry was getting back at her for leaving him early in the morning she sighed as she realized that she hadntseen harry at all yesterday except for the brief minutes before they both fell asleep she missed him yesterday and after she and serenity had retired inside after her training hermione had been looking forward to seeing harry at dinner unfortunately he didnt make it to dinner and hadnt returned from the training hall until well after midnight hermione had stayed up reading her book as she waited his return when he did finally return he had been so sore and tired he barely had energy to speak hermione felt bad for him and tried her best to aid him in any way she could which she knew harry appreciated greatly she didnt tell harry of her training as serenity instructed her not to serenity as well as hermione decided that it would only add more worry atop of his already stressed out mind hermione didnt want him to continuously worry for her safety he had enough to worry about hermione sighed as she stood up and walked over to the open balcony it was christmas eve today four days after the attack on gryffindor it was still early morning an hour or two after dawn and the air was chilly as it nipped at her bare neck a soft blanket of crisp snow now covered the lands having just fallen two nights prior she sighed as she winced at the dull pain that swam across her chest and arms she really had tired herself out yesterday what was she thinking as she turned from the balcony she went to take a quick shower before meeting serenity downstairs xxx harry sat within the dining hall his breakfast before him as he discussed more politics with lesser lords before him by now he was getting quite aggrivated as he was denied a single moment of peace sighing he turned his head up to look at one of the men addressing him lord oric i am in no mood to speak on this matter any longer he said smoothly ron looked up at him with a quirked eyebrow as he watched harry raise his hand indicating that this conversation was over and it was thier cue to leave the lords who had been in the middle of property gain discussions stood shocked as their prince ordered their leave finally a guard came from beside the door and escorted the few men out of the dining hall wow harry exclaimed ron you just totally dismissed half but he was interupted by harry as he suddenly stood up pushing his chair back as he did so loudly lily who had decided to eat breakfast in the hall this morning while her husband slept looked up at her son with concern he looked tired he had been up training with the aurors until well past midnight and the strains of worry and pressure pulled at his youthful face lily hated seeing her son like this and it hurt her to know of the burden that was laid upon him harry sighed as he bowed slightly in respect to his mother before silently turning to leave as he walked toward the entrance doors he saw as serenity entered li closely in tow li bowed respecively to the royals as well as serenity and harry could see the sadness that occupied her face she was worried and hurt to be kept in the dark of li secret harry didnt blame her as he too felt the same way good morning harry she said softly harry stopped and smiled morning serenity li he said as he addressed the two li nodded when exactly are you leaving li in about a quarter of an hour your highness harry nodded he was hoping li would stay and help finish the aurors training as he was skilled in that field but unfortunately he couldnt well then safe journey my friend he said and the two shook hands harry felt a warmth emit from the palm of the elf and suddenly felt a new surge of determination flow through him harry smiled once more i will be at the entrance court to bid you farewell with that harry turned once again to the doors of the hall as he was about to exit a brunette figure decided to round the corner and crash into him unknowingly ooff im sorry excuse me miss then harry paused and smiled warmly hermione he said softly hermione smiled and looked up at her husband harry good morning love she said sweetly his smile never left his face as he wrapped his arm around her ensuring she didnt leave him watch where you re going next time will ya he chidded playfully hermione giggled as she shoved at his chest he chuckled and then froze as she tipped up seizing his lips with hers harry smiled into her as he leaned down further to deepen the kiss and hermione wrapped her arms around his neck as her one hand ventured into his messy locks she held him to her as he kissed her passionately expressing his love for her and appologizing for not being with her last night ron stood from his seat and chuckled at his best mate he knew harry had been edgy all day yesterday after he awoke to find the bed empty and his mood didnt improve any as he struggled to train the aurors later that afternoon remus and sirius were to be aiding in training this morning which ron was grateful for he knew it eased his friend mind slightly to recieve aid from the higher aurors and heck ron was pleased as well seeing as he was struggling in the training too but he knew with hermione here harry day was starting off in the right foot and for that he was extra grateful everyone in the room seemed to watch the couple for a moment at their first public display of affection before turning thier attentions back to their previous tasks as to give the couple their privacy the staff of the castle already knew of the budding relationship between the two royals seeing as news spread rather quickly the culprit the young blushing servant boy who had accidentally walked in on the prince and his princess three days back nobody really seemed shocked at the display of emotion from the two royals well that is nobody with the exception of one queen lily of course she did know of the blossoming relationship between the two but she hadnt ever actually seen them express themselves before heck she didnt really even know if they were physically intimate with each other she had to admit she hadnt been this happy in a long time as she watched her son and his wonderful wife express their affections for each other harry smiled as he lavished hermione in his kiss he gave her his all as he kissed her he missed her and after spending just a day away from her killed him he had felt incomplete for some reason he only wished he knew what she had been doing to leave so early in the morning finally as his lungs begged him for air he broke from the brunette in his arms and moved to kiss her cheeks and forehead instead she giggled at his playfulness and nuzzled under his jaw as she hugged him i missed you she stated simply he smiled hugging her close i wish you didnt have to train the aurors today harry sighed he wished he didnt have to too im sorry hermione but this is my duty i have to protect you and protect this kingdom as well as your own she sighed as he told her this she knew it was for the best well since it is christmas eve do you think you could finish training early she asked as she batted her eyelashes playfully he laughed and sighed i ll try mione he chuckled hermione raised her eyebrow at the name but shrugged it off as he pulled her into the dining hall he walked her over to the table where the queen serenity and li were seated ron remained standing beside his chair as he twirled his wand in his hands harry pulled hermione chair out for her as she sat down and harry then turned to his own now cold plate immediately a servant from the kitchens came and replaced his plate and he smiled as his mother turned to them amused so she started as she didnt know what to say exactly she smiled widely as she examined her son and daughter in law she watched as harry dipped his left hand under the table a smile on his face and shook her head as hermione quickly dropped her fork gasping for a second then coughing lightly she shot harry a menacing look one which he ignored as he continued to eat his breakfast lily smiled at the two before a mischievios glint swam across her emerald eyes one that was totally credited to the infamous mauraders she turned to the two as she continued eating and casually asked so when can i tell your father to expect his grandchildren immediately harry began choking on his food for the second time in a week since his first technically second kiss to hermione four days ago in ravenclaw hermione blushed as red as a tomato as she patted her husbands back trying to ease his coughing fits finally as harry coughing subsided he turned to his red mother red himself as he stuttered wh what he choked out lily only gave him an innocent look as she looked to her son sweetly harry quickly glanced up at ron who was smiling before he began wiggling his eyebrows this only served to deepen the color on the prince red cheeks he glanced over at his wife who sported a similar blush and threw her a silent question she shook her head softly as if indicating no before turning to look down at her plate permanently oh didnt you hear me dear i asked when i could tell your father to i heard what you said mother he interupted he turned to hermione who was still staring down at her plate to say a blush was upon her face was an understatement as she turned redder than harry had ever seen one turn she refused to look up at him as well as the rest of the hall as they all were engulfed in a long silence for the hall it was an amused silence but for the couple every second seemed to drag like hours until finally your majesties sorry to interupt but we have readied the horse for the departure of sir li came the voice of the entrance guard everyone turned to look at the tall man standing in the hall doorway queen lily smiled and nodded thanking the guard before turning to li and serenity i am afraid the time has come to say our goodbyes she said serenity nodded sadly as she and li stood up from their seats at the dining table harry and hermione also stood up though refused to look at the others until they reached the entrance hall once the group had reached the castle large main doors they saw li off before a large burly guard came to announce that the assembled aurors were ready to begin their day training harry sighed and nodded before placing a soft kiss upon hermione cheek saying his goodbyes and yanking ron out after him serenity then turned to hermione well shall we be off then she asked hermione turned to her friend beside her and smiled you ready yep xxx hermione found herself back in the small clearing of the bordering forest it was chilly as serenity and hermione put up a warming barrier to keep the chill out the sunlight flooded the small patch of cleared land as the castle loomed behind the trees it truly was a calm and peaceful area the only other sounds being the twittering of the birds and the rustle of the leaves as they reached the center of the clearing serenity motioned for hermione to stand before her obeying hermione stood regaly before the elf serenity smiled and motioned for hermione to take a deep breath and then to sit again hermione obeyed now hermione remember relax your body serenity started hermione did so as she inhaled long slow breaths through her nose and exhaled slowly through her mouth good clear your mind and focus solely on the point in which you wish your power to gather to hermione nodded once more but frowned as this was the most difficult part of the training closing her eyes hermione brought her palms up before her and began to chanel her magical energy to form between her two palms she could feel her energy surge through her an exhilirating feeling that made her skin tingle as she relaxed her body and mind no thought entered her mind as she willed her magic to collect it wasnt until five minutes later that she sighed loudly before dropping her palms and opening her exhausted eyes serenity looked at her with half amusement and half question why d you stop because my energy wont collect replied hermione frustrated with her inability to perform serenity smiled softly as her friend continued i mean what am i doing wrong i am following your exact instructions i am relaxing breathing slowly clearing my thoughts and yet still no progress hermione came serenity voice amusement laced delicately between her comforting words you are doing absolutely nothing wrong but chaneling your magic takes a lot of discipline i will not happen in just a few hours of practicing she said with a smile she sat there for a second in thought before looking back up to her friend here stand up hermione raised her eyebrow before doing as she was told serenity stood from her spot and moved to stand directly before hermione only three feet seperating the toes of their slippered feet from the other serenity exhaled softly before raising her palms up before her with her fingers parallel to her chest and navel she formed her palms to look as if she held a circular object between them with one palm holding the top while the other supported the bottom she closed her eyes and once more began to chant incoherently instantly the green woodlands before hermione began to melt away as a darkness began to fall a darkness it was as if the two were encased in a black void the only light around them was the light that shown from beneath serenity and herself hermione gasped softly as serenity form slowly ascended a foot into the air as the shroud of black fully engulfed them serenity toes pointed below her and hermione gasped as she noticed how the elf toes touched the tip of crystaline water below the water began to ripple and hermione looked up to see serenity dress and hair begin to catch in the wind hermione too felt the cool air whip around her form as she stood on to watch suddenly serenity stopped chanting as the light breeze continued to whip around her she smiled as she slowly opened her eyes to hermione now i am going to show you how i call my energy to me perhaps this will aid you in your training and with that serenity closed her eyes once more hermione stood there as nothing happened until suddenly small golden lights began to shine all around them like little bulbs of light or small glowing fireflies the light grew softly before one by one began to get slowly closer hermione was surprised as she could actually feel exactly what it was serenity was doing to call the lights to her hermione felt a certain pull and watched as the lights slowly began to shoot toward the center of space between serenity palms slowly the small ball of magic between the elf palms began to grow and hermione could feel the heat radiating off of the mass of energy as well as the intensity of it it was truly amazing she understood now finally the bright light ceased in its growth as serenity chaneled the last of her energy she opened her eyes again and smiled at hermione who smiled back so do you think you are ready to try again hermione nodded serenity chuckeld softly and then the glow of light grew once more engulfing the two women in a soft warmth hermione then opened her eyes to find herself back in the sunny patch of the forest clearing serenity was before her smiling before dropping herself softly back to the ground before lookin up at the princess let try this again shall we hermione nodded and sat back down she took a few deep breaths as she listened to serenity coach her now dont push yourself she was saying you arent expected to get this right away training to control your magic can take a lifetime to learn and an eternity to master right now all we want is for you to be able to successfully concentrate your energy into one pinpoint hermione nodded sighing she did as she was told and began to concentrate her powers to one specific pinpoint between her two facing palms as she did this she began doing what it was that she felt serenity do to call her energy to her almost immediately hermione began to feel her power surging through her veins coursing through her she could once again feel her skin tingling and her blood moving she concentrated harder willing it to travel toward her palms and soon enough she began to feel a small warmth form between her two palms and it slowly began to grow serenity watched in amazement as she could feel hermione grasp her energy she could feel hermione will pushing her magic to the one place she was concentrating it on and was progressing beautifully in all truth serenity was surprised and hightly please as she watched as hermione energy began to form between her facing hands she might be ready to learn healing soon she is progressing quite quickly after achieving this just two days into the training perhaps it wont be as dangerous serenity thought to herself hermione continued to push her energy to her internally exhilarated at the feel of control over her magic but wouldnt show it for fear of loosing the hold she had she centered her entire being around manipulating and forming her magic to do as she willed it to and so far it was beginning to work it wasnt until hermione had gathered almost all of her coursing energy did she feel a straining pull on her body she knew serenity told her not to push herself but she was so close she could feel the sweat forming upon her brow and her muscles in her arms were beginning to tremble ok hermione i think that is enough remember dont push yourself danced serenity pleased voice hermione could hear the astonishement and excitement in the woman voice and that sent another course of determination and pride throughout her being she knew that if she pushed herself she might wear her body out for further training so she decided that enough was enough slowly in a way that seemed almost instinctive she felt herself magically grasping onto the small ball of energy between her palms as she ceased her mental push of energy once she was certain that her hold on her energy was firm she slowly began to open her chocolate eyes a large smile spreading its way across her fine features serenity was smiling as well and nodded in an approved manner as hermione glanced down at the ball of energy that floated between her hands suspended by her mental hold of magic and hovering almost weightlessly for her she could feel the heat and strength in the magic just as she felt serenity s it was an amazing feeling of pride that swelled within her and her stomach did soft flips at her excitement but along with the excitement came exhaustion suddenly now that her body was fully relaxed did she feel the strain her body had been put under her eyes felt heavy and her upper arms felt like jelly slowly hermione relinquished her mental hold on the energy and slowly she allowed her body to call back what was once apart of it the ball of energy gradually began emitting the energy it was made of and began its course back through the princess veins hermione loved the feel of how the magic was filling her again it coursed through her entire being and gave her an extra burst of energy as she allowed it to engulf her body in warmth finally when the last bit of energy had found its way back into her hermione released a breath she didnt know she was holding as she allowed her hands to fall into her lap her shoulders sagged as she smiled a tired yet exhilirated smile she looked to serenity who sported a similar smile sans the tirednesss and excitement coursed through her i did it she whispered softly serenity giggled and nodded happily you did wow that was amazing hermione came the elf reply she smile at her friend before turning her attention to a small velvety pouch that hung at her side she extracted a polygon shaped box from the pouch and tossed it to hermione hermione caught it and smiled a chocolate frog she asked in amusement serenity nodded and motioned her to eat the sweet yep remus used to alway keep a bag of them with him as he would train us as kids harry and i never understood why remus always had such a unyeilding belief that chocolate frogs and any other sort of chocolate was such an energy booster but we never complained ron used to over work himself on purpose just as an excuse to get his treat serenity stopped and laughed at the memories before continuing well that was until fred and george switched the bag of frogs with some new concoction they had just made cant remember the exact name but ron had retired to the lavatory the rest of the day and well into the night serenity giggled once more and hermione joined in with her poor ron never trusted remus bag of frogs again he does seem to be the butt of all of the twins pranks poor guy replied hermione as she finished up her chocolate serenity giggled though it never reached her eyes hermione could tell that her eyes were still clouded with concern for her beloved serenity had been puttin on a mask all morning as she had done yesterday feigning that the wounds upon li arms werent constantly occupying her mind but hermione saw right through it she knew for she was suffering the same plague of worries thoughts of a wounded harry never left her mind and no matter how much she tried to convince herself that harry would be alright that nagging gnawing feeling in the pit of her stomach never seemed to cease its torture upon her well hermione swam serenity voice interupting hermione of her thoughts you ready to begin your training begin asked hermione serenity smiled and nodded a glint in her eye that made hermione swell with excitement and a little bit of apprehension yep ready to begin healing xxx the weeks flew by and serenity was thoroughly shocked at the progress hermione had been making they had just entered the second week of january and by now hermione had improved so well that she was finally practicing simple acts of healing not as advanced as healing an actual being serenity had hermione training on simpler organisms just as the training elves were subjected to plants serenity would take hermione out into the snow covered forest and would find blades of grass baby shrubs even damaged tree trunks and would then instruct hermione on how to concentrate her magic to repair the severed torn or damaged cells hermione doubted herself at first but that quickly melted away when she had first performed an act of healing by healing a crushed branch of a sapling healing serenity found came easy to hermione though hermione was oblivious to this herself serenity watched with wonder and amazement as hermione could easily wield her power she truly was a gifted witch but unfortunately harry was beginning to become suspicious always departing to train harry wondered constantly where it was that hermione was heading to and why she was returning tired and exhausted he didnt like it and hermione and serenity were beginning to notice his constant questioning serenity what do i tell him hermione asked as she and serenity walked throughout the caslte gardens she and serenity had not ventured out into the forest in the last week for harry constant suspicion and the growing power of the dark arts were enough to keep them within the walls that didnt bother the two women any seeing as the castle gardens worked just as well it ok hermione dont worry we ll take care of this she told her perhaps it would be best to hold out on training for a while you have already improved beyond my expectations immensely we ll take the week off and you spend the week with harry that ll calm him down and surpress his suspicions hermione nodded and sighed she didnt like keeping the training from him but knew it wasnt the right time to tell him yet he d get too worried for her the two continued their walk throughout the snow covered gardens as they discussed the probability of an approaching war and of their worries for the kingdoms both elven and wizarding serenity was extremely concerned now after li return to the elven lands his promise came true and her mother along with a faction of guardian elves arrived later that evening letters and differnt forms of discrete messaging was being sent between the two but li refused to indulge her with any information concerning himself or why he hurried to return without her her mother was also curious as to what his intentions were and wondered why it was prefered that she depart from her kindgom sirius had stayed back with serenity and was glad to have his wife back with him but he too seemed to be retaining information serenity and her mother were getting restless and hermione could see it in her friends eyes all of the stress worry and fear was beginning to build and she feared her friend might not be able to supress it any longer but hermione found that she couldnt concentrate on her friend worries for too long for she herself was being weighed down by her own worry and fear for harry harry had been working dilagently on training his band of aurors and constantly returned to their chambers in the wee hours of the morning tired and in pain if he wasnt out in the training hall he was locked behind the doors of the conference hall with delegates and other royals straining to prepare logical attack routes and preparing ways in which to keep the kingdoms safe king james was still quite wounded but now found the energy to attend the meetings and aid his son hermione knew that this also added to the worry atop her husband head his father strength was diminishing and his attendance to meetings and trainings were short she feared that perhaps king james legacy as the great king of gryffindor was slowly coming to an end and she knew harry suffered from these thoughts as well it pained her to see harry so depleated of energy and confidence for she saw it even if he hid it so well from the others she saw it and it physically pained her it was then she decided that she was going to do what ever she could to relieve him of his worries it was her duty as a wife and lover and she would adhear to it she felt guilty that her training had pulled her away from him in his time of need and she was going to do all she could to help xxx later on that night hermione and serenity had retired to the warmth of the castle for some tea and hot cocoa beside the fire while awaiting the for the meeting in which harry was in to end hermione sat there curled into her plush armchair beside the fire thumbing her mug of steaming chocolate her eyes unfocused as she stared into the fire lost in thought she wanted to relieve harry of all his stress but didnt know exactly how she was also worried for the meeting that he was in right now was called in emergency sir lancey declaring that new valuable information about the whereabouts of the death eater location being revealed hermione had wanted to attend but harry advised against it why she had no idea but respected her husband decision and now found herself staring into the dancing ember flames as worry clouded her thoughts serenity noticed this but kept to herself she knew the princess had a lot on her mind and decided that it was best to leave her to her own thoughts for a while she held her cup of jasmine tea in her delicate hands as she struggled to find a way in which her elven people could and would aid the wizarding kind she so desperately wanted to help her father race but she knew of her people thoughts on the wizarding kind she didnt understand them very well but knew they were against the mingling of races as both princesses stewed in their own thoughts a loud burst through the door snapped them out of their stupors immediately ginny argh that why that argh i hate men shouted the red head hermione and serenity stared at her for a moment in shock before replacing their looks of surprise for looks of amusement serenity smiled and quirked an eyebrow up at the flaming redhead as hermione braved to ask her who and what she was talkin about ginny what happened she asked though she failed miserably at masking the amusement in her voice ginny seemed to ignore her as she fumed to herself she stomped up into the cozy common room and threw herself onto the couch she grabbed a cup of tea and tossed a few cubes of sugar into it before crossing her legs her foot shakin up and down in irritation hermione and serenity threw each other looks of interest as they both watched the girl ginny cheeks were beat red adding to her look of fury and she squinted her eyes with lips pursed she truly looked like a younger hermione mused ginny came serenity cautious voice ginny threw the two girls a look before sighing angrily please guys i dont wanna talk about it came her curt reply just know that seamus finnigan is a real prat she said before slamming down her full cup of tea i need some air and with that the fuming girl stood and exited the common room leaving behind two bewildered yet amused young ladies as ginny stomped her way out of the common room she pushed past harry who greeted her in the nicest matter her huff of annoyance and flustered cheeks sent his eyebrow on a skyward mission a small smirk upon his lips he watched as she stomped her way down the corridor before turning to the two women within the room his silent question and amused manner earned him a couple of shrugs that was until serenity decided to break the silence seamus finnigan was all she said harry looked to her and smiled ahh i see he said before chuckling softly hermione felt her heart soar at the lighthearted look on his face for a moment and secretly thanked both ginny and seamus for the change in atmosphere she then watched as harry turned his attention onto her and sigh immediately hermione felt her heart drop into the pit of her stomach hermione care to take a walk with me hermione nodded not showing her concern for a moment as she stood from her spot before the fire serenity shot her a look of concern for harry and hermione sighed she made her way over to harry and giggled as he wrapped his arm protectively around her as she leaned against him and escorting her out of the room and down the corridor heading for the gardens harry seemed lost in thought as they walked down the many corridors but hermione found that she didnt quite mind she was simply enjoying being next to him as she wrapped her arm around his lower back her other resting upon his chest as the two reached the gardens hermione prepared to take a left as she always did but this time harry pulled her right her look of surprise brought a smile to the prince face as he lead her on through the unfamiliar gardenside through twists and turns through snow covered hedges under wooden beams ladden in hibernating rose vines and past a large rounded fountain hermione reveled in the view this unfamiliar half of the gardens had to offer regardless of the lack of life and luster due to winter chill hermione still found it to be quite beautiful the ground in which she stepped on was made of mosaic flagstone designs and roman colomns and tall cypres trees gave the gardens a more romantic feel finally harry stopped pulling hermione beside him before turning to his right and extending his hand hermione looked over to see the back of the tower in which their sleeping chambers were she quiked an eyebrow as she wondered what harry was about to do accio firebolt he called and hermione eyes widened as his firebold came whizzing of of their balcony and finally into harry outstretched hand he then smiled down at her before placing the softest of kisses upon her brow come with me he whispered hermione felt him tug at her hand and pull her up a small flight of stone stairs that led onto a platform another circular fountain placed gracefully within the center of the stone platform hermione watched as harry mounted his broom i sure do hope he doesnt expect me to get on that thing her mind screamed obviously harry didnt hear her mental words as he turned to her expectantly extending his hand to her come with me hermione he said softly hermione hesitated as she stared at the slender wood that she was expected to sit upon harry noticed her apprehention and chuckeld softly he unmounted his broom as he gently laid it upon the ground he then made his way over to his wife smiling softly as he wrapped his arms around her waist it is ok hermione i would never do anything that would put you in harms way he said softly hermione believed him but still felt weary about mounting that broom harry then pressed his forehead to hers before continuing come on i swear it ll be worth it finally hermione gave in to her husband and allowed him to guide her over to the firebolt and listened as he coached her on how to sit properly hermione had no idea how complicated sitting atop a broom could be she wrapped her arms tightly around his waist as he positioned himself before her he smiled at her nervous form and found it adorable how she would blush profusely from both anxiety and embarassment then he gently squeazed her hand upon his stomach before counting aloud letting her prepare for their lift off no matter what harry did nothing would have prepared her for what came next a whoosh of cool air a pressure from above then weightlessness hermione eep echoed throughout the chilly night air as harry rose and her arms instictively squeazed at her husbands wiast as she buried her head into his back she refused to open her eyes as she felt the night air whip past her as harry ascended to the heavens up up up they went and the higher they went the lighter she began to feel harry softly chuckled at his wife as she held on for dear life he wanted her to relax for the view was amazing and he didnt want her to miss this slowly harry allowed the broom to slow and he began to gently rub the back of hermione clentched palm he chuckled once more as she whimpered grabbing her hand he gently untangled her fingers from his tunic before pressing it to his lips it ok hermione he whispered softly its ok open your eyes love trust me you want to see this harry smiled as he slowly felt her grip loosen though not entirely he felt as she slowly pulled her face from his back pressing her chest against his back harry smile widened as he turned to look at her from over his shoulder as her eyes fluttered open suddenly a gasp filled the night air as hermione found herself staring up at the full orange moon and twinkling stars it was simply breath taking you like it hermione had lost her voice for a moment it it beautiful she whispered harry smiled and rubbed the back of her palms once more as he tilted his head back to lean it against hers hermione was shocked for a moment before smiling and leaning further into him after a few moments harry pulled forward a little and smiled back at her hold on tight now he told her before he tilted the broom forward zipping lower to the ground hermione screamed as she once again buried her face into his back minutes past and hermione was beginning to wonder just where it was they were going obviously they werent landing much to hermione disappointment but were moving forward it wasnt for another few moments did she feel the change in directions immediately she felt her stomach plummet into her gut as harry took a southward dip hermione didnt know whether to scream or what as they descended finally she felt the firm solid ground beneath her feet as harry chuckled she slowly opened her eyes and sighed as she saw the ground beneath her she quickly hopped off of the broom followed by harry after untangling her hands from his waist hermione then immediately slapped harry back harry james potter you do that again and i ll you ll what he interupted hermione stopped staring at harry with shock as he moved to stand directly before her hermione felt her stomach flip with anticipation as she took in his form before her i i ll but she didnt get a chance to finish for harry swallowed her words in a passionate kiss hermione moaned as he pressed his body to hers and harry in turn moaned as he felt her press her chest against his harry pulled her close to him as close as he possibly could as he poured his feelings into the woman he adored he didnt know any other way of expressing his love for her and felt that no other way but physical display could communicate just how much she meant to him hermione sighed as she fisted a handful of harry ebony hair and cupped the back of his neck pressing him firmly against herself she loved the feel of his lips as he worked them against her own and reveled in the emotion he was conveying to her she truly knew of no other way she would want to spend her time with him well their was pretty much no other way but unfortunately for the couple air was a necessity and their lungs screamed for it harry sighed as he pulled away from her resting his forehead against her won as he ran his thumbs against her sides i love you he whispered hermione smiled and pressed closer to him as she ran her fingers down his chest he smiled back content to just be with her and i love you she whispered just as softly he smiled before leaning forward to kiss her lips softly in an innocent kiss when he broke from the brief kiss he took her hands in his and pulled her forward hermione quirked an eyebrow before gasping as harry spun her and pressed her back against his chest before her was the open sea the moon floating gracefully above it as a soft moonlit path was splayed against the water lapping against the shore beneath them hermione found that they were standing at the tip of a precipice the trees of the forest looming behind them protectively as they enjoyed night harry wrapped his arms tightly around her form as he rested his chin atop her shoulder hermione he called softly hermione smiled and tilted her head against his before replying hmmm harry hesitated for a moment which caught hermione curious attention as she turned sligthly to get a better look at him harry he sighed once more before standing up fully as he stared across the ocean before him hermione as you have probably guessed new information has surfaced concerning the whereabouts of the death eaters he started hermione listened intently along with this information comes distubing news as well it appears that the death eaters have devised a way to fully regenerate voldemort former body and if this happens there is no telling what might happen he said solemnly hermione couldnt she was prepared to hear that tonight for that would be a lie but for some reason it didnt bother her as much as she figured it would have but how can that be she found herself saying harry sighed wishing he knew the answeres himself but unfortunately that information was not provided i dont know hermione hermione stared at him for a moment studying his face his eyes she knew there was more she could see it in his eyes that isnt all that you wanted to tell me is it harry she asked harry looked down at her a mixed look of amusement and sadness clouding his eyes no that isnt all that i wanted to tell you hermione he told her i just dont know how to word the rest of it just say it harry tell me harry sighed audibly clearly stressed at what he was about to say next well you see if voldemort is able to regain even a fraction of his former power the existance of the four kingdoms will be over he started we must prevent this from happening at all cost and how do you suppose you are going to do that by departing tomorrow to destroy the death eaters at this hermione gasped what she cried harry had expected this and was fully prepared for any shrill screaming but the one thing he didnt prepare himself for was the look in which would occupy her eyes total and utter sadness and worry but but you cant you arent ready if you go now it could mean it could mean that we could destroy voldemort strongest asset he interjected hermione stared at him and suddenly as much as she wanted to argue this out she suddenly found herself tired she no longer had the energy to argue no matter harry ll hear it all later but perhaps now it was best that she just stayed with him for he obviously was struggling internally with this she then remembered her resolution to help ease the worry from her husband no matter how short lived it may be and she decided now was better time than any to start with that hermione turned in his arms and slid her arms arond his neck harry raised his eyebrows at his wife before she tilted forward pressing agaisnt him as she took his lips with hers she bit and suckled his lower lip as she ran her hand down his chest once more harry groaned as she slid her warm hand beneath his tunic grazing his taut muscles with her fingernails finally she pulled away but only to begin a trail of kisses along his jaw to his ear down his neck and finally across collarbone all the while muttering sweet words of support for her husband harry could find no words to express what he felt at that moment his senses were so ladden with emotion that he barely was able to pay attention to his wife words of support and love she truly was an angel a blessing to him from heaven to ease his soul and to guide his strength he loved her and he needed her more than anything with that final thougth harry bent forward and recaptured hermione mouth with his he removed his cloak from his shoulders not once breaking the kiss from his wife and successfully managed to lay it across the soft grass behind them harry then pulled hermione to him before slowly beginning to lower her onto his cloak behind hermione giggled into the kiss as harry lavished and loved her it was going to be a nigth to

blessed to look upon you once more spoke the dark haired green eyed prince he spoke gently his voice deep and silky his eyes soft and sincere he brushed a stray strand of her long sleek black hair away from her face as he stared intently into dark captivating eyes a soft blush swept across her pale features making his heart flutter and a smile to appear on his lips sleep well my prince she replied he gently took her hand in his as he bent to kiss it goodnight giggling softly she ever so tenderly bade him goodnight as she gently kissed his lips it was a quick kiss nothing elaborate but a

george ron and seamus made funny faces finally fred trotted over and as casually as ever bent over and blew a large whistle into harry ear slightly startled harry looked around and muttered a little huh as his eyes focused and his dazed expression disappeared bloody hell harry ron chuckled what gotten into you what do you mean he asked nothing had gotten into me oh come off it harry exclaimed seamus you were drooling all over yourself everybody laughed harry blushed red so who is she asked fred casually while leaning against the large hearth wha ahh dontact dumb harry you re acting like a lovesick puppy retorted ron i am not love harry started indignantly what her name harry george demanded a little more forcefully harry just sighed her name is lady cho chang of ravenclaw exclaimed the four boys astonished she was known to be the most beautiful courtier in all of ravenclaw she was also one heck of a good quidditch seeker according to ron so she got to you too eh laughed fred when

his already messy hair sweet aintit our little harry bear growin up bugger off you guys cried harry and throwing a pillow at the twins aww but your highness news such as this should be celebrated exclaimed seamus he drew his wand and began summoning little heart shaped figures to float down upon the prince and then burst into millions of pieces of confetti seamus is right harry said fred as he and george threw pillows back at harry at the same time soon the conversation developed into a full fledged pillow war feathers flew as pillows were launched at the boys heads suddenly as harry tossed a rather large feather pillow at an unsuspecting ron the sound of trumpets filtered into his ears amidst all the laughter whoa guys stop harry yelled over the noise without warning four pillows slammed rather roughly into his face a roar of laughter filled the room as the four pillows fell from his face spitting out the feathers from his mouth he gave them all a dirty look before turning his attention out the window by now the others had heard the trumpets as well and had all congregated around the tall coved window to see what all the commotion was for harry look yelled ron it your parents carriage they re back ron was right his parents had arrived but they re early they werentdue back from ravenclaw kingdom for another day or so harry said well best go and welcome them eh he made his way to the doors as the others followed all the while pulling feathers out of his tunic and hair the grand entrance hall was crammed with advisors and servants ready to greet the king and queen harry moved swiftly down the marble staircase happy and carefree he made his way up to the doors and stood at the top of the steps outside watching as the carriage pulled inform of the cascading castle stairs as the carriage stopped a young doorman quickly made his way over to the carriage door after opening the door he let down three golden steps from underneath the carriage and watched as the king emerged harry smiled his father always had a striking presence and any who stood within the same room as he felt the optimistic glow that radiated from his smile harry had always been told he was the spitting image of his father from his ever messy ebony locks to his light speedy yet muscular build of his body but the one characteristic harry had not received from his father but rather from his mother were his eyes the same striking emerald green that were the windows to his soul the king smiled broadly as he looked up into the face of his son at the top of the stairs before turning to the carriage he stood on the side of the small golden steps and held out his closed fist then a small petite hand emerged from behind the curtained carriage and placed it atop the king s harry watched as his mother the queen stepped gracefully out of the carriage her long garnet auburn hair pulled beautifully into an array of braids and pulls supporting a stunning yet slightly modest crown her face was soft and fair and her smile was bright and genuine as the king and queen ascended the large staircase harry went to meet them halfway on the landing ahh just the boy i was hoping to see exclaimed king james as he placed a fatherly hand upon harry shoulder a sign of greeting harry did the same father he said quietly i pray your trip went well but you seem to have arrived much earlier than planned why oh yes our trip went splendid dear said the queen interrupting the king before he had a chance to answer harry smiled before leaning over and placing a soft kiss on his mother cheek i glad to hear it he told his mother as they climbed the stairs into the palace yes son and i have come with proposition for you as well a proposition concerning what asked harry well concerning king james began james queen lily interrupted for the second time that night it is late and you are quite fatigued perhaps this should wait until sunlight she said warningly james looked at her questionably before sighing deeply yes i suppose you are right he replied harry looked between the two before shrugging it off the next morning was proving to be a beautiful one as harry woke from a dream of his foreign beauty he felt his spirits soar at the site of the morning light he made his way down to the great dining hall for breakfast to see his parents already seated in their usual seats at the head of the table they were speaking firmly but quietly apparently deep in conversation over an important topic good morning harry said as he kissed his mother cheek before taking his seat king james smiled yes it is harry said the king while looking at his wife she gave him an odd look before turning to her breakfast he just sighed deeply listen harry there are important issues i need to inform you of while speaking to the ravenclaw king we had decided it would be in our best interests for both kingdoms if one second dear said queen lily as she put a soft hand on her husbands harry what is this i hear of you and a certain courtier she asked with a soft smile forming over her red lips james looked back to his son surprised harry just cleared his throat and blushed again he seems to be doing a lot of that lol oh yea umm he trailed off for a bit fidgeting well who is she son questioned the king he had a look about him that harry couldntquite read her her name is lady cho chang of ravenclaw sir started harry suddenly he got a wisp of the well known gryffindor courage and went on she is really beautiful mother at this the queen smiled really smart she is and funny i ve only spent a day with her yet but i really like her and we seem to have a lot in common queen lily looked over at her husband sadly king james seemed to fidget a little as well harry looked between the two suspicious they are up to something ok what is it what is going on well dear you see started the queen son i dontthink i want you seeing lady cho again harry spluttered at this what why no harry yelled defiantly why couldnthe see her what was wrong with her nothing they had no right telling him whom he could see or not he was 17 years old and could take care of himself harry please you just need to calm down and listen said the queen rationally harry didntwant to listen he shot a look at his father hoping he would explain such reasons as to why he couldntsee cho harry when visiting with king richard the two of us came up with a contract proposal said the king a contract what asked harry unbelievably he couldntbelieve his ears a contract proposal wherein you and the ravenclaw princess hermione are to wed with the recent economic fall of ravenclaw due to the last dark war we both figured that the best remedy would be to merge wait harry started shocked you mean an arranged marriage he yelled outraged he suddenly burst out of his seat no i wonthear of it harry please just calm down said his mother no mother your king here plans on arranging me in a false marriage and i wont have it i refuse and with that harry burst out of the hall fuming king james too got to his feet how dare he speak to me in that matter i am his father and his king he bellowed lily just sighed sit down james before you hurt yourself i will not be spoken to like that he yelled he will show me the proper respect i deserve and with that he stormed out of the hall and followed his son quickly the queen too strode off after her husband the two went down corridors up staircases through twists and turns before finally reaching the corridor leading up to the tower in which harry room was situated james james will you please stop this nonsense lily begged i signed the contract with ravenclaw and by merlin that boy will listen or bad things will happen he yelled but he does not love her this isntabout love lily then perhaps it should be she sighed and grabbed his shoulder turning him to her a sapling cannot grow in the shadow of a mighty oak james the boy needs sunlight she said softly james looked at her for a moment before roughly continuing his way up to harry room what the boy needs is a good whipping he muttered under his breath he burst through harry doors and looked about the room when the queen entered she sighed and sat on his vacant bed his broom cupboard had been left wide open and bare the large coved window in the room had too been left open as the curtains billowed softly in the early morning breeze not again said the queen guards find him i want him back here now ok sorry it is a cliffy lol couldnthelp myself well please r r and tell me what you think one more thing i

19 two years fresh out of hogwarts li is 25 harry is older than hermione by a month and a half july 31 and september 19 his birthday is now before hers i know that in the books hermione is older but i changing it everyone else is the same age as they would normally be harry and hermione were married on september 28 also hermione in this story is not a muggleborn witch i know that is a big part of the hermione we all know but she had to be the princess of ravenclaw somehow so she has become the daughter of a pureblood and a muggle a half blood oh and also seamus is also born to a wizard and a witch his mother being muggleborn harry though is considered a pureblood because he is the son of a pureblood and a muggle born witch since both his parents are actually magical his mother heritage is not considered now on with the story xxxxxxxxxx chapter twenty a war begins xxx let go son it time harry nodded thought softly as he took one last look at his wife and his family before pulling the reigns of his horse guiding it alongside the departing aurors he threw glances back at his wife and family as often as he could before he was finally out of sight hermione stood there quiet and breaking she feared for his safety so much that it physically pained her tears broke the surface and now truly fell now that the reality of him leaving to war was starting to settle in he was gone thunder clashed ahead indicating that the rain was soon to fall hermione stood there staring sullenly at the spot where harry once stood before he left then it started to rain it was then that hermione realized that she was tired with all of the training worry and pain her body suddenly felt drained and tired silent sobs wracked her body and all of a sudden her knees gave out dropping her to the now wet grave below her she could vaguely hear the queens serenity ginny and mrs weasley call out to her as they saw her fall but was glad when they decided to let her be then she cried she brought her palms to her face as she released all the stress that had built up within her strong violent tremors shook her body as she prayed for her husband safety through her tears please merlin bring him back to me xxx rain pounded the graveled path below as hermione sobbed her shoulders shook violently as she poured her heart into her hands she couldntcontain herself as she willed herself to but it appeared her heart was fighting to release all the stress it had been gradually filling with since she first learned of her husbands duty her thick hair hung heavily around her face as it filled with their drink and her elaborate robes pulled her body down against the gravel the raindrops fell thick from their clouds and pelted the ground below the rain mimicked her tears that fell from her eyes falling with a fury and speed crashing bitterly against the grounds below after a few painful minutes queen lily felt that hermione had suffered her body enough after summoning a thick cloak to her she quickly braved the harsh weather as she made her way over to her daughter in law at first lily expected to feel the cold heavy drops of rain descend upon her but was quickly surprised to find that she was still as dry as she had been inside turning she smiled as she saw serenity standing at the doors of the castle her arm outstretched as she cast a protective field atop the queen lily then turned her attention to the crying princess hermione she said softly as she knelt draping the dry cloak around the sobbing princess shoulders hermione sniffled as she raised her gaze to her mother in law queen lily gasped oh hermione hermione choked back a sob as she hastily wiped away at the burning tears i i ok she replied her voice watery and hoarse she sniffled and hiccuped repeatedly as lily hugged her soaking shoulders helping the girl to stand come dear let us get you inside and dry hermione nodded despondently as she allowed the queen to lead her back into the castle serenity still remained at the threshold of the castle with ginny leaning sadly against her shoulder as lily brought hermione into the castle serenity came the queen soft voice serenity looked up at the queen in question could you please see to it that a pot of hot tea is brought up to the princess hermione chambers that would be greatly appreciated serenity nodded quickly as she smiled sadly of course aunt lily i shall bring it up personally lily smiled softly as she pulled hermione up the grand staircase to her chambers xxx it had been a few hours since the departure of the aurors and harry and the dark evening sky was thick with storm clouds still as the night progressed hermione remained within her room with serenity and ginny as her company as she clutched harry pillow to her aching breast she hadntleft her bed since she first sat upon it after changing her clothes earlier that afternoon laying upon harry side of the bed hermione refused to leave as the others understood her reasoning she clutched his pillow tightly as she stared at her tea cup now cold from its hours of still standing thoughts of harry ran through her mind as she remembered their first meeting on their wedding day oh how things have changed since that day she thought as a small smile tugged unconsciously at her lips she remembered how angered she had been after harry had kissed her and then turned to cho she also remembered how great a dancer he was before he professed his love for cho once more to her she then laughed out loud as the memory of their first morning swam through her mind serenity and ginny looked up in surprise at hearing the princess laugh serenity raised an eyebrow as ginny smiled softly what is it ginny asked hermione jumped slightly as if she had forgotten there were others in the room she looked up and smiled softly at ginny oh it it nothing she said softly a small trace of a smile still upon her lips come on hermione whined ginny playfully as she enjoyed the lighter feel of the mood that now filled the room serenity was also smiling as she felt more at ease at hermione change in mood what is it hermione turned her attention back to the porcelain dish before her as her eyes casted a far away look upon the cup her small smile never left her as she let out a small sigh i was just remembering she said softly ginny raised her eyebrows in question as serenity stood from her seat and made her way to the bed she sat upon hermione side of the bed as hermione pressed the pillow tighter against her chest remembering about the first morning harry and i shared together serenity and ginny smiled as they watched their friend before them after a few moments of silence hermione went on to explain just what had happened that morning ginny laughed prettily as hermione finished and serenity had an adorable smirk on her face laughing softly hermione smiled at them silently thanking them for helping her through her pain their presence really did help calm her and having her friends close to talk to helped make the situation a bit easier to accept she wasntthe only one who watched a loved one ride off this morning she kept reminding herself xxx when hermione awoke the next morning a new sense of sadness filled her as she saw harry side of the bed unoccupied she had dreamt that he had returned to her and was lying next to her now holding her but alas it was but a dream she was witnessing the cruel sense of reality slapped her in the face as she reached a hand out to run it down the length of sheets that was harry s her hand lingered there for a while before she pulled herself across the bed to lay her body there immediately tears welled in her eyes as she could smell the soft traces of her husband upon the pillow and sheets his masculine scent of musk and other smells filled her red nose as she dug said nose deep into his pillow silently praying that it would muffle her soft sobs from her own ears after several minutes of lying there hermione decided that it was foolish to wallow in her despair as there were more important things that she should be devoting her time to with that decided hermione pulled her body slowly out of her warm bed and proceeded to ready herself for the day it was going to be a long and hard day she predicted and she was not looking forward to it at all xxx the dining hall that morning had an air of depression and loneliness to it the tapestry covered stone walls looked bleak and cold and the large windows offered nothing but a grey cloud filled sky as view it seemed the whole kingdom of gryffindor was suffering in the departure of their prince as hermione entered she was pleased to see king james seated at the head of the table once more like harry his wound was taking a while to heal properly but for the king age was another factor that flew against him unlike his young son of 19 years king james was now reaching into his mid forties at 44 his body was showing signs of slower recovery and quicker fatigue but after a good three weeks of healing hermione was pleased to see her father in law in such good conditions good morning hermione came his kind voice hermione smiled at him noting the loss of his usual uplifting optimism as she reached the long table queen lily she noticed was eyeing her carefully as the princess lowered herself into her chair hermione knew they were all very worried for her and it made her feel slightly uplifted but then again it can get quite irritating at the same time as the family of potters ate their food in silence hermione was secretly thankful when a loud peeved serenity entered the hall a while later her current guardian following closely behind her i understand that it is your duty to protect and watch over me but that doesntmean you have to do it mere inches behind me rang her irritated voice as she directed her anger to the man behind her she continued her way into the hall as her slippered feet pounded the marble flooring slightly harder than normal indicating her annoyance further i understand that also your highness but in times like these i do not wish to take any chances in allowing any harm to come to you he told her serenity huffed as she rounded the long table making her way up to her usual seat i am simply following my ord your orders yes i know she interjected the guardian nodded as she sighed yes well just for today i am releasing you of your duties she told him he looked to her confused as he tried to understand her summoning your highness im afraid i do not understa that means that you are not to be following me around today she interrupted once more i am ordering you to find something else to occupy your time with for i have some unfinished business to attend to privately her pointed glare stopped any forming objections in her guardian mind as he decided that the only thing he could do was obey his princess though thoroughly annoyed the guardian nodded and bowed before exiting the hall shortly after serenity sighed and shook her head li i need you back here she thought as she took her seat up in the hall ignoring the pointed stares she was currently receiving from the other occupants of the room later on after everyone had eaten and was content serenity stood from her seat asking hermione for a word in private hermione quickly agreed and exited the hall immediately behind serenity yes serenity what is it asked hermione slightly worried serenity smiled is something the matter no serenity chuckled softly i was just wondering if you were up to continuing your healing training today she said i think it will help take your mind off of harry departure and it will be good to keep practicing hermione smiled nodding her head in yes yes that would be great serenity thank you xxx as the weeks passed little words of comfort came back to the castle of gryffindor concerning the progress of the aurors hermione was beginning to seriously worry about harry but knew that it was impossible for him to keep in regular touch it appeared the war was farther advanced than she had anticipated from what news was sent back from either harry or sirius the potters and the families of the castle had a pretty good idea of the intensity of this war but to all of their confusion slytherin had not since attacked a single point since the attack on gryffindor that december but it wasntuntil a dreary night in mid march did they hear of attacks but the target of the attack was the most shocking of all hogwarts xxx sirius where sirius harry called out as he ran the length of the auror camp weaving in and out of housing tents and training targets the training aurors shrugged and shook their heads none of them having seen the auror leader harry sighed in annoyance as he continued to search out his godfather when he finally reached his large tent he pushed through with heavy force and a grunt of frustration startling the unsuspecting ron hey what wrong with you called ron as he fastened the last of the leather straps of his protective arm gear for training harry ran a hand through his hair as he dropped himself onto the small cot like bet ron leaned up against harry writing desk as he studied the look upon harry face what is bothering you mate what happened harry sighed and turned his attention to ron he stood up and pulled the flap of the tent back so that he could get a good look at the auror camp have you seen sirius he asked his best friend ron shook his head no last time i saw him was earlier this morning after he received that letter why harry shook his head where are you i ve just learned some disturbing news he told ron as he turned to face him ron face changed from a look of curiosity to fearful what do you mean disturbing news harry took a breath to steady himself as he prepared to tell his friend of what he had just learned when suddenly a cloaked figure came bursting into the tent harry whirled around and ron froze as they heard the figure come in immediately the tall man before the two pulled his cloak off of his hooded body in haste harry let out a breath of relief as he recognized him to be the very man he was looking for sirius he said where have you been we need to talk now he told him as sirius rushed over to the writing desk spreading the tightly wrapped scroll he held in his hand atop the desk it appears that not now harry sirius interrupted him harry looked to him in shock what do you mean not now this is urgent sirius didntgive harry a second glance as he pulled a small thin golden case from his robes i am afraid we have a much serious problem on our hands harry face contorted in confusion what he asked he took a few steps forward and grasped his godfather shoulders jerking him slightly so that he turned his attention to him what are you talking about you donteven know what it was i was about to tell you harry hogwarts has been ambushed sirius exclaimed harry froze wh what he stuttered how that impossible isntit ambushed sirius sighed as he turned now to harry no harry it isntimpossible he said do you remember when slytherin attacked hogwarts a few months back harry nodded well that was done to obtain information so that they could have access into the castle at another time of their choice harry looked confused and ron looked slightly green but he paused he was speechless now it seems that hogwarts has just been under serious attack was anybody hurt at this sirius turned his attention back onto the desk before him he grasped the ledge of the desk leaning his weight upon his hands he hung his head low as he sighed a ragged breath then solemnly he nodded yes i am afraid their have been some serious injuries as well harry stood stock still of course he knew the answer but actually hearing it voiced affected him sirius who was hurt sirius gripped the ledge tighter then his knuckles turning a deathly white many they arentsure if their were any deaths but many students and teachers alike have been badly injured harry nodded slowly still taking in the information but he could sense that their was something sirius wasnttelling him he knew it must be bad for sirius to make a face as he was and he immediately feared the worst hermione sirius who else was hurt was it hermione serenity he asked in panic but it cant have been hermione or serenity they are both back at gryffindor castle he thought then sirius caught his attention he shook his head as he let out another ragged sigh no they have not been hurt then who bill xxx back at gryffindor castle mayhem ensued aurors dashed the halls as they struggled to keep everything under order and safety the entire house of gryffindor had been portkeyed over to gryffindor castle while hufflepuffs were sent to hufflepuff and the ravenclaw house sent to ravenclaw palace there the children were well watched over as aurors and mediwitches tended to them the gryffindors of hogwarts were now finally settled as queen lily and lady sapphire helped to calm them fear was written clearly across each and every one of their faces as many of their class and house mates were currently being tended to by mediwitches up in the hospital wing king james entered his study chambers in haste as he made the doors swing angrily upon their hinges his face was contorted in worry and anxiety dumbledore entered beside him as remus and tonks entered behind him and where are the slytherin students asked king james concern and worry swimming through his words dumbledore strode in next to him his face solemn and strained his pale skin was almost ghostly and the wrinkles in his face seemed to deepen in his worry they have been split between the two kingdoms of hufflepuff and ravenclaw they are currently being heavily guarded and watched by aurors as we speak but slytherin house has been quite empty for the past three months all students worth suspecting have not shown up at hogwarts since the christmas break said dumbledore and the death toll james asked dumbledore stopped for a moment his gaze downcast as he willed himself to answer a total of 34 students he said quietly james could see the silver tears lining the man wise blue eyes thirty four students he thought thirty four innocent children king james nodded sullenly and let out a sigh as he stood behind his writing desk how could this have happened albus he asked exhaustion spelled across his face dumbledore looked solemnly to the king before him and shook his head sadly how is bill weasley doing again james sighed he looked up at the headmaster as he tucked a small golden case into his robes once that was done he reached his arm out and began guiding the headmaster remus and tonks out of the study come let us see how he is and with that they exited the room as they reached the hospital wing james could hear the deep sobbing of a very dear friend molly weasley he inhaled deeply as he prepared himself for what was about to come he felt horrible for he knew of the pain the weasley were suffering for he suffered quite a similar pain 18 years ago james noticed remus lagging behind slightly and his heart went out to his best friend he understood his weariness quite well as well but no matter how prepared james tried to make himself he could never have expected to see what he saw as he entered deep gashes slashes and bite marks marred his body his cream skin was now a sickly purple in the areas he was lucky werentattacked the mediwitches were bandaging his arms and legs at the moment in white cloth as another dabbed at the scars that ran across his torn facial muscles james felt his emotions bubble within him for the weasley were family to him and their kids like sons he had watched all seven of them grow from birth to adulthood seeing bill in such conditions was no different than seeing his own son harry like this molly continued to sob as she grasped her son swollen hand tightly she whispered soft words into his ears as she cried on ginny sitting worriedly beside her molly rocked back and forth in her chair as arthur squeezed her shoulders for once he was not trying to stop her tears she had every right to them as he did coursing tears silently ran down the auror slim face as he prayed over his son battered body we are lucky he kept telling himself bill is still alive with wounds that can be healed we are lucky an hour had passed and bill bodily wounds had all been tended too but his face was till exposed as a mediwitch tended to his slashed face james and dumbledore had left to check up on the hogwarts students and the other two kingdoms hogwarts was now deserted at the moment after being evacuated in haste due to the ongoing attacks owls upon owls were flying in carrying letters from worried parents demanding their children be sent home immediately dumbledore left to handle the raging parents suggesting that it be safer to leave the students in the castle for the time being meanwhile back in the hospital wing bill was beginning to come to his groggy groans echoed off of the hight arched ceilings of the hospital wing as he tried to avoid the potent stinging ointment that the witch was currently applying all over his face the woman tsked tsked him as she battled to clean the rest of his wounds then suddenly the doors of the wing flung open as a glowing white figure strode hastily into the hospital it wasntuntil she had reached the third bed from bill did ginny recognize the female through her tears as none other than the ravenclaw courtier fleur delacour her blonde hair glistened in the candlelight as it flew behind her and her silvery blue gown swished and swayed around her slender form as she hurried her way up to her fiance oh billy she cried as she reached his bedside immediately she froze as her breath caught at the sight of his mangled appearance ginny watched her closely eyeing her through her slightly slanted eyes to her great surprise fleur immediately flung herself atop the wounded auror as murmured soft words of endearment fleur croaked billy softly as he managed to raise his arm around her back fleur sniffed against his chest as she lifted her head to at him her fingers gingerly touching his cheek who who did zis she demanded softly at first then she rose to her full height as her anger flared who did zis to billy his name is fenrir greyback came a voice from the doors of the wing fleur gaze shot in the direction of the voice her eyes welling with tears as she focused on the figure beside the doors king james grey greyback she asked shocked no it cant be she said as she turned her gaze back upon the man she loved but zat would mean her sentence ended with a gasp as her hands flew to her mouth she shook her head softly as she mumbled words of disbelief behind her palms she then once again flung her arms around his neck mindful of his wounds as she cried into him billy sighed and held her as close as he could with his wounds as he tried to comfort her james stood there as he watched the family his heart tore at the sight of them and he prayed inwardly that harry was safe then as fleur had just done moments before another pair of slippered feet echoed through the wing as the sound of pounding feet reached their ears suddenly a wave of honey brown curved around the corner and barreled into james with an amazing force james looked down and raised his eyebrows at his daughter in law within his arms he knew why she was here and he knew that her tears of fear would soon turn to tears of worry as soon as she learned of the details please she sobbed softly into his chest please tell me harry safe she begged james couldnthelp but smile sadly at her tearing emotions he wrapped his arms gently around her form with a hand resting upon her back and upon the back of her head shh he murmured yes my dear harry safe he could feel hermione tensed back muscles relax a bit as she gave in to her tears tears of relief she didntknow why but she just had a really bad feeling that harry life was in serious danger at the moment and she needed reassurance that all this was false james smiled at her as he pulled her to him in a fatherly embrace he looked up to see serenity before them smiling before she turned her attention to the wounded auror and his fiancee james watched as her expression slowly changed from relief to melancholy despair he only wished there was a way to help her serenity continued to watch the two as she felt something pull at her heart seeing fleur spill over her fiance as she addressed his wounds reminded her so much of herself and li oh how she yearned for him now she really did need him and she wasntsure how much longer she could take with him away james watched serenity with concern as he coaxed hermione to relax but that was soon going to end as dumbledore and remus came bursting into the wing once more james panted remus as he reached his best friend what what is it moony remus gave him another look and james could feel his body tensing again what now its hufflepuff it seems there has been a kidnap xxx sirius sat at the writing desk within harry sleeping tent as he went over different maps and scrolls he had a bad feeling now but he wasntsure how to address it what was he to do what were they going to do everything seemed so foggy and surreal at the moment ron and harry stood behind sirius as ron prepared himself for leave harry had released him to return to the castle to be with his brother for it was only right ron greatly appreciated it and hastily stuffed the small leather pouch with few essential as he stuffed his cloak into the pouch harry decided to go over a few last minute reminders now ron remember to tell my father about the but his sentence was suddenly interrupted as a shot of orange came zooming through the tent flaps watch out harry lunged forward as ron whipped his wand out reflexively as harry barreled into him knocking him over the cot and onto the fur covered floorings sirius immediately shot up from his seat wand in hand ready to go harry he called out ron we re ok came ron voice the two men got up as sirius ran to the tent flaps pulling them back roughly as he took a look at the auror camp what met his eyes then he couldntbelieve their camp was under attack harry ron get up he yelled as he pulled on his leather vest quickly the two didntneed to be told twice as they scrambled to their feet quickly readying their wands and preparing to fight harry quickly bolted out of the tent as sirius followed him but ron stayed put for a moment his face contorting into a look of queasy fear pausing for a moment he gulped audibly before nodding as he mustered up all his remaining gryffindor courage and bolting out of the tent after harry and sirius death eaters swarmed the campsite as aurors fought back the strength of the aurors secretly surprised the death eaters as they bent their will on one thing alone to kill everyone harry dodged blows as he rolled his body against the cool earth the death eaters were everywhere as he shot attacks at the cloaked monsters harry locked onto the mongrels of voldemort his attention never straying that is until a certain voice called out his name harry immediately harry turned his gaze to where the voice was coming from it seemed to have been coming from the woods to the north east without a second thought harry rounded his path and took off for the forest the deeper he got the closer the screams of the woman seemed to get harry please help it cried let go of me just then a swoosh was heard as if magic being casted before a loud smack echoed throughout the trees the soft grunting of a hit woman filled the forest and harry immediately took off in hopes of reaching her in time as he reached the small patch of moss the girl was now laying face down upon harry quickly ran over grasping hold of her shoulders as he turned her body around then he immediately froze is it really he thought but his thoughts were interrupted by another worried voice from behind cho xxx ok here it is oh ho ho ho what does this crazy author have in store now hmm hehe lets just

two the dark lord has risen xxx that s weird serenity said hermione raised an eyebrow what there seems to be nothing wrong with you at all hermione was taken aback but didnthave time to ponder on this as another wave of pain coursed through her she ducked her head low as serenity tired to aid her the best she could then suddenly a spark went off in hermione head as she suddenly knew what was wrong she quickly shot to her feet pressing her palm to the wall to steady her swaying body hermione i know what it is she said softly it harry he in trouble xxx harry back pressed into the cold stone behind him as he stared at the talking bundle of blankets in the traitor arms it wriggled as wormtail carried it frighteningly up to the conjured cauldron as it bubbled and hissed it was a sickening yellow color and harry watched in fear and uncertainty as he watched his father traitorous former friend hold the bundle of blankets high over the cauldron rim his scar still burned unnaturally as it thrummed painfully against his skull he could feel his blood pulsing within him as his head caused a high pitched sound to go off in his ears he had never before felt a pain like this well never before but once harry tried to turn his head around trying to take his mind off of the pain and trying to steal a glance at the other two he had portkeyed over with but the binds proved too strong as they held his face forward restricting his every move i hope they are alright he watched in horror as wormtail then dropped the bundle into the bubbling cauldron it continued to hiss the sound getting louder as harry could hear the bundle drop to the bottom instantly after the concoction began to change as it began to bubble excessively a new swirl of color mixing into it as the potion changed from a sickly yellow to a dull rust color harry noticed as wormtail now began to tremble he looked around for a second as if not sure of what to do next before he pulled a small dagger from the sleeve of his cloak harry eyes widened as he the traitor began to advance holding out the slim dagger in his maimed hand harry began to struggle as he watched wormtail drop to his knee before the prince harry began throwing curses to the rat like man before him as best he could but without his wand in his hand it was useless where was his wand anyway oh just hush up came wormtail squeaky voice harry made to retort but wormtail hushed him back handing him hard before grabbing harry shoulder harry eyes widened as wormtail grabbed the fabric of his sleeve tearing it he then pressed the tip if the dagger into his flesh earning a blossoming drop of blood to pearl at the wound before trailing freely down his arm wormtail pressed a vial to the wound as he collected a few drops of harry blood harry continued to struggle as wormtail corked the vial and stood a dull pain aching his shoulder you traitorous slime harry yelled wormtail didntseem to care as he turned unfazed returning to the bubbling black cauldron harry watched as he prayed for the creature to have died drowned please merlin let it have drowned blood of the enemy forcibly taken you will resurrect your foe wormtail said he watched as wormtail tipped the vial into the cauldron and harry was shocked to see the liquid change from a rust to a now blood red what happened next harry could not bear to witness as he watched wormtail bring the trembling dagger to his wrist harry immediately turned his face as best he could squeezing his eyes shut tight as her heard wormtail emit a shrill scream of pain following the pain came his shaky voice flesh of the servant willingly given you will revive your master harry still refused to watch as he heard a loud thunk followed by a loud billowing sound of steam harry insides were churning as he could feel what ever it was he had eaten earlier threaten to rise his body ached from the binds that held him to the stone cutting into his skin the cold stone flooring of the hall helped to pain his back as he was uncomfortable pressed against the stone he once again tried to turn his head hoping that this time he could get a good glance at the two behind him once again the binds held him tight he sighed as he chanced a glance at the writhing figure upon the stony surface a pool of blood had collected below the traitor as he stumbled to get his wand with his other hand trembling horribly he pointed the wand to the now stump of his arm muttering a curse to help stop the blood flow his cries still reverberated off of the stony walls as harry watched the bubbling steaming potion before him with apprehension and fear meanwhile pressed into a small alcove in the back of the large cold hall cho awoke with a start her eyes fluttered open as an aching pain traveled throughout her small body she could feel her body pressed against something soft as she moved raising her head slightly she saw the familiar straight nose and mahogany hair of hufflepuff prince cedric diggory immediately she scrambled to her knees as she called out his name is a hoarse whisper she grabbed his shoulders softly as she began to shake him tears welling in her eyes as she continued but he still didntwake she then noticed the small dribble of blood that fell from his lips and the tears fell as she touched his pale face she pressed her palm to his chest and then immediately gasped he was breathing not knowing what to do she cupped his cheeks in her hands as she pulled his face up slightly calling out his name some more then a low groan was heard from the prince tears continued to spill as she combed his hair from his face oh thank merlin you are all right she muttered softly he managed to smile softly before he tossed his head back softly pressing it against the cold stone moaning as a strong wave of pain coursed through him he could see the growing concern in cho eyes as he put a hand to her slender shoulder how how did started cho but she was immediately cut off by a cry of pain and a loud hiss both cho and cedric then shot their heads in the direction of the scream and they both froze quite a distance away a short figure stood crouching before a steaming cauldron he was clutching his arm in one hand as the area surrounding the steaming cauldron fogged up there was also a protruding stone which stuck up from the stone floor and it had thick green vines wrapped tightly around it cho squinted her eyes as she tried her best to make out what it was tied to it and her eyes widened in shock from either side a hand protruded and she recognized the gold ring of the royal family of gryffindor almost immediately clasping her hands above her mouth she knew exactly who it was tied to the stone before the steaming cauldron harry cedric had been too fixated to have noticed her distress and was startled as she began to frantically check her cloak and her dress for something he immediately grabbed her shoulders wincing almost immediately as a fresh wave of pain swept his body cho he whispered in haste be quiet dontdraw attention to yourself you dontknow what they might do cho looked to him quickly and shrugged his hands off quickly as she continued to search cedric you dontunderstand she whispered i had something something i need to give to harry upon hearing her say harry name a short lived wave of jealousy coursed through him as he remembered her love for the prince almost as fast as he had felt it it washed away as he knew she wouldnttake that course again she was his now and that filled his heart with warmth he then nodded as he looked about the foreign hall we must be in slytherin castle he muttered as he took in the grotesque snake like gargoyles that wrapped around the many columns and balconies that overlooked the hall from above he shuddered as he shot another uneasy look over to where the steam was still billowing from the cauldron how long was that going to take he wondered a while i hope where is it hissed the girl beside him he turned as she finally looked up what is it you are look aha she whispered as she leapt forward on her knees seizing the small golden locket that had fallen from harry hand once he had portkeyed over mindful not to touch the actual locket cho gently grasped the golden chain before plunging it into a velvety blue pouch on her waist cho wontyou transport back if you touch it cedric asked cho shook her head i have bewitched the pouch to block the spell cho explained as long as it is in this pouch we wonttransport until we take it out cedric nodded quickly before turning back to the horrific scene a few ways before them they could make out the small figure cowering on the floor nursing a bloody stump as he sat within a pool of blood how he got that way the two didntknow and neither wanted to find out as they both wished they could be once again unconscious they both knew this was only the calm before the storm and if this was calm they both feared what was coming next xxx hermione stumbled painfully into her father in law study serenity just behind her he was currently surrounded by a hoard of aurors as they all discussed military tactics it seemed king james was now discussing with rufus scrimgeor and the head of hufflepuff unit of aurors jacob connolly about sending reinforcements into slytherin to aid the aurors james still didntknow of the attack but he feared after the kidnap of cho chang that his aurors may need backup as he discussed this with the two men hermione burst into the office chambers james immediately sensed that she was in pain and he quickly made his way over to her hermione what in bloody hell the king started harry in trouble she panted her eyes were still squinted in pain and she had fresh tears running down her cheeks her wand was grasped tightly in her one hand as she stumbled into him king james did his best to keep her standing as she babbled worriedly about harry whoa wait hermione what are you talking about what do you mean harry in trouble he asked half confused and half suspicious how would she know but before she had a chance almost on queue a sound was heard coming from james robe pocket the entire chamber turned their attention to the voice that was coming from their king james looked shocked for a moment before thrusting his hand into his robes prongs prongs we need back up send back up immediately the entire chamber recognized the voice immediately and serenity face paled as she heard the voice of her father booming from the small golden case in his hands she quickly made her way over to hermione side as she stared frighteningly at the case james opened the case to reveal a small mirror within it upon it was the face of his best friend sirius padfoot he asked in confusion he could faintly hear the commotion in the background as screams and curses flew james heart sped up quickly as hermione gasped covering her mouth with her hands padfoot what on earth is going on we are under attack james you must send back up our men are being slaughtered out here james paled as he turned to look straight at sir jacob no words were exchanged as the head of hufflepuff unit of aurors nodded his head in understanding he quickly bowed slightly in respect to james we will dispatch right away he told the king james nodded appreciatively oh and please send word to the longbottom s tell frank and alice that i am sending them to aid as well they are some of my best aurors have them depart with hufflepuff yes sire sir jacob said before turning and leaving with a swish of his cloak rufus scrimgeor too bowed slightly as he turned to the king and i shall see to it that a legion of my best aurors is dispatched as soon as possible sire james nodded his appreciation before turning back to the small mirror in his hands sirius he called his voice urgent and forceful as remus quickly ran up behind him peering over his shoulder sirius where harry hermione could feel her heart rate increase to new heights as she awaited the man answer the long pause that met their ears was painstakingly torturous each fearing the worst but trying their best to pray that they were wrong the pain in hermione forehead began to intensify as she could barely contain her rapid breathing james looked to her worry etched across his tired features as he silently begged sirius to answer with good news harry prongs i don t sirius james cut him off where is harry where is my son xxx harry continued to struggle against his bonds as he watched in horror the scene before him this steam continued to billow upward and an eerie glow lit the cold hall with a deadly glare turning his head the extent allowed harry quickly noticed his discarded wand lying not 10 feet from where he now was bound if only i could get it before anyone sees me he thought as he spread his fingers out preparing to us a summoning spell to get his wand but fate wasntas kind to the prince as a menacing laugh reverberated off of the stone walls snapping the prince attention back to the bubbling cauldron harry squinted through the steam as he tried to locate the body behind the laugh then harry eyes immediately widened in shock and fear as a figure began to stand from within the cauldron tall and thin the misted body shook with evil robe me immediately wormtail scrambled to his feet as he disappeared into the foggy mist harry could make out the faint outline of the two as the body was dressed then to harry utmost surprise the figure stepped forward stepping out of the cauldron and in plain sight before harry harry instantly gasped as he took in the sight of ghostly pale skin skeletal body and scarlet slits that shone as his eyes harry scar immediately began to sear as he took in the sight before him he was now staring into the face of the wizarding world most feared enemy ever lord voldemort voldemort then laughed an evil hollow laugh that chilled harry to the bone harry wanted nothing more than to turn his face from the grotesque figure before him but found it impossible no matter how hard he tired hello harry came the cold voice of the man before him harry didntknow what to do as he stood stock still against the stone immediately a bolt of excruciating pain filled his forehead as he strained to keep his eyes open not wanting to give this monster the advantage of getting to him unfortunately the pain was far too strong for him to ignore as he let out a low groan the figured lord before him chuckled as he regarded his prisoner his cold red eyes examined him maliciously as he glared with a look of evil his aura filling with an unearthly evil there was no denying who this monster was as he stood before the prince in long dark robes his tall thin snake like body slithered as it made its way over to the bounded prince his sneer was icy and the glint in his eye only meant torture was brewing within his twisted mind revenge as he got closer harry boxed his shoulders trying to stand his ground that he wasntafraid of this monster this earned an evil chuckle from the figure before him as it advanced are you afraid of me harry he asked his evil slits for eyes glistening blood red harry unsure of how to answer scoffed afraid of you ha he answered he could hear wormtail in the background as he gasped while voldemort before him looked amused i killed you once i can do it again harry sneered this earned the prince another amused expression from the one before him as he raised his eyebrows and cocked his head to the side killed me did you he asked harry didntflinch as he stared the creature down he only narrowed his eyes more as if confirming the question i will admit it i did miscalculate my attack upon you but do not think you destroyed me no he muttered as he drew closer to harry you may have killed my former body but my soul did remain and that is what you should be fearing above all his whisper was low and sinister it sent pain shooting down his spine from his scar as he did this drawing ever closer to the prince but i will not give you the chance to do the same oh no i am going to make you suffer as you have never suffered before he sneered tracing a cold spindly finger down harry cheek there is no mother here to protect you this time his words inflamed an anger so deep within harry he was sure the very bonds keeping him restrained were going to burn fire flickered within the prince eyes a deep scarlet and gold that burned with a strength and determination that both amused and annoyed the dark lord i am going to destroy you voldemort just you wa but before he could finish voldemort pointed his fingers to harry chest muttering in a low amused voice crucio harry body immediately began go convulse as tremendous waves of pain coursed throughout his body the ear splitting shriek that resonated within his ears only gave reason for his scar to burn more furiously as pain attacked his entire body he did everything within his power not to cry out as he battled with the curse after what seemed like hours to harry passed did the pain subside leaving aches and shoots of pain to remain harry panted as he tried to regain his breath before shooting a menacing look to the dark lord this only made voldemort smile as he regarded the prince had enough dontworry i am not anywhere near done with you m boy voldemort spoke softly his voice held an amused tone to it as he waited almost two decades to do this before i am through with you i doubt even your precious wife will even be able to recognize you hearing this a pained spark shot through harry heart as his eyes widened in shock and fear hermione harry then threw his gaze over to wormtail as a wave of pure and unbridled hatred coursed through him of course there were other sources that could have fed voldemort information concerning his flowering relationship with hermione but at the moment harry wanted nothing more than to rip into wormtail blaming him for all of this harry eyes narrowed his head hung low from the earlier crucio attack but his eyes burned through his bangs as he looked up at the creature before him once more i will destroy you voldemort make no doubt about that he let out in a low menacing whisper voldemort only quirked an eyebrow is that so he asked his head cocked to the side harry burning gaze pierced through him hatred and disgust swimming through his gryffindorian veins wormtail untie him and give him his wand the short chunky man that once befriended and annoyed the royal family of gryffindor scrambled to his feet as he made haste to follow his new master orders as he was told he pointed his short wand at harry chest muttering a low spell that immediately released the bonds harry could feel the bonds slacken as his slumping body dropped to the floor making him land on one knee and harry was sure he fractured his knee cap on the hard stone gasping softly at the feel of free movement he winced as he arms ached not only from the curse but also from the strain he was forced to put on his upper body his entire body was in excruciating pain as he made to get up he felt something hard hit him in the arm and he turned his head to see his wand now lying mere inches from his splayed fingers he looked up at wormtail and slightly delighted in the way the traitor squirmed under his intense gaze he sighed liking the feel of fear as he grasped his wand harshly he pushed himself off of the stone floor as he stood before the snake like villain before him voldemort regarded him with a sour smile one that held naught but pure desire to torture this surprisingly didntbother harry as he boxed his shoulders once more standing his ground proudly he stuck out his chest proudly thrusting the emblem of gryffindor out as he gripped his wand he wasntsure what exactly was going to happen as he stared voldemort in the eye voldemort it seemed was enjoying this quiet silence and harry was sure a flicker of death shot through his blood red eyes voldemort then began to take a few steps to the right as he began to walk in a circular fashion harry began to mimic his actions as the two rounded the other like a pair of wolves preparing to jump the other when the right time presented itself harry kept a watchful eye upon his enemy as he took in all of his movements remus had been sure to teach harry to recognize different signs of movement so that he could try and predict the next move it was a good technique since harry wasntgryffindor best occlumens he would have to make due with what he could as voldemort took another step to the right harry noticed his long white fingers flinch as he gripped his wand with a little more strength harry immediately acted on reflex as he tightened his own grip on his wand watching the robed figure as a hawk would watch its prey voldemort then stopped back in the same spot as he had been when harry was released form the stone he sneered and harry immediately caught on as voldemort thrusted his wand into the air calling out torture curse as harry retaliated harry immediately leapt to the right as the curse blasted the stone block that was once behind him landing on his shoulder to the side harry pointed his wand up at voldemort screaming out another curse as voldemort sent a green blaze skimming past his left ear thus beginning their duel corpus mortificus expelliarmus both dodged the attacks as harry scrambled to his feet he noticed wormtail had scrambled to the corner hiding beside the large iron throne as he wept and mumbled about his maimed arm wallowing in self pity harry wanted nothing more than to shoot a curse in the traitor direction but he kept his sole attention upon the monster before him colorful curses went whizzing in every direction as the two battled on as each continued to call out curses neither had landed a single curse and harry was beginning to feel tight strains in his arms and legs as his muscles shook and trembled with his every movement voldemort moved languidly as he avoided the prince curses it was almost as if he were toying with the prince harry anger bubbled at the thought as he threw himself upon the floor rolling over to the right once more as he quickly called out a curse but to his great surprise voldemort was no longer standing where harry had last seen him he looked about for a second before a loud pop was heard behind him suddenly harry felt the tip of a wand press into his back as a low cynical voice whispered out its curse prorupta audacia harry eyes widened as he felt the white hot curse burn his back as it exploded behind him blasting him twenty feet across the stony hall harry allowed a small cry to escape him as he slid stomach down against the stone his back burned as he could feel his back blistering from the heated curse shaking harry struggled to stand despite the searing pain that spread hotly behind him harry picked himself up and stood his shoulders slumping and his upper torso leaning forward his breathing was ragged and his scar continued to burn intensively voldemort only smirked in content as he watched the prince struggle he truly found no other enjoyment than to see his enemy torture but this enemy nothing could nor would ever top what it was he felt at seeing the blood trickle from his torn lip or the smell of burned flesh upon his back this truly was all that he was waiting for since harry deflected that killing curse so many years ago he was glad he didntkill him earlier for this was far more enjoyable than sudden death no this was much better he watched as harry brought the back of his hand up to his lip wiping away the leaking blood as he didntonce break eye contact with his foe he noticed the smile upon his features and sneered enjoying yourself riddle he asked referring to the monster muggle name immediately he received the effect he had wanted as the smug smile of lord voldemort quickly fell to be replaced by one of the wickedest sneers harry had yet to see you d be wise to watch your words young prince you stand on thin ice as it is voldemort retorted his eyes were as cold as said ice his thin lips pursed in anger harry suddenly felt a wave of fear and panic spread throughout his body he didntunderstand this as it left as quickly as it had come what why did i just but whatever it was he was thinking was suddenly cut off as another curse flew his way cho and cedric watched in horror as they witnessed the battle unfold before them cedric was thankful that he had flown into the alcove that the two were currently lying in for it was out of the sight of the feuding pair right before their line of sight was a massive marble column that obscured them cedric could feel as cho nails dug into his arm worry etched all over her delicate face cedric hated that they both were caught in a serious dilemma torn between wanting to help and wanting to stay safe yet both knew that it was not their battle to fight in cho sat in worry and in fear as she watched harry dodge the attacks as his burned back pained him she could tell for his movements were tentative as he tried his best to restrict as much of his movements as he could she wanted to help and it physically hurt her to sit and watch unable to help in any way the only comfort she had at the moment was to keep the locket safe and as far away as possible she was thoroughly surprised when she found it on the stone floor forgotten as wormtail concluded his concoction of revival if only she could safely wait cedric she said hastily as she turned to him he gave her a look that said to keep her voice down before quirking an eyebrow the best he could to answer her what he muttered in a low almost inaudible voice she turned to him her eyes serious and determined for a moment before she began to fiddle around her gathering up her skirts and standing up slightly immediately he went to pull her back down but she just pulled him up with her pressing him against the wall of the alcove as she leaned into him do you remember how voldemort got to harry so quickly cedric nodded though confused as to why she was asking such an odd question yes he apparated it seemed cho nodded exactly cedric still gave her a quizzical look before realization dawned that means that there arentany disapparation charms cast she said as she wrapped her arms around his waist time to go and with that cho closed her eyes as a soft pop was heard they were gone almost immediately voldemort shot his crimson eyes in the direction of the sound and harry heart almost dropped to his knees as he too turned to look upon his two friends then to his surprise he noticed the alcove in which they were once in to be empty and harry knew then that they had apparated out smiling he turned to voldemort who now narrowed his blood red eyes upon wormtail wormtail the locket did you secure it voldemort yelled harry noticed wormtail begin to shake heavily in fear as he scrambled to his feet stuttering nonsense voldemort cold eyes narrowed further and looked as if death were swimming throughout them seeing an opportunity harry quickly aimed his wand at the dark lord expelliarmus he cried as voldemort wand flew out of his hand his eyes widened as harry was before him in seconds and he watched in horrified surprise as harry drew back his fist before thrusting it forward as it made contact with the cold snakelike skin of his enemy cheek the pain harry felt from the impact didntregister as he watched voldemort stumble he then went to do it again but as his fist got closer a cold hand grabbed it mere inches from his face voldemort had caught his fist enough games you shall die now and with that he began to squeeze harry enclosed fist tighter than harry would have ever expected he could almost feel his very bones cracking under pressure as voldemort continued to squeeze with unnatural force harry refused to drop to his knees as the pain filled his hand he didntknow what to do as pain began to fog his thoughts all he wanted to do was make it stop but he refused to surrender no he would not surrender to this monster as the pain grew and he could feel his bones giving into the pressure as they began to crack suddenly out of where he knew not an amazing amount of strength seemed to pass through him as he suddenly ripped his fist from the villain grasp leaping back a few feet harry stumbled to his feet for a moment then tested his hand as he tried to open his fist instantly pain shot through him and harry knew his fingers were partially broken luckily it had been his left fist for his wand hand was still workable he could hear voldemort voice in the back ground accio wand harry heard him summon as his wand flew back into his hand now harry potter you shall die once and for all and with that his quickly aimed his wand at harry chest harry eyes widened avada kedevra he yelled harry immediately reacted as he pointed his wand back to the dark lord before him expelliarmus the two spells shot from both wands at amazing speeds as a jet of green blasted from the tip of voldemort wand blue shot forth from harry as the two jets met in mid cast harry wand shook violently as it heated up exceptionally fast harry stood there shocked and confused as he realized just what had happened the two spells and joined in the center creating a golden stream of light that connected the two wands harry wand continued to shake as he noticed voldemort shock how could this have happened he thought as he regarded the connecting light but suddenly it began to glow stronger as the shaking of harry wand became almost incontrollable and he felt that he would burn his hand lest he drop his wand but something told harry at that moment not to break the connection this connection may be the only thing that could save him from death bearing through the burning heat harry grasped the wand as tight as he could putting forth all of his strength to keep the golden thread whole but now what xxx meanwhile havoc was breaking loose at the aurors camp out death eaters swarmed the area as they battled on with the aurors of gryffindor sirius had come bursting out of the tent that belonged to harry just moments ago after contacting with james asking for more help but another thing was now weighing on his mind where is harry he continued to run throughout the now battleground as he searched for his godson dodging curses and retaliating a few times he continued out his search until he was face to face with a smaller cloaked figure stopping he stood before the figure with an air of arrogance about him the figure laughed looking for someone are we sirius the voice asked sirius didntgive the figure the satisfaction of seeing his surprise but internally he was shocked but instead he smiled an arrogant smile as he recognized the voice of his opponent why hello trixy fancy meeting you here how the family he asked his grin of confidence only angering the figure even more then a small white hand extended from the sleeves of the figure black robes as it made to pull down its hood sirius smiled as he looked into the face of the one before him bellatrix lestrange i ve told you before cousin never to call me that she spat though her evil smile never fading from her features sirius only raised an eyebrow and since when did i ever take orders from you this made her face contort into a look of fury before she controlled herself and smirked once more i d watch my cockiness sirius if i were you the dark lord does not take kindly to disrespect bellatrix spat once more sirius regarded her a now bored expression fell upon his features then as if an afterthought she added what a shame to the name of black have you become i would advise to you dear cousin that you lie before our dark lord and beg his forgiveness whilst you still can perhaps our black name wouldntbe so shameful anymore sirius sneered now as he quirked an eyebrow he would see her fury building within her eyes as she spoke true heartfelt words sirius didntcare she was delusional and a fool the only time i will ever lie before your lord is as a corpse he retorted bellatrix eyes squinted in anger before a smirk pulled at her lips so be it then and with that she shot a blazing curse his way sirius dodged it easily before shooting back his own curse sirius could vaguely make out the rest of the camp battle site as he battled his father niece oh how he despised his family spells shot here and there but everything was moving too quickly for one to truly follow the attacks after a good 20 minutes into the duel bellatrix managed to trip sirius causing him to stumble backwards laughing she quickly held her wand out before her avada ked she began sirius fell and watched in fear as he heard her choice of curse but before the words could have left her mouth and amazing beam of light rammed into her chest flinging her a good 20 feet behind her she skidded onto her back as she groaned unable to move due to the impact of the attack sirius immediately turned to the one who aided him and instantly smiled in shock and relief li li what are you doing here he asked as the elven guardian held a hand out aiding his king to his feet sirius gladly took but not before noticing the wounds he sported merlin what is happening to you li pulled sirius to his feet and was pleased to notice that his king was in healthy condition before guiding him back into the heavily battling site sirius stopped stopping li as well li sirius said firmly li turned to sirius sire we do not have the time i have brought aid sirius then turned and noticed the deep emerald and golden uniforms of his wife people army he watched for a second as they effectively maneuvered and attacked their forms of attack quite different from those of the aurors but please your majesty we must hurry and with that li grabbed his upper arm as he led sirius throughout the different tents and campfires as they avoided dueling aurors and death eaters as they reached the edge of the campsite beside the looming forest li then stopped sirius li what is going on sirius asked in an annoyed confused manner li quickly turned to the man beside him before checking around to make sure they were temporarily safe and alone sire i do not believe you heard of the hufflepuff kidnapping correct at this sirius eyes widened no what happened who was kidnapped when did this hap but sirius chain of questions was stopped as li held up a quick hand please we do not have much time all will be answered in due time but you must know started li it had been the courtier cho chang that had been kidnapped sirius once again looked shocked at the news cho chang he repeated li nodded yes but that is not all she carried a powerful object within her possession as well a powerful object what do you mean i believe she had with her one of the last two rumored horcruxes left to be destroyed li told him sirius widened even more as he took in this information so where is she how did she get the horcrux li then shook his head i do not know but then as if on queue a soft pop was heard not too far away from where they were standing it seemed to have come from within the forest sirius immediately drew his wand as li prepared himself to battle but they both quickly stopped as two figures stumbled out of the forest edge cho chang and cedric diggory sirius then ran up to the two as cho was supporting a limping cedric against her oh thank merlin the two heard her mutter as sirius reached her side cho what happened are you alright yes yes we are alright but i believe cedric here is in horrible pain cho said urgently as she looked up at sirius li had quickly made it to cedric side and she smiled gratefully as he began to ease her load of the prince cho where is the horcrux do you still have it sirius asked her cho nodded quickly as she pulled the small velvet pouch from her side yes thank merlin that rodent of a man didnttake it she muttered partially to herself she didntnotice sirius stony expression though she watched for a second as li led cedric over to a nearby stone to set him upon before moving to heal his seemingly fractured leg then she quickly turned to sirius sir quickly you must send your band of aurors into the castle sirius looked at her and eyebrow rose in both question and worry but before he had a chance to question her she continued hurry harry life is in danger immediately sirius grabbed her and pulled her to the left his expression now contorted in deep worry harry where is he cho pointed to the distant castle and watched as sirius face drained of all color he is with voldemort xxx james raced down the hall as he swerved the corner leading to the apparation chamber all thought was bent on getting to his son dumbledore and remus were right beside the king as they too sped along the gryffindorian royal corridors lily who had just recently learned off all that was going on was also speeding behind her husband worry etched clearly across her delicate features hermione and serenity made up the back of the group as their elegant skirts swirled and swished around their legs silent tears were painting hermione soft cheeks as she was determined to get to her husband she could feel him feel his pain and it scared her how is this possible she thought to herself as she continued to run is this what queen lily was talking about when she claimed to have sensed king james hermione continued to battle with her thoughts as she prayed for harry safety but something dark something painful told her that harry was in major trouble he would have never left the campgrounds without telling sirius never something was definitely wrong and about the hufflepuff kidnapping how odd is that so you are positive hufflepuff has sent out its aurors came lily urgent and bothered voice hermione heard her father in law sigh yes lily i positive he told her and what of ravenclaw have you spoken to richard at hearing her father name hermione head quickly picked up as she listened closely to the king answer yes richard has already summoned his armies of aurors to his palace please lily trust me i am doing all that i can at his answer lily frown deepened i i do trust you james lily said with a hint of hurt james sighed as he slowed for a moment pausing to turn to his wife i sorry lily james told her as he pulled her to him lily seemed to want to pull back for a second before giving in to him as she released a wave of tears as she clutched at his back hermione watched the two and couldnthelp but feel a deep pain from watching their exchange suddenly then a searing shot of pain coursed through her and she immediately cried out in surprise clutching her left hand she winced as if she had crushed it against something hermione james voice was heard as he watched his daughter in law hermione looked up at him i i am alright hermione muttered softy she gripped her hand before releasing her fingers testing it out no pain issued anymore and it confused her i am fine but sire we must hurry i think harry is in serious trouble james nodded and the group was making their way back to the apparation chamber finally after what seemed like years to james they had arrived as they rushed in they were surprised to notice a flurry of red zoom in as well ginny james asked ginny looked up at the king what are you doing here your majesty i want to come with you she said sternly immediately james shook his head no but please uncle james i want to help then help out around the castle merlin knows your brother would love to have you helping out in the hospital wing stay here ginny you needntgo it isnta pleasant sight james told her but ginny was stubborn sire with all due respect regardless of what you say i will apparate there be it now or in a few minutes after you so please just allow me to come as it will make it easier on the both of us at this ginny has received grins from both dumbledore and serenity just let her come james we can use the extra help lily added eager to get to looking for her son james then sighed very well he replied ginny smiled as she made to stand before him then slowly one by one a pop was heard as they each apparated out of sight xxx draco watched through the hood of his cloak as his men battled on everything had been going well before a surprisingly strong band of fighters arrived who are they he wondered as he crept in the shadows he watched his men fight but suddenly things werentgoing as well now that these new fighters were strong and powerful mentally as well as physically with their magic they interested him but he didnthave time to be a spectator as his life was currently on the line if i do not return with a victory i will surely be killed draco thought in slight panic why was he chosen as the head of voldemort second battalion of death eaters secretly he was scared scared at the fact that one screw up no matter how insignificant could mean his life there was no room for mercy within the halls of his lord and the lord himself seemed colder and crueler than he had ever imagined then there was his father his father who so blatantly accused him of dishonor and embarrassment he now couldnthelp but feel resentment towards the man who had fathered him he would allow his son to take on a suicide mission and not think to blink against it did draco life mean anything to the man and if he were to fail tonight would he truly banish him from the only home he knew of as he continued to creep within the shadows he watched as sweat beaded along his brow for his men were falling faster than he could believe aurors were filling in by the minute as legions from ravenclaw and factions from hufflepuff entered the site what was he to do now surely his men wouldntbe able to hold out against the three kingdom best aurors and then he suddenly heard a series of popping noises coming from within the large scarlet tent mere feet before him his eyes widened as he watched the king of gryffindor emerge followed by dumbledore queen lily and remus hermione serenity and the youngest weasley named ginny quickly hurried out of the tent as well as they followed the king soundly draco knew if he could get to king james or to dumbledore even then his home in slytherin will remain secure and his life safe but before he had a chance to take any sort of action the ground beneath his feet began to shudder the air then filled with a heavy dense feeling of power as every magical being in the area could sense the growing amount of power within the air this seemed to gather a lot of attention and almost as if instinctual everyone heads turned to the direction of slytherin castle as they somehow knew that that was the origin of the power increase what in bloody hell what is going on xxx ok here it is i am very sorry for the delay for this chapter but seems to be having some major technical difficulties and it is preventing me from posting so i am sorry but as soon as ffnet opens portkey shall be the only update again sorry but i hope you enjoyed i hope you liked this chapter thanks again all sm131 disclaimer i own nothing but the plot hello readers to my fellow reviewers thank you so much for your reviews guys now on with the story xxxxxxxxxx chapter twenty four the dark side retaliates xxx a surge of angry power shot through harry as the determination to destroy this evil shot through him he would do it he would kill him tonight then as harry swore to himself through his hatred that he would kill this monster another emotion past through him love this shocked and stunned the prince in a moment where he thought he would only feel hatred the feelings for which he felt for his wife coursed through him stronger than he could have ever imagined and this new feeling washed over his entire being filling his every vein with a newfound strength that he couldntbelieve possible to muster this feeling was the most familiar feeling in the world to him it was simply hermione with this the feeling of hermione within him he suddenly felt an amazing boost of power within him and instantly felt his aura swell with strength as well shooting a look to hermione once more he caught her eyes and sent her a silent message before turning to his enemy once more this was it harry would destroy this evil tonight xxx a swirl of purple velvet filled the space between the trees as dumbledore made his way to the hiding spot of the lady cho and hufflepuff prince cedric he secured the golden locket within the very pouch cho had done earlier as he tied it tightly to the waist of his robes placing difficult charms as to not allow it to fall he ran at a fairly decent speed for a man of his age quick and swift he finally made his way past the emerald leaves and slowed to a swift walk as he heard the sound of rushing water finally nearing his destination he cut into the small glen where a beautiful skinny waterfall fell into a crystalline pool he recited a few incantations to allow him to enter the safety shield he had set up for protection the soft and almost inaudible hum of the shield momentarily stopped as he took a step forward the hum commenced immediately after indicating that the shield had gone up once more taking a few steps forward the sound of crunching leaves filled the air as cho and cedric emerged from beside a tree along the bank of the pool professor is everything alright cho asked concerned dumbledore smiled sadly as he peered at her through his half moon spectacles i am afraid i will not be able to supply the desired answer in which you seek lady cho but rest assured everyone is doing their very best now please we have some very import but what of harry cho interrupted have they gotten him out of there yet her shoulders were tense and her eyes piercing as she stared at her former headmaster cedric slowly came up behind her resting a kind hand upon her shoulders she visibly relaxed at his touch and sighed her nerves nearly shot please milady relax king james is taking care of that situation but that isntwhy i am here dumbledore told her i have a task i am in need of your help with so let us hurry i afraid we haventmuch time cedric i will need you to accompany me as well cedric nodded and cho look of puzzlement was pure as she tilted her head at the professor before her to aid her in her confusion dumbledore motioned to the pouch that hung from his waist cho eyes widened as she understood then nodded to the man before her oh yes i understand cho said softly dumbledore smiled as he reached for her arm guiding her forward so that they could leave the protected area but professor where are we going dumbledore didntturn to her as he led her towards the humming shield cedric was relieved as he was finally able to leave this protective bubble since sirius had instructed him to stay within the confines of the shield until he was sent for a dead prince of hufflepuff was not what they needed right now and regardless of the prince abilities sirius knew king amos would not appreciate his only son to participate in such a war this forest is filled with great evil we cannot possibly attempt to destroy such an object whilst in here that is why we must leave its vicinity cho nodded as they reached the shield dumbledore once again recited the incantation and the shield went down the two left and cho turned and gave cedric a look of foreboding as they swiftly followed the headmaster through the dense dark forest ginny watched in horror as she witnessed a few more of their men fall wounded and tired as the battles carried on she hated feeling helpless and useless and couldntstand hiding behind the protection of others when she was perfectly able to fight back but unfortunately neither her brother nor sirius felt it was safe for ginny when were they going to learn that she was no longer a child she could defend her self just as well as any of them fuming ginny was forced to sit back and watch like a spectator as the light faced off against the dark she wasntallowed to leave the protected space in which sirius had secured and was using as his command point he was already bloody and scarred from previous attacks and he looked as if he had lost much color in his face already ginny only hoped he was alright then as she stood there on the border of the protective area a flash of silver and navy caught her attention as she turned to her right quickly they emerged from the outskirts of the forest swiftly and ginny focused upon them as she tired to make their features out she squinted as the darkness of the night obscured her vision and froze as she noticed just exactly who it was she saw quickly ginny moved along the area of the shield she was encased in as she followed the trail of the figures what is going on she thought as she watched them disappear behind the panels of the many tents she continued to watch the spot in which they disappeared from before turning her attention over to the tree line of the forest and retracing their steps she replayed the sight over in her head for a moment before quickly turning in a flurry of skirts as she made her way to where the aurors were entering the shield standing beside the shield she waited for a few of the aurors to enter watching them and watching their line of sight as they billowed past her either injured shaken or energetic she threw sirius a quick look and smiled slightly as she noticed his whole attention was bent upon the aurors when one more auror uttered the password to enter she readied herself as he past her swiftly she gathered her cloak and skirts in her fists as she edged her way out of the shield taking a quick step to her right and turning she released her breath as she rapidly took a few steps to the side and up hiding herself in the shadows of a looming tent as she turned once more to sirius and his men a part of her felt extremely guilty for leaving the safety of the shield for all sirius and ron were doing was protecting her but something told her she had to do this she had to know what was going on and if she could she had to help inhaling one quick breath she pulled her wand out of her cloak and quickly began making her way towards the tents she had seen the figures disappear behind xxx dumbledore stopped as cho and cedric halted behind him at the mouth of a jagged and ominous cave at the foot of a tall menacing mountain this cave scared cho immensely she allowed her eyes to travel northward to the sky and shivered unconsciously in the shadow of the death exuding mountain what are we doing here dumbledore then turned to cedric m boy this is where we must part he told him cedric made to argue but dumbledore stopped him listen remember the path back here know this location for if help is needed you can lead them but hear this do not linger here you were summoned by lord sirius and he needs your aid and your people need your presence now go dumbledore continued and good luck cedric sent one last look to cho before nodding yes sir he said dumbledore smiled and placed a quick hand upon his shoulder cedric smiled briefly before turning in a swish of his cloak cho watched as he retreated and she prayed for his safety as she watched him disappear within the many tents once more she allowed a stray tear to fall before turning to the man beside her dumbledore smiled solemnly and turned to the cave behind them inhaling a deep breath xxx ginny quickly threw herself against one of the large scarlet and gold tents as a figure swept past her she quirked an eyebrow as she turned once more to take in his retreating form what is going on why is cedric going back she thought as she watched him disappear she quirked an eyebrow and dismissed it as she stealthily made her way through the shadows once more as she began to reach the outskirts of the campsite she found herself staring into the ugly side of a monstrous mountain its jagged cliffs jutted out dangerously and a dark shadow fell almost unnaturally upon it it was an eerie sight but what had caught the redhead attention was not the mountain but who were standing at the base of it dumbledore and cho ok what is going on why are they here she thought to herself as she hid herself behind a tree against the forest line beside the campsite she watched as dumbledore grasped cho shoulder for a moment and muttered soft words into her ear before guiding her into the mouth of the cave ginny stood there for a few moments unsure of what to do she just left the confines of protection to follow her former headmaster there was no way she could turn back now not with unanswered questions with that ginny pulled the dark hood of her cloak up over her head as she crept along the tree line quietly she reached the mouth of the cave and took a few quick looks about her making sure she was alone and unwatched before darting quickly into the dark and damp cave a shadowed figure allowed a small smile to pull at his lips as he watched the young maiden sneak after her headmaster this will be good xxx sweat was beading down harry temple as he continued to maintain a hold upon the pulsating connection that bound him to voldemort by the second the power and strength of this connection grew draining and pressuring harry body he had no idea how he was standing there but he was and as horrible as it may sound the sight of hermione there before him wounded and drained seemed to boost his energy he was ready ready for whatever may come he threw voldemort a menacing glare as he sneered which only made the man chuckle loudly what harry what is it do you think you can kill me is that it he mocked this petty game of connect the wands is doing nothing more than prolonging the inevitable sooner or later i will kill you and believe me you will be begging me to end your life as so many have done before you harry sneer grew and the angry monster in the pit of his stomach roared and clawed at him as his temper flared beyond its handle point he could feel his face filling with heat and blood and he could feel his every vein as his heart pumped blood into his limbs and his adrenaline peaked he shot a quick glance at his wife who knelt to voldemort left in perfect view of the prince her hair fell wildly about her and her dress was ripped and tattered no sign of blood seemed to fill her face except for the cuts in which it oozed from as she was as white as a ghost her eyes were dim and pained and her body fell slightly limp against her shackles and binds harry insides were ripping and his blood racing as she glanced at her she watched him intently silently urging him to be strong not to listen to voldemort and harry drank in her look she needed him and believed in him and that was all he needed to know he quickly glanced back at voldemort his hand shaking violently due to the force of the power within the connection and suddenly he felt as if he had been doused by a bucket of ice water the sneer so evil sent chills down harry spine and he truly dreaded what the dark lord had plotting harry watched as voldemort eyes slid toward the direction of his wife and watched his sneer evolve into a sick sadistic grin quite beautiful isntshe he said to himself not bad for a half breed harry look of disgust for the man grew do not be too quick to forget riddle that you too are a said half breed harry spat voldemort eyes riveted back unto harry and his look of hatred was one harry was quite used to seeing dare to push me do you prince so be it he countered bella bellatrix smiled a wicked smile as she turned her attention back onto the princess before her harry eyes widened in horror as she raised her wand at hermione hermione crucio hermione screams filled the room briefly before she bit her tongue to stop her screams and immediately harry heart tore at the sound the look of her being tortured before his very eyes destroyed him and it was all his fault again her whimper caught his ear as well as voldemort snicker of enjoyment and instantly harry aura swelled with anger and power harry robes flapped around him violently and suddenly a blast of power shot from the tip of his wand expanding the now silver thread of connection as a large power filled attack shot down the connection straight at voldemort the sudden impact of the burst of harry aura against his own and the blasted attack from harry wand voldemort found himself hurling back at incredible speed as he slammed into the wall behind the wall immediately crumbled and voldemort fell through as the stone wall fell atop him harry too was thrown back and he cried out as his still fresh blistering wound made hard contact with the cold stone wall pain shot through his body as he slid slightly slumping against the wall his sight was weak and his head foggy from all the pain as well as the drainage of power he felt sick to his stomach and his heart literally ached my lord cried a familiar voice as harry tried to focus his eyes across the room his breathing was rapid as he was able to make out a shadow of black race across his line of sight finally his sight improved and he watched as bellatrix knelt beside a fallen voldemort harry quickly turned his attention to bella former attentions instantly his heart tore once more as he took in the sight of the tortured and weak vision of hermione her head hung dangerously low her hair falling past her shoulders and touching the ground beneath her her arms were chained high upon the protruding stone and it was the only thing keeping her body up from falling horribly against the cold floor then slowly hermione lifted her head and her chocolate eyes caught sight of her husband harry gasped as he moved to make his way over to her he watched as hermione smiled softly trying to send him her support and belief before allowing her eyelids to gently slide close and her head dropped once more hanging low as she fell against the stone behind her hermione screamed harry silently as his eyes widened he quickly gripped his wand as he struggled to clamber to his feet he pressed his palm against the wall behind him as he fought to stand straight his head was thoroughly fogged up with pain and fear of his wife that he could barely think straight it was the survival instinct and all that mattered was to get to where hermione was he staggered forward ignoring the searing pain shooting from his arms back forehead etc he had made it no further than 4 steps forward before a loud burst was heard and a wave of angered power smacked harry directly in the face debris and stone flew in every which direction as a green light filled the room for a moment shocked harry snapped his head up and his eyes widened in horror once more as he watched as a livid voldemort hovered mere inches above the floor the green light of his aura sucked back toward him as he gently touched his toes back to the stone enough of this i am ending this now he screamed in seconds harry felt the cold spindly fingers of voldemort constrict around his neck as harry was flung once more against the hard surface that was the wall swallowing his cry of pain harry cracked open a livid eye as he stared into the dark blood red eyes of a monster he shot his gaze quickly in the direction of his wife to the left of voldemort left shoulder please be ok please xxx james crept quietly down the large and elaborate halls of slytherin castle gripping his wand tightly in his right hand as he carefully made his way through serenity and li were close behind him on his heels as they all were in search of the large hall in which harry was in mid battle li kept serenity close as they stealthily continued he would occasionally grip at her wrist almost to ensure that she was safely beside him before releasing and continuing through the castle a strong rumble was felt beneath them as the castle shook under an intense wave of power the dense power that hung in the air was just as thick as it was down on the auror camp fields if not more there was a low hum of surging power and serenity could feel as an aura of evil and an aura of good collided this way called james as he turned down a long elaborate stone carved corridor he led them away from the grand hallways of the slytherin castle and down the large corridor as his cloak swirled wildly behind him his face was set in determination and he looked ready to kill to protect his son the large corridor dead ended at a pair of massive stone carved doors that loomed eerily over the hall the closer the trio neared the heavy doors the stronger the tug of power became over serenity magic she could feel her magic as it was being beckoned pulled as they neared the doors as suspicious as she was she was certain that harry was behind those doors harry aura was unmistakable and the swirl of energy was undeniably harry although the closer they approached the harder it was for serenity to keep hold of her magic she was not used to such a strong force pulling at her and regardless of the hours she had trained to prevent this it still wasntenough the two battling powers were far too intense for serenity to handle then suddenly moments before they were at the doors serenity stopped pressing against the wall of the corridor for support as she tried to steady her dizzying head and her lack of breath li immediately ran to her side worry etched beautifully within his fine features serenity are you alright he asked softly as he stood beside her he placed a gently hand against her cheek as he lifted her face to meet his gaze immediately he knew and serenity could see the look of worry disappear as a look of ponderous thought washed over him serenity smiled li it alright i ok serenity said softly king james had stopped after realizing that the other two had as well and was making his way up to them quickly as he quietly checked for any other forms of life within the castle please li she said softly you re not used to the energy pull serenity nodded as she turned her eyes away she didntsee li softly smile at first but knew it was there he gently reached out for her hand and serenity eyes widened as she suddenly felt the familiar passage of energy coursing through her via her hand she looked up at li and caught his smile as she knew what he was doing he was transferring energy moments later serenity felt up to her full self once more as she pushed her back off of the wall leaning up she quickly placed a soft kiss upon li cheek thank you that really helped she said softly li did nothing but smile back as he stepped back no problem serenity smiled and turned to king james who was waiting beside them a few steps away he looked alert and serenity felt slightly ashamed at her sudden weakness she mustntslow the group down anymore come on she started softly they are close i can feel them with that she slipped softly passed li and up to the king james smiled and nodded as he turned back to make his way down the corridor xxx it was cold and damp within the small mouth of the cave that ginny had just entered light barely traveled in from the torched camp outside and what light did enter went on to cast eerily long shadows along the ragged walls she could hear footsteps ahead of her although they sounded distant she had no idea what she was doing here or why she was possessed with the notion that she had to know what was going on but here she was she prayed that sirius wouldntnotice her absence as well as ron as she tip toed after the two who had entered before her it was a lengthy walk but finally ginny found herself approaching a small room within the rocks a hollow pocket within the mountain ginny watched as she carefully stepped mindful not to allow her feet to splash too loudly as she walked by the heavy smell of setting water and minerals attacked her nose as she squinted trying to adjust her eyes to the unusual darkness finally as she reached the threshold of the hollow room like cave within the mountain a green light shown dimly in the distance and she could barely make out the outline of the two she had followed she watched as dumbledore extracted a long golden chain followed by a golden charm from the pouch at his side she had no idea what was going to happen or what she was doing here really but she knew she had to stay something was happening and she had to find out what xxx a dark figure crept quietly behind the red headed gryffindor as she entered the dark cave her curiosity and bold actions were intriguing but they were going to cost her she should have stayed back in the protection of the shield and other aurors if her life held any kind of value to her sneering the figure followed her deeper into the cave xxx sir sirius sir sirius panted a young auror bearing the symbol of ravenclaw at the sound of his name sirius quickly turned around and watched as the disheveled auror barreled through the protective shield entrance sirius quirked an eyebrow at the air of urgency in his attendance and watched as he approached breathless and shiny eyed yes what is the matter he asked the auror the auror allowed himself a few moments to catch his breath before turning his excitement up to the head auror sir the death eaters they ve been defeated he declared the light side has defeated the dark the death eaters have fled sirius could barely take in the information it was impossible the death eaters have been defeated that quickly the look of astonishment and slight disbelief didntseem to affect the ravenclaw auror as he stood straight before his head sir you are wanted out on the field the light side is victorious sirius took a moment to digest the information before allowing himself to release a sigh of relief a small smile made itself known upon the head auror features before turning to the others behind him the area within the shield had gone quiet and he was sure that the truth of the matter was just sinking into the others as well sirius turned and looked into the faces of all the injured aurors that lay before him he then turned to the awaiting aurors who were readying themselves for battle and finally turned to remus and ron the two of them had done so much in these last few hours and sirius knew he couldnthave accomplished half of what was accomplished had it not been for the two of them finally allowing a complete smile to be shown sirius turned to the ravenclaw auror and placed a kind hand upon his shoulder thank you son for this good news thank you very much the young auror smiled brightly apparently pleased with himself for a job well done he then watched as sirius gathered up his cloak and turned to exit the shield in excitement and suddenly the entire population within the shield emptied itself as they all excitedly followed sirius out onto the battle field as sirius finally entered the main field in which the majority of the battle had taken place the enormous weight of pressure finally lifted off his shoulders as he looked into the eyes of the other commanders king amos stood triumphantly before him his shiny golden armor gleaming in the light of the dying fires and the twinkling stars beside him was his son cedric with dirty tattered robes and an aura of pride about him they had done well beside the two royals of hufflepuff stood many of the commanders sent in by ravenclaw as well as the other aurors of gryffindor they all smiled and called over to sirius and the others as they poured into the large field many of the injured and dead had already been taken into the infirmary created within the shield but there were still a handful of aurors aiding wounded battle mates sirius my good fellow what astounding tactics came the boisterous voice of king amos simply amazing sirius smiled still stunned at the turn of events is it true have they been defeated he asked king amos smiled and placed a heavy hand atop sirius shoulder his smile was pathetic large and overly confident of course it is they went running off with their tails between their legs he boomed those cowards he trailed off by the looks of it sirius was having a hard time believing that hey just fled never in all his years as an auror did he know the dark side to flee it simply wasnthow they did things fighting to swallow the feeling of disbelief sirius allowed himself and his men to revel in victory he d question it later those cowards the whole lot of them king amos declared as he conjured up a glass of brandy he took a swig before patting his son heavily upon the back all cowards i say cowards are we amos came a voice from behind king amos almost choked down his brandy as he swirled around at the voice sirius jerked his head up as well as the others and everyone gasped as they took in who it was that had voiced their question sirius sneered lucius lucius smiled and nodded at sirius sirius lucius replied back he then turned to amos once more you d be wise to watch what you say amos you never know what your enemies might be listening in on amos visibly paled as he looked up on lucius what are you doing here lucius shouldntyou be saving your little magic tricks for your master sneered sirius lucius allowed his cold icy eyes to settle maliciously upon sirius as the coldest sneer washed over his face i believe the question that needs to be asked is what are you doing here no matter that is what i here to take care of he said men assemble suddenly an exceptionally large legion of men marched up behind the former king of slytherin sirius paled at the amount of reinforcements the dark side had hidden they didnthave half of the men that lucius now summoned what are we to do now xxx ok here it is i am sorry it is so short but i felt that

plunk was heard followed closely by a long distressed sigh on a large protruding rock at the edge of the lake sat the prince of gryffindor by the state of his extremely tousled hair and pained expression one could easily tell he was deeply troubled as he sat on the large rock he softly sent his last rock to go skidding across the black waters he loved this place whenever something troubled him deeply and he felt he needed to free his mind he would fly to the one place he could seek refuge on the banks of the black lake this lake was a well known lake for it shared its shore with the legendary hogwarts castle now a famous school of witchcraft and wizardry he looked across the lake at the glowing castle it was like a beam of light in a sea of darkness oh how he missed those years at hogwarts years of laughter and adventure years void of the burdens of royalty void of despair hermione yes he had heard of her in fact he had attended almost every class session with her as well during his time at hogwarts yet he had never gotten to know the top scoring student in all of hogwarts spending most of her time in the library similar to all of the ravenclaws harry had never actually spoken to the princess ever to tell the truth he hadnteven paid much attention to her what so ever he didnteven know what she really looked like apart from her bushy hair and timid personality ugh harry groaned as he shoved his hand deep within the pocket of his robes this isnt fair he thought as he extracted a small golden ball from it and held his palm open allowing it to rest in it small silver wings then unfolded from the little ball and it leapt into the air just above his palm whizzing around happily the snitch it had been a gift from his father when he was 15 and ever since traveled around in his pocket it was a great stress reliever as harry stared thoughtfully at the black lake the snitch flew gently around him before going for its escape within seconds harry had caught the speedy snitch in one fowl swoop without taking his eyes off of the giant squid that had surfaced from the lake this continued for a few minutes harry all the while thinking of what had happened earlier this morning how could they do this he muttered an arranged marriage he thought why he knew his father had always been adamant that the kingdom be strong and unified but arranging him in a false marriage to a princess he didnteven know what for the sake of expansion it was outrageous a cool breeze came whirling off of the lake rustling harry hair and the leaves about him the breeze felt good cool on his face and refreshing he continued to catch the snitch while thinking of ways of getting out of this nightmare hey there stranger came a silky voice from behind harry whirled around to come face to face with a dark beauty cho he said softly and lovingly cho smiled what are you doing here cho softly made her way over to the large rock harry had set himself upon well she drawled as she hoisted herself up onto the rock beside harry i had heard you d ran off after some unpleasant news and thought i d come and see what was wrong she finished harry looked at her for a moment before looking back to the lake you mean they sent you to find me right cho laughed slightly no she said your father has all of gryffindor out to find you pretty much what good would i be to them harry went to speak but cho stopped him when i heard you had ran off i was worried and i wanted to help she added sincerely how did you know where to find me i remember last night you telling me that hogwarts always felt like your sanctuary when things got rough so i figured this might be the place you went to a lucky guess nothing more she said as she looked at harry harry what wrong she had a sort of softness in her voice that made harry melt harry looked at her gently and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear do you really want to know lily will you please look at me james yelled frustrated within the castle lily had refused to talk to her husband and even look at him since the happenings of this morning she didntbelieve in this arrangement and appalled the way her husband took to breaking the news to her son lily why are you so upset this is for the better good of both kingdoms better good she snapped acknowledging james for the first time what good will this bring huh james our son will be miserable and so will poor hermione this is just another weak scheme of yours to strengthen your kingdom you haventput a single thought into what it may do to your son harry is a strong man he can do this lily lily shot james a look of pure fury yes you are right this will strengthen gryffindor but i have put into thought what this will do to harry and hermione the two of them are very strong willed but they will learn to love each other soon enough learn to love james how you are able to but those two in such situations and still sleep at night ceases to amaze me lily looked into james eyes with a sad expression as she placed a delicate hand on his chest why cantyou just let harry marry for love like we did james froze for a minute yes it was true that the two married for love a love that would last forever suddenly james expression changed from sentimental to one lily couldntunderstand because fate isntas kind as it was to us and with that james broke from lily touch and stormed out of the room leaving behind his confused angry and hurt wife the wind rustled harry hair as he finished up his grueling story the golden snitch long forgotten and back in harry pocket cho stared solemnly at the lake so she started you re to marry princess hermione harry nodded i see cho i was wondering maybe you could no harry i know what you re about to say but i can t cho interrupted but you and the princess are very close if you could only persuade her to harry she said calmly i cannot go against my kings wishes i sorry she said meekly she stood and made to leave but harry caught her hand cho cho slowly turned to look to him tears filling her slanted eyes he held her hand tight and pulled her into an emotional embrace cho wrapped her fingers tightly around the folds of his shirt as silent tears fell but as suddenly as the tears fell she pulled out of the tight embrace and stepped away from the prince i sorry harry she told him not bothering to wipe the tears i have to go and with a swish of robes cho was gone harry wanted to chase after her but thought against it not wanting to make matters worse he sighed deeply and picked up a flat rock he tossed it up and down a few times before as hard as he could chucked the rock with a heavy cry of frustration into the lake james stormed into his office area and slammed the door women he yelled in frustration he walked over to his desk and fell tiredly into his comfortable chair and ran his hand through his hair trouble with the misses eh said a voice from behind james quickly sat up and spun his chair around huh a shadowed figure slowly came off the wall it had been leaning against and walked into the light sirius sirius cringed you never call me sirius this is bad he joked james laughed so what are you doing here i thought you were still in hufflepuff till next week james asked yea well when i heard the news i hurried back james looked a little confused and what news is this james asked about harry and beautiful bride to be exclaimed sirius he walked over to james desk and sat in one of the chairs across the king and propped his boots up onto the desk so when were you lot planning on telling me that my godson was getting hitched how did you find out asked the king ahh well you see king amos and i had gone over to ravenclaw apparently the morning after you had left to speak over some negotiations when we arrived we were quite unpleasantly put face to face with a raging princess a fuming king and a weary queen heh quite a show i ll say sirius laughed a little but after seeing the tired face of his best mate and receiving no feedback decided to continue with his story well anyway after finally getting to the king that is after hermione had locked herself within her own room and placed countless advanced locking charms on it so complicated that the king couldntbreak through we were told of the betrothal and i ll tell ya mate the shock of hearing it from richard before you that hurt sorry mate i meant to tell you when you came back james told him eh no worries prongs sirius said so where is dear ol harry james sighed and shook his head dontknow padfoot he took off this morning after we told him the news rubbing his temples in hope that the migraine would pass james closed his eyes and tried to block all reality from his mind well i d say he took it rather well then sirius joked then he suggested did you try looking at the palace in godric hollow he tends to go there when he upset yes yes i ve tried everywhere i ve got men out looking for him now i dontknow what to do with him lily doesntunderstand and now she isnteven talking to me said james he was silent for a while before suddenly speaking he claims to be in love with the daughter of wu chang he hardly knows the girl he only met her yesterday morning quite rash if you ask me to know one for so little and claim endless love personally i enjoy rash thinking sirius yelled james ok ok laughed sirius as he put his hands up in defense how about remus tried gettin advise from him questioned sirius nah remus logic rivals that of lily s what i need is to talk to harry james said it was nearing evening so harry had decided to make his way home he carefully watched to make sure he wasntseen my any of the guards before swooping soundlessly into his opened bedroom window after dismounting the firebolt he had received from his godfather sirius he made to lean it against his cupboard knocking another broom down in the process he picked the broom up and admired its sleek silver handle and its slender form this isntmine he thought hi harry came a voice from within the darkness of his room harry quickly recognized the voice as he looked in the direction the voice came from into the moonlight came the raven beauty cho the moonlight illuminated her every feature from her figure to her lips to her tear filled eyes before he had a chance to ask what was wrong cho ran to him enveloping him tightly as she buried her face into his chest cho harry choked out what wrong cho wouldntanswer she had begun to cry deeply into his chest finally harry was able to sooth her and she began to calm down cho what happened well after i left you in the clearing i had returned home and received a letter from hermione she seemed desperate and requested that my return to ravenclaw be immediate cho stopped as she began to cry once more harry sat her down on his bed and sat beside her after she composed her self she continued i wrote her back telling her that i would return as soon as i could well i had began to prepare my things right away and set off to tell my father of the letter but when i told him he began to question me about my relationship with you he asked of my feelings for you and when i told him he demanded that i end our relationship immediately tears fell from her eyes but refused to cry again what harry yelled and stood he made to protest but cho stopped him harry there more she said painfully harry sat back down and allowed her to continue i came here to tell you in person of my return to ravenclaw i wanted to be the one to tell you but she didntwant to continue go on but what harry persisted dreading the worst but that is umm i wont be returning to gryffindor after this for years king amos of hufflepuff has been offering my father the position of high advisor seeing as they have been close friends for years and now my father has chosen to take the offer we will be leaving for the hufflepuff kingdom as soon as i see to hermione she finished what you cantbe serious cried harry this is because of the stupid marriage contract between hermione and me isntit because i care for you they are taking you away to rid themselves of the obstacle that stands in the way perhaps harry but you must understand i dontwant you to turn this into a big deal ok she told him what what do you mean he retorted they are taking you away from me because of this thing and you dontwant me to try and stop them why not because harry this is my king and my princess and i cannot go against them no matter what the reason i loyal to them harry and i sorry cho stood up and walked over to where her broom was propped she wiped the offending tears that were cascading down her cheeks but she new that this is what she had to do before she grabbed her broom she turned to harry harry please try to understand this is for my country that i do this but i want you to know that i will always love you harry looked at her and hurt filled his eyes he
