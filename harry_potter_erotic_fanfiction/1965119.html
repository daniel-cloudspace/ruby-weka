 a n am glad to be back had an excellent holiday but now i back home and at uni crap the updates may not be as regular as during the holidays but i promise that i am not abandoning the story at all even i want to see to the end of this and how it ends according to the hp website james was a chaser and not a seeker at all although he had the snitch to show off only i cantremember who asked me this but no lily and james have yet to kiss in this story something to look forward to a bit later i guess must also apologize because the holiday has wiped my mind clean and has given me stinky writer block james was sure that his heart would stop but it continued to hammer like a drum while he watched the grievers in their frenzy the seven sinister shapes hunched over lily with keen interest their hand like appendages roamed around barely inches away from touching her whilst they traced the contours of her body angered that they dared to go anywhere near lily and with a deep hatred and compulsion to get rid of them he strode in amongst their mass the effect was instantaneous his knees give way dropping him to the floor in front of her the feeling of despair was so acute that he found it hard to breathe at once the grievers inexplicably seemed to back off a little sensing that they could be seen for the first time fighting to control his breathing james closed his eyes letting the feeling roll right through him and when he opened them again he found that it was bearable it was mostly because the grievers had retreated to the darker corners of the room but all the same it was lessened and he found he could breathe again and the pressure in his chest lessened lily slept on unaware of the struggles of james wakeful world and he sat in front of her wishing he could join her in her dreams unable to do little more he glared at each of the grievers daring them to return at risk but none of them did and with time he would return his attention back to lily feeling a kind of peace he had so desperately sought in the past week still the grievers were always on the edge of his thought threatening to dominate and for the first time in his life he felt a deep fear the grievers were there for a reason lily let out a small moan in her sleep and shifted james reached out and brushed away the hair that had fallen over her face but she awoke at his touch and sat up jamie she exclaimed happily are you all right i fine he lifted the corners of his mouth in what would have been a smile like hell you are you got hit by a bludger it fine he repeated and subjected himself to her inspection of his newly healed ribs dontyou ever scare me like that she snapped at him but then threw her arms around his neck and pulled him closer i sorry he hugged her back tightly all the while looking over her shoulder at the nearest grievers it getting late shouldntyou be going up to bed he said gently lily nodded and let go reluctantly james seemed peculiar i suppose she stood up i guess i ll see you tomorrow then she turned to leave and the grievers stirred james saw them slink out of the shadows one by one to follow her his heart was racing again at the thought of them following lily all the way to bed lily she stopped with one foot on the stairs unaware that the grievers were swarming around her what will you stay the night with me here james stuttered frantically searching for a reason for her to stay he did not want her to know about the grievers to be honest i wouldntmind having some company i guess i ve been a little off this week he trailed off and then felt some color rise in his face it not to you know not to but i uh just wanted some company he waited with a baited breath and to his relief lily nodded all right if possible the grievers appeared to be pissed off as lily made her way back and took his outstretched hand once again they retreated back to the corners watching they settled back onto the sofa with james leaning against the arm and lily resting against his chest she snuggled closer and james wrapped his arms around her if the grievers wouldntgo near her while he was around then he vowed that he would never leave her side you can sleep if you want i dontmind he said and she nodded already feeling her eyes close in his warmth within minutes her breathing grew regular and deeper leaving james alone to ponder why the grievers had taken an aversion to him again he looked over to the moving darkness but saw that they had not left the corners releasing a shaky breath he rested his chin on top of lily head he thought he wouldntsleep but the rhythm of lily slow breathing was infectious and soon he was drifting off into a darkness of his own one filled with grievers and all of them surrounding lily with a jolt james jerked awake bewildered he found himself alone with the pale morning light filtering gently into the room the grievers were nowhere to be seen and lily was also missing alarmed he got up and was about to start yelling her name when he realized that she d probably woken early and had returned to her room to get changed for the day james raced up the stairs and into his own room he had a very good idea where the grievers were or rather where they d followed lily with record breaking time james hopped into the shower even before the water had warmed up and gave himself a quick shave before stumbling back into the room while trying to dress the marauder map lay open on his bed and he pinpointed the lily spot to still be in her room why are you up so early remus was sitting up rubbing his eyes he was so accustomed to being the first up every morning that it came as something of a shock when he woke to see james up and awake sirius moaned you have got to learn to shut up in the mornings he stretched out an arm to pull his alarm clock over and he groaned again i going to kill you two it not even seven james looped a tie over his neck hastily trying to tie it while watching the dot obsessively as it moved around the room on the map in his haste he d knotted it instead but he left it and worked on his shirt buttons prongs slow down remus thought his friend might unwittingly strangle himself with his own tie i can t lily might come out of her room any second he said while buttoning until he found that he was one button short on the left side telling him that he d missed one at the top and that a bad thing remus asked confused at why his friend sounded so concerned at lily leaving her room james explained what he d seen as rapidly as he could pulling on socks as he did something is going to happen to lily at best it will be unpleasant but at worst it ll be tragic he finished there were seven of them ben had one and his broom had gone berserk and ended up crash landed and these grievers seem to be scared of you sirius had been listening propped up on his elbows i wouldntsay scared but they dontlike me and whenever i close they dontgo near lily that why as soon as i can i going to make sure that i there they re not the cause remus began yes yes i know but all the same i dontlike them being around her you cantbe around her all the time mate she ll think you re off your rocket sirius said unless you tell her james wanted to laugh and it took him a second to realize that he was laughing a kind of maniacal laughter that he had no idea he was capable of what do i say sorry lily but you ve got grievers around you and that means you re going to suffer neither sirius nor remus said anything but they exchanged a glance with each other i am not going to let anything happen to lily there was nothing but absolute determination and no one would doubt that he meant otherwise something twittered high on the rung that remus bed curtains hung from and james gasped expecting it to be another griever is that a bat he asked after he got a good look at it remus looked up and confirmed that james was not seeing things sure is prongs meet chewy the bat chewy sirius made a face at the upside down bat moony latest acquirement you remember that lesson where we had to transform a bottle into any animal we wanted well moony turned his into a bat my honest opinion is that moony was better off with an empty bottle of butterbeer damn thing does nothing but squeak when it wants to go out and squeak when it wants to come in squeak when it wants to eat squeaks when it wants to shit i bet it bloody squeaks when it even got an itch but you called it chewy remus laughed well chewy has this thing about padfoot laces yeah the bloody thing thinks they re some kind of delicacy sirius snorted with distaste chews them like crazy i ve already had to fix them five times what is it with you and animals they all hate you sirius shrugged at james beats me the lily dot was making a move on the map right i ll see you guys later james said and swiftly left the room remus and sirius stared after him that not healthy sirius commented on james plan he had never seen him so driven before what else can he do suppose i wonder why they dontlike him remus wondered aloud if i were some unseen shadow drawn to misery i wouldntbe too comforted if someone could suddenly see me i d feel exposed good point prongs didntactively try to stop them from their activity until they started to haunt lily right sirius nodded they chose the wrong girl to haunt he meant it no one knew james better than him and he knew his best friend would never let anything happen to someone he loved lily didntknow whether she was more surprised to find james waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs or the state that he was in he looked like he d just stepped out of a shower and had thrown his clothes on with no regard his hair was still dripping and his white shirt was soaked through and his tie hung in knots around his neck and the buttons were done wrong he looked wet and cold and somehow nervous he kept looking around her but nevertheless he greeted her warmly and kissed her on the forehead what happened to you you look like a drowned duck she exclaimed james rubbed his wet hair i was trying to get a date with the giant squid but i think she wasnttoo interested he said lightly while watching the grievers shy back lily chuckled and grabbed hold of his tie and pulled him closer i bet you re disappointed she said and began to loosen the knots once undone she worked on correcting his buttoning but james stopped her by holding her hands not at all a moment passed and lily thought his expression to be most peculiar until he drew closer and lowered his face to lily upturned one with a gulp she thought he was about to kiss her but he did little more than touch his nose to hers she could smell the toothpaste on his breath as he continued to run the tip of his nose down the bridge of hers it was a very little gesture but nonetheless the effect it had on lily was profound she would have moved in and initiated a kiss herself had a drop of water not decided to fall from his wet hair and drip straight into her eye blinded in her left eye she pulled away and blinked it away while regretting the loss of his closeness james was surprised at himself where had that come from he d always been fascinated by the way lily scrunched her nose up whenever the particular expression was adequate all he had wanted to do was smooth it over and little was he expecting one of those moments to pop up romance should be far off his mind with the grievers about although he could not deny that in that instant it was very much clouding his mind and demanding attention clearing her throat lily finished buttoning up his shirt and left him to tuck it in while she finished his tie you re still wet but you ll do she said and winced thinking that she sounded a lot like her mother thanks james bent over to pick up his cloak that lay rumpled on the floor with no idea when he d dropped it he sneezed excuse me he sniffed that what walking around wet does to you she told him and they headed out of the portrait hand in hand jamie she said after a while hmm is something wrong you dontseem right today lily actually thought that that was a bit of an understatement but if she d learned anything about james it was that she d never be able to get anything out of by force instead to be effective she needed to use more persuasive ways she inwardly snorted at herself she d never thought that she would resort to manipulative wiles to get what she wanted besides it was put in for a good cause he been very distant as of late and now suddenly he seemed to not want to let her go and his display wasntexactly what you d call normal something had to be wrong i fine honest lily wanted to roll her eyes as much as he was trying to be convincing the way he kept casting wary looks about gave it all away no one who was just fine ever looked like that you ve even cut yourself shaving coming to think of there was a stinging sensation just below his jaw line he wiped at it with the back of his hand carelessly it nothing important lily frown deepened but he refused to say anymore if you say so james could sense her mood changing and her manner grew brisk it wasntthat he didntwant to tell her he just couldn t mr potter mcgonagall called from behind them morning professor they automatically chimed as she approached she nodded morning a word please mr potter lily pulled her hand out of his i ll see you in the hall she began to back off what wait he protested and pulled her back professor cantwe talk later he asked desperate not to let lily walk off alone mcgonagall eyebrows arched its about quidditch and the cup then it okay that we talk about it later the professor was now openly surprised normally the mention of the word quidditch was enough to make the boy glue himself to a chair in order to listen it will only be a few words i assure you she said then lily can stay as well he said it was hard to tell whether lily was more shocked or mcgonagall what is wrong with you potter lily pulled herself out of his grasp again i ll see you later she said firmly and walked off what was with this sudden clinginess james watched her leave helplessly stuck in this living nightmare where shadows moved at will there was little that he could do as the darkness slinked after lily mcgonagall cleared her throat making james drag his attention back to her he was suddenly restless eager for her to say what she had to say so he could leave lily continued to make her way to the hall somewhat puzzled by james new behavior he was still undeniably sweet but there was something in his eyes the way they constantly shifted around as if he were searching for something he looked haunted she shuddered involuntarily but thought nothing more of it she reached the landing pausing when she heard a weird scraping sound looking up she could just make out the misty outline of peeves pushing with all his might at a rusted suit of armor through a broken banister the floor above he was not paying any attention or thought to the fact that he could be pushing it straight on top of someone head below no doubt he just wanted to make some noise and a mess peeves she shouted but he couldnthear her with a resigned sigh lily knew she wouldntbe able to run up and stop him before he completed his deed returning her attention to her own floor her heart almost stopped because crouched over his shoe was brent one look back up told her that the armor was toppling over the side brent she shouted and made a dive a n okies a minor spoiler i just couldntallow you guys to think that having seven grievers has only amounted to a set of armor falling on lily well of course it not enough no something very bad will happen apologies for producing only a so so chapter i feeling a bit rusty and the writer block doesnthelp a n work load is huge but it weekend and i felt the need to write i ll try to keep my updates at least once per week i hope you guys enjoy this chapter james now understood why impatience was always depicted as a person tapping his or her foot he imagined that his leg was tapping so fast that he creating a constant hum of his shoe on the stone in reality he was just fidgeting restlessly the house cup no longer stands of having our name on it this year dontdisappoint me by giving the quidditch cup away too mcgonagall was saying james heard about two words out of her speech quidditch and away it was the latter that he wanted the most mr potter at least pretend that you ve heard what i ve said like you usually do the professor snapped but sighed when her student just blinked blankly at her still it was nothing new student love was always the same but james potter and lily evans did have a special ring around them it reminded of her own school days minerva pulled on breaks on at that fine potter you may go he d apparently heard that part with absolutely no problem because he was half turned in the direction lily had left in and would have sprinted down the corridor had a heavy crash not caused them both to jump lily her name and face flashed in red danger lights all around james head and he was tearing down the corridor in his eyes he could see all the grievers surrounding her and somehow lily was horribly aware of what they represented when he arrived his heart was pounding not so much from the run as from the dread of seeing lily the first thing he saw was the pieces of disjointed armor that lay scattered about the carpet next he saw lily sit back away from brent rubbing her knees with a frown for a split second his mind did not register what it was that felt so completely wrong with what he was seeing he blinked twice more before closing his eyes completely the grievers they re gone it was like an answered prayer but no prayer could ever feel this suspicious or fragile he relaxed his eyelids and opened again there they were the excited grievers were gathered at such a density that lily looked almost obscured in their smothering blanket one more blink and they were gone blink there they were again blink gone it was as if they were playing some sort of morbid now you see me now you don t trick with his eyes one final decisive blink and they did not reappear confused james took a step closer to lily cautiously he blinked a few good times to check that they werentpulling a sly one and werentwaiting to spring a surprise on him but finally satisfied that he could see no suspicious shadow lurking or feel any change in the gravity around him he felt a genuine grin spread on his face maybe just maybe this was it the grief was over and lily came out relatively unscathed well at least she looked unscathed he gave her a once over scan and decided that she was okay although he was more worried about her expression she had her right brow arched and she looked back at him as if he d just done a monkey dance are you feeling all right she asked him as if expecting him to repeat the monkey dance he had just performed it was then that james realized that he had spent a good few minutes blinking in an exaggerating and excessive manner brent was also looking at him as if he too thought he was mad turning around confirmed that mcgonagall had a similar expression etched on her face clearing his throat james raked a hand through his damp hair and grinned never been better he went over to her and held out a hand are you hurt he asked as much out of concern as wanting to draw attention away from himself what happened lily took his offer and stood up brushing her skirt maybe a bruise on my shin peeves happened he pushed the armor off the balcony above and brent was right below it oh it didnttake a genius to work out that lily had pushed him out of the path of a certain crash just in time yes about that i did see it coming but i was just a touch preoccupied might have taken me just a second more to get out of the way myself but anyway thank you for saving me brent said quickly also getting up he picked up his bag and waved cheerio then he makes it sound like we should award him a medal or something james huffed oh shush you know what he like lily said with a smile while having a rummage in her bag i need to go back to my room i forgot my ink we can use mine he protested the grievers were nowhere to be seen but that didnterase his sense of dread yeah but my one changes color as you write does your ink do that she teased james appeared thoughtful well at the moment it writes only in black but i sure i can figure out a spell that will fix it that a lot of effort it ll be easier for me to get mine where are you going she added when james made a move to follow her going with you lily grimaced you know i think it very sweet how you re always waiting around with me and going everywhere with me she paused briefly trying to pick her words carefully but urm dontyou think that it will ruin your guy image or something what she had really intended to say was that she found it a bit overwhelming and at times smothering james looked puzzled for a split second but it soon was clear he had literally been tailing her for the past day as much as he loved her company if situation had been reversed he would have been feeling quite claustrophobic over the obsessive attention he chuckled what so what you really mean is that i ruining your girl image it not cool to have you boyfriend with you all the time well yeah lily laughed well go ahead to the hall and i ll be there in five minutes if not send out a search team for me will do he promised with the intention of leading the search team if need be take my bag down to the hall with you please she handed it to him and almost skipped away feeling like nothing in the world could go wrong james watched her leave reluctantly as much as the feeling of safety from the grievers had returned he could not help but feel paranoid he checked his watched and headed for the hall neither he nor lily noticed that mcgonagall had slipped away beckoned by someone with something grave to tell once seated james found the morning paper already on the table and he turned straight to the back in the property sales section a minute or two later sirius dropped into a seat opposite him muttering under his breath he was hunched over and he had his cloak pulled up around his ears bloody cold he poured himself a cup of tea is that a bit of egg on my plate or has your flying chicken been in today he complained tatty has been here but she didntdo anything because you werentaround james replied without taking his eyes off the paper is it me or is that cat getting fat james flicked a glance at nutmeg whom he hadntnoticed arrive at the table he reached over and poured a saucer of warm milk maybe she did seem a bit chubby but she was still very cute you re over feeding that ball of fluff sirius commented bright ray of sunshine you are today james said with humor well if i hadntbeen woken up so damn early couldntget back to sleep i think i starting to feel ill anyway go see pomfrey she got this great ginger tea that will zap you right out of any cold it ll make you smoke out of your ears for a bit but other than that it good maybe later sirius sniffed what are you looking at flats and houses what for i cantlive with my parents forever i thought that with graduation so near it was about time i started looking for a place of my own i thought you were coming to live with me sirius said with some surprise i made sure the place i got was big enough for all four of us i not so sure lily is going to like living with four guys sirius usual grin slipped into place oh so this is what it all about looking for a love nest are we had enough of the broom closet james flicked the crust of his toast at him unlike you i have standards as well as a perfect understanding of basic hygiene pah who needs to buy a whole house for a bit of nookie no seriously i really do have a room ready for you if you want to move out good i ll be there whenever i cantbe bothered to go home james pointed at a random advertised flat okay if you want after a moment he spoke again you seem awfully happy considering the state you were in this morning james filled sirius in on the falling armor you really think that it sirius asked when he had finished once again james felt as if his fragile hope was balancing on the tip of a sword but he shrugged i like to think that it or i d still be able to see them right yeah or the spell could have worn off sirius said with unsettling reason could be james said tightly aware that he d left lily return to her room by herself noticing the effect this had on his friend sirius decided that the mood needed to be lightened he peered over at the paper how about that one he asked pointing at a picture of a bungalow i dontthink lily will like that one this one no she ll hate that sirius eyebrows went up and he began to randomize each colourful picture but all of james comments always involved lily in one way or another you re making out that you two are moving in together once you graduate he said finally what of course not james exclaimed in surprise but then he thought about it it did seem a lot like that he hadntintentionally thought about it but it just seemed that whenever he thought about the what next in his future she automatically became part of it you guys haventbeen together that long that a lot of commitment sirius said voicing james concern now that sirius had said it james felt a little shaky what was he doing in one movement he had the newspaper closed whoa that was scary sirius nodded solemnly i almost lost you there mate james shook his head and straightened the paper this time focusing on the headlines you know who has killed again he said gravely as he skimmed the article another death list he scanned the list to see if there were any names he recognized his eyes reached the end of the list before something he d seen made him do a double take oh shit a n what do you think happens next a n dear all apologies for such a late update but things at uni have grown hectic this chapter does a lot of time skipping so please bear with it but it just that a lot needed to happen i think one or two significant snippets of information come out in this one but because it taken me so long to write it i ve forgotten most of them hello professor lily greeted happily as she skipped down the last few steps from the dormitories her eyes flicked over to the tall figure to mcgonagall side and immediately noted a difference in dumbledore usual amiable features morning sir she added with somewhat caution there was something wrong professor dumbledore never looked like that his mouth was pressed into a thin line and his eyes were far from twinkling but ice cold moreover in all her years at hogwarts she had never seen the headmaster step foot into the gryffindor common room good morning miss evans he replied his voice giving nothing away but all the same lily grew more uncomfortable if you would care to join me at my office please this way dear mcgonagall guided her out with a hand on her back lily was now very confused never had mcgonagall projected such a a softened image of herself she cared a great deal for her students of course but never had she so openly shown so in this confused state lily followed the headmaster and professor down the corridor with little idea that in just a moments time no path she would ever step foot on would not be influenced by what they had to tell from a far enough distance to escape detection a certain shadow lurked it was not an insubstantial griever but a person of flesh and blood the malcontent of this particular shadow was not to be taken lightly it rivaled that of a griever bound from spite and spun out of malice with a will beyond its control it could do no more than serve its master and become the lowest of all creatures a spy lily was no longer aware of herself the office had somehow blurred and she thought everything had grayed until a tiny voice in her conscious mind told her to wait before slipping into darkness all together i i need to see petunia i want to see my sister she managed firmly once she had proper grasp of her words she did not hear anything else that was said to her but at last mcgonagall stood up and she followed her wordlessly aware that they were leaving hogwarts and taking the well worn path down to hogsmeade once inside the village she followed the professor into the hog head until they stood in front of a roaring green fire mcgonagall placed a comforting hand on her shoulder there will be an official waiting for you on the other side st thomas is the place there was little more that she could say and she stepped back letting lily have the space to jump st thomas lily croaked and stepped into the fire the sensation was quite unlike any that she had ever felt in her previous floo journeys she was falling more than twirling and in a flash she landed on her feet in a cluttered janitor room lily gulped she still felt like she was falling but a strong and bony hand reached out and gripped her about the elbow this way miss evans the kindly looking wizard said and led her out of the closet into a busy hospital corridor at once the noise burst onto her and she took a few seconds to adjust muggles were everywhere but they paid no attention to her or her strange school uniform although she could see a fair number of wizards undoubtedly sent from the ministry of magic to work on muggle memories loitering about to the far right lily spotted her sister who was hunched over on her knees on a seat a large man sat next to her seemingly comforting her seeing her sister brought a hard lump to her throat and she almost went running to her before she remembered one of the rules that petunia had made for her lily stopped suddenly lost in a memory muuuuuum petunia wailed honey you have to learn to accept what your sister is at the end of the day she will always be your little sister and there is nothing you can do to change that diane said leaving no room for argument fine the then teenaged petunia huffed and dragged her eleven year old sister up by the hand she still held her hand back then lily remembered fondly pulling her up the stairs petunia led her to her room and dumped her in front of her desk and shoved a pen and paper in her hand if i cantchange your freaky ways then we are going to have to make up a lot of rules to control it she announced now listen carefully i want you to write all of this down number one never mention this to anyone if neighbors ask just tell them you are at a boarding school far far away the then lily obediently picked up the pen and began to write down the dictation one by one she continued to write rule number thirty when i with my friends under no circumstance are you to show your face if you have to i dontwant you to speak at all and so forth until at the very end she said now sign it lily printed her name as neatly as she could before the papers were snatched away petunia had them pinned up on her notice board for the first year or so before her dislike for magic grew to such epic proportions that lily came home one holiday to find them ripped off over time lily forgot many of those rules and sometimes broke them just to annoy her sister but now for some strange reason rule number thirty came back straying aside she patiently waited becoming quite unawares of her surrounding until at last the man she now recognized as vernon moved away petunia petunia head snapped up at the voice of her sister lily flinched back at the angry red eyed stare her sister shot at her how dare how dare you come here she hissed as low as she could control lily could feel her face crumple and her voice came out like a lost child s i wanted to see mum and dad petunia was crying openly now but none of the tears could stop the rage she felt deep inside i will not let you harm them anymore never will you go near them ever again lily thought that petunia might have hit her but her sister muscles had locked and all she could do was clench her fists it you you all you re fault she sobbed i i lily could find nothing to say petunia head snapped up and this time she did strike out lily reeled back and raised a hand to her stinging cheek you what what can you say you ve killed you own mother and father you filthy little witch lily staggered back it was real everything that dumbledore had said to her in his office came flooding back with a frightening reality punch she wouldntbelieve it she hadntbelieved it she had even blocked it out until petunia had made it real the forgotten official was suddenly there pulling her away he d silently witnessed the whole scene and would later report back to dumbledore with great sympathy away he led her until they were outside and into the cold winds by the river thames outside lily slumped onto the barrier slipping somewhere between shock and back into denial her breaths came out raggedly and she seemed like she might pass out with a last surge of effort she pulled her wand from her pocket and threw it over head with as much might as she could the sleek wand soared out spinning as it flew in a wide arc before it finally splashed into the calm murky gray water lily watched as it slowly sank lower and lower into the darkness below james dropped the paper onto the table and raked a hand through his damp hair and fell into a stunned silence across from him sirius was frowning and he reached over to pick up the paper he scanned it is this evans the evans he asked with some dreaded caution james could only nod diane and harry are were james found it hard to gather his thoughts it seemed like just yesterday he was complimenting diane cooking and laughing with harry and now now they had become a statistic james picked up the paper again feeling a deep loathing for the printed sheets and hated it even more for it content shit sirius echoed his initial reaction james scrunched the newspaper up into a ball and threw it at the table this should not have happened trying to recompose his command on rational thoughts he shouldntbe angry at a piece of paper reporting tragedy he should be angry at the source voldemort he said with poison peter and remus choose that exact second to reach the table and peter squeaked and covered his ears that was unnecessarily loud remus said pointedly as he sat down you shouldntsay his name out loud like that peter warned while casting paranoid glances around he might hear you and then you ll be in trouble he stopped when he saw the dark stare james had on him voldemort is killing he said to peter are we supposed to just sit here while he chooses and picks who next he wants wiped out convinced that he had a point peter uncharacteristically argued back for which he was very proud of himself but we re students we cantdo anything against a wizard like him james leaned forward his eyes darkened we wontbe students for much longer and then what would we do without hogwarts for protection peter gulped he was no longer so sure that he had a point the more we fear him the more control he has i for one am not going to just here like a duck and let him rule us like toys quite right mr potter dumbledore said surprising everyone from behind his eyes bright i agree no one indeed is immune to these dark times his voice softened and reached out and patted james on the shoulder however there are those that arentsitting around like ducks as you say he trailed off seemingly like he wasntgoing to say more but after a pause he did we re not looking for heroes but for those that stand for what is important to them with that he swept away to his seat at the front that was enigmatic sirius thought aloud i ve never seen him look so serious except when the death list came out last time remus reminded james felt more confused than the others and could not help but keep replaying the headmaster words in his mind something in it did not strike him as simply one of the many eccentricities that the old man harbored who the we he asked what the we when he said we re not looking for heroes remus shrugged i thought he meant the school as in the school isntlooking for heroes so dontdo something stupid james kind of meaning he said with a faithful guess that james would try to do something stupid right james fell quiet still not quite convinced was there a third party that dumbledore was referring to as a we something that was set up to fight against voldemort specifically he hadntheard about it and it appeared that no one else in the wizarding community seemed to know about it oh remus exclaimed loudly interrupting james thoughts he d picked up the newspaper he gave james a sympathetic look is she okay james was on his feet in a flash how could he have not thought about it he had been so consumed with his own reaction that he had not even considered those of lily her parents he groaned inwardly at his callousness and made a run back to the tower a n many thanks for all reviews they do help me write the next big thing that happens will probably take place away from hogwarts gasp no they haventgraduated yet but i felt rather inspired by london while i was strolling along the thames today to ember marie i really appreciate you honest reviews and dontthink they are harsh at all i hope that i will show considerable improvement with the upcoming chapters xxx james arrived back at the common room and found himself in front of a sight that had proven to be a nuisance far too many times already the stairs lily he shouted up the stairs lily he shouted louder aware that he was probably waking up a lot of late sleepers he ducked as a small cauldron was thrown down the stairs at him you have got to find a different way of getting your girlfriend attention potter the owner of the cauldron shouted sorry hey could you just get lily down for me please sod off potter i guess not then james sighed already moving back to make room for a run up with a few stretches to limber up he started to run oh no you dontpotter james screeched to a stop surprised at being shouted at from someone behind what is it with people nowadays is it the new thing to call me by my surname whatever happened to james he demanded as he turned to see who it was it was bad enough having lily calling him potter at least she only did it when she was angry with him professor he said quite taken aback by seeing mcgonagall uh hi he added sheepishly at having snapped at her without meaning to step one foot on those steps and you will finish off the rest of your last year in detention she warned her voice low and threatening james quickly straightened himself up and pasted an incredulous look on his face me up those stairs nah uh i was just running morning jog keeps the heart healthy the lie he gave didntmatter because it had been obvious what he was trying to do but nonetheless giving an answer was better than no answer i suspect you were looking for lily james felt inclined to offer a sarcastic answer but decided now was not the best of times yes i was he admitted you wontfind her in her room the professor said her voice changing ever so slightly the corners of her pale face pinching i need to find her the morning paper there something she needs to know james explained feeling his hot antagonistic inclination dissipate and the sadness seep back she nodded i know the headmaster and i we ve informed her of the tragedy i see she not in the castle at the moment she requested to see her sister i expect her to return back to the school in a few hours mcgonagall turned to go but she paused at the door these are dark times james and there no doubt that they will get darker yet she said without turning and then swiftly left james stood alone in the common room left with nothing but her echo of dumbledore ominous words they ricocheted in his mind throwing themselves from wall to wall until they stabbed deep into a niche already he knew it was beginning its growth a festering malignant tumor that he would carry for the rest of his life darker yet the officer respectfully left lily to grieve by herself although he never took his eyes off her for a few seconds in all his twenty years of working for the ministry he had seen more times than he could count the damage of losing a loved one could do to a person all forms of rational thought becomes something of a memory and life itself becomes all but the faintest smudge that would float away with one careless breath seven metres of space he stood away from her she had seven metres to grieve in and he had seven metres to cover before he would reach if she were to do something he had to prevent in most circumstance it was seven metres too much and all the while he was constantly aware that any second that she could decide that she had had enough she could throw herself over the bridge and plunge into the icy water below this lily evans however showed no inclination to do such a thing she sat at the base of railing leaning her back against it she had fallen to that position after disposing of her wand and hadntmoved since life didntstop to see her fallen on the concrete floor of the bridge busy londoners continued to stride past oblivious to her presence locked in her seven metres worth of space lily too ignored them and the busy traffic lost in her own solitude the officer knew the routine well first came the shock then came the denial then the hysterics grief came in many forms but it usually preferred to manifest itself in that general order he waited expecting the girl to start crying at any minute but an hour slipped by followed by a second and it was fast approaching the third and still there was no sign of the last stage of grief rubbing his stiff joints he ambled up to the girl and he laid a hand on her unresponsive shoulder dumbledore will be expecting you back safely at the school soon he said she nodded vaguely okay just give me a minute i need to clean up at the ladies she said her control over speech was perfect although her expression remained strangely neutral sure he answered although he was very unsure at her reaction there are some public toilets just at beyond the stairs she nodded politely and stood up giving her robe two exacting swipes to smooth down the creases i ll be right back she promised although she had no intention of keeping it with no reason to prevent her from leaving his sight the officer stepped aside lily walked slowly off the bridge however she did not go straight ahead to where he had pointed but she ducked down the stairs her measured steps gave way to a quick patter of her heels as she took the stairs two at a time and jumped off the last three alongside the meandering river she ran past the london aquarium and the famous theaters she ran until she thought her lungs might collapse and her vision blurred chest heaving she doubled over by a heavily graffiti covered wall unsure whether the physical or emotional pain hurt more the area was infamously known to be populated with young teens testing out their skills on skateboards but today it was thankfully empty knowing that the officer would be searching for her soon she spurred her legs to work and she entered a narrow alley that stank of urine and was further decorated more by swollen letters sprayed painted from cans still not matter how unpleasant her unfamiliar surrounding was it was a much better refuge than the large comfort of the huge castle that had been the core of her freakishness for so many years now at that moment she would gladly chop years off her life in exchange for her not to return to it and be a witch with that thought she ventured deeper into the dingy alley that seemed dark even though it had yet to be noon she heard voices coming from an offshoot ahead and contemplated choosing another alley to hide in before she heard something that made her freeze the dark lord will be very pleased well done tether came a voice i will do whatever the lord asks of me a monotone voice answered lily recognized neither voice but she did recognize two names first and foremost she recognized dark lord with a gut wrenching reminder secondly the name tether was highly familiar tether tether tether tether david tether david tether was a young man who graduated from hogwarts the year lily arrived for her first year he was a top student and had won many prizes some of which were still displayed in the trophy room after his graduation he had joined the ministry of magic and had quickly been promoted to head of public relations and personnel department one peak around the corner confirmed that her suspicions had been correct he had changed little since she had last seen him same mousy brown hair and slanted eyes on a lanky body her heart began to pick up speed again what was he doing here her internal sirens were going off but she felt compelled to ease closer and listen do you wish to be part of the raid the lord has yet to choose when but i expect it will be very soon the first voice cackled that old fool thinks his antique school is impenetrable hogwarts is nothing but a stepping stone for our lord i ll tell you that i cannot be part of the raid tether said it would look too suspicious my roles lies within the ministry who there lily jumped she was certain she had not made any noises a split second later she realized that she was not the only one spying on the plotting twosome but another was nearby and it was he who had made the noise it was too late she had taken a step back and had kicked back an empty can the rust tin clattered loudly across the narrow alley panicked lily backed off and was running feet pounded behind her and she picked up speed until suddenly something a spell hit her from behind and she pitched forward into the deep dark of unconsciousness as the day wore on anxiousness drove james bad mood into the depths of the worst black clouds a lot of hours had passed and lily still hadntreturned he went through each lesson paying little attention and by early evening he was at mcgonagall office door knocking apprehensively come in james entered the orderly office professor lily still hasntreturned yet no james she hasn t he stood in front of her desk waiting expectantly for an explanation but she just stared back at him is she okay he asked feeling that his question was rhetorical she held is gaze for a few seconds longer i dontknow james i sorry her truthful answer surprised james uncertainty was not something head of gryffindor showed often she ran away from the assigned officer the headmaster has arranged for a search we can only wait she said with emphasis on wait stunned james left her office a few minutes later he went straight to the common room where he knew sirius remus and peter were waiting for him any news remus asked hopefully james shook his head she ran away she what sirius choked on his sweet remus slapped him on the back a few times until his coughing subsided not good a n i not quite happy with this chapter but i do like the next one that i working on to taiyourshoes wow thank you soooo much i mean really when i read your review the writer in me went voom and i was so happy much appreciated xxx james lay still in his bed until sirus was snoring softly and he could hear the even breathing of the others exercising all his skills of stealth he d developed over the years of sneaking about after dark he slid out of his bed fully dressed not even the floorboards creaked underfoot as he tiptoed out of the room with his broom and invisibility cloak he carefully avoided the certain click of the door closing by leaving the door ajar he also made sure that the gap was small enough so that no light from the corridor could shine through the rest the trek though nighttime hogwarts was easier his feet knew the floors well and he avoided any squeaky boards or walking in any direct light bright enough to cast a definite shadow almost automatically james had reached the second floor on the east wing when a voice surprised him the kitchen is the other way i not going to the kitchen moony james said recognizing the voice even before he turned around to see him standing behind him with crossed arms i know you re not he sighed clearly kinowing very well what his friend was up to james didntreply i thought you werentgoing to do anything stupid james because in case you haventnoticed this is almighty stupid james could see that remus was being deadly serious it had been ages since he d called james by his name with deliberate actions he decisively threw the invisibility cloak around himself and fastened it about his neck now all remus could see was his best friend head bobbing up and down as he walked away broom partially hidden in his hand james he snapped as he followed the bobbing head to the owlery i ve made my mind up moony i going to get her you donteven know where she is how do you expect to find her in london in fact how the hell do you think you re going to get there james whistled and tattlaevore swooped down silently and landed on his exposed arm good girl he stroked her soft head twice do you think you re going to fly to london it going to be one heck of a long flight and i suspect you ll have quite an audience as you go no james replied with a sickening calmness to his voice i ll travel by floo from hogsmeade and then tatty will show me the way nobody will see me because i ll be wearing my cloak it too dark for anyone to discern a bunch of twigs flying in the air remus stared at the owl and then at james are you insane no my mind is in perfect health tatty will know where she is owls always find the recipient for letters it might not be her you know i know okay so what if it isnther i ll try to get that girl out and then find lily remus rolled his eyes although he knew perfectly well that james would keep his word but he was persistent and was determined to dissuade james from doing something he thought was insanely stupid it was the equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack have you ever thought that she ran away because she doesntwant to come back here even if it was her in the ally she might not even want to come back after you save her the tension in the room heightened and james tensed she wants to come back he said firmly she a witch she belongs here remus threw his hands in the air with exasperation you dontget it do you for a moment uncertainty flickered across james face lily is muggle born voldemort killed her parents because their daughter is a witch what come on prongs the connection is right there remus urged realization slowly dawned on james so she thinks it her fault exactly james was on the move all the more reason i need to find her he said she may not be thinking right she might need time remus suggested while following james out again even if it werenther that got caught anything can happen to her it not safe out there how safe do you think hogwarts is remus snapped that was it the cat was out of the bag remus had been thinking a lot over the past few hours all his thoughts were on hogwarts and dumbledore he was eternally grateful to dumbledore because he had accepted him when no one else had and hogwarts was his home the very first place where he had had friends and even brothers the safety of hogwarts was his first priority and he would never let anyone hurt it or anything related to it james stopped what i cantbelieve you you are so lost in yourself that you re going blind to the important things that are going on around you what was we talking up just this morning remus accused he was shocked at his own outbreak but continued anyway not everything in hogwarts is as untouchable as it may seem prongs dumbledore is a powerful wizard maybe the most powerful and he the only one who will stop voldemort i know that you know that dumbledore knows that dontyou think voldemort himself knows that too and here you are risking exclusion because lily doesntwant to come back james exhaled feeling torn but his resolve remained the same he placed a hand on his friend shoulder i know he admitted if the events in the past year are anything to go by there will be a show down eventually something is going to happen and it will happen soon at hogwarts a school with so many students it dumbledore obvious weakness when it happens i think he going to need all the help he can get the younger years are as good as defenseless against voldemort if you re excluded how the hell do you think you can help dumbledore i know the rumors haunt me too because it has too much truth in it for comfort lily might even be safer away from the school maybe but do you think she will be happy to stand aside if voldemort attacks she as part of hogwarts as you and i she wontstand by and watch any more than we would remus i just trying to protect something that is important to me remus fell silent realizing that nothing he could do or say would change james mind fine i ll go with you what that goes against everything we ve just been talking about hogwarts needs you i need you to be here and keep an eye out remus suddenly broke out in a grin i cantlet you go off and get into trouble by yourself can i james returned the grin one in trouble is better than all in trouble besides i need you here to cover my back and i dontwant padfoot knowing about this he ll have his furry ass on his broom straight away and chase me like i a cat then we d all be in trouble remus agreed but i still going it ll be a full moon in a few days james reminded gently fine strike a sore spot remus cried indignantly but knew james was right they arrived outdoors i ll be back as soon as possible i ll cover for your ass like you d do otherwise james said and headed in the direction of hogsmeade dontdo anything stupid prongs i ll try not to james promised with a laugh you sound like my mother maybe you should part time with her i sure she ll like sharing out the nag work shut it donkey remus threw back james laughed and melted into the evening shadows a n i really liked remus in this chapter he shows that he fights for what he cares for too a huge favourable ootp trait but he understanding enough to let james go do what he needs to do sure it takes him a while but he gets there the next chapter is one of my favourites at the moment i hope you will love it and i like forward to reading your reviews and feedback xxx a little meow caught sirius attention as he was making his way to the room of requirement he looked down to see none other than nutmeg what do you want he asked it nutmeg meowed mournfully and looked at his hand oh you want this he d been eating a cornish pasty along the way he d already eaten half of it and he offered the rest of it to the cat nutmeg gratefully polished it off there happy now he started walking again but the tinkling of a bell alerted him that nutmeg was following him what you want now i haventgot anymore food you re getting fat anyway still nutmeg meowed i am not going to stroke you for all i know you ll start targeting me like that chicken he walked on but nutmeg followed him until he reached the room go away i haventgot anymore food the door opened and remus stuck his head out are you talking to a cat padfoot the stupid fur ball keeps following me just let it come in standing outside and talking to a cat can look rather suspicious you know sirius shrugged and went in with nutmeg close behind you ve gone all animal lover lately he said observing chewy on remus shoulder and then nodding at brent it turned out that brent had arrived just before sirius lately i ve always loved animals i am one remus said with little humor sirius pulled his sleeves up right let get these bad boys out he threw a glance at brent who was still hovering by the door the pot in front of them was already simmering remus added a pinch of powdered mink teeth i still dontknow how you managed to get him to cooperate he whispered under his breath sirius gave him a wide grin easy i threatened to hex him remus rolled his eyes but he also grinned nothing like a direct approach right exactly sirius motioned for brent to come closer to the hot cauldron the poor squib looked like he wasntdone from suffering the nightmares of his last encounter in the room of requirement and magic come on sirius repeated this time with a lot less patience brent edged closer but still stopped a good few feet away sirius sighed and wondered briefly what he had done to deserve this before he lunged and yanked brent to the cauldron insulted brent rearranged his clothes and sniffed sirius leaned over the now boiling pot is the stuff really gonna work he said pointing at the bubbling purple liquid of course remus replied brent your task is simple all i need is you to stir the contents of this cauldron with this he handed the ladle to brent who treated it like it would bite him that it siirus folded his arms unimpressed he d secretly been hoping that the spell would involve brent getting squeamish although at a glance he could see that the guy was plenty squeamish already why cantyou or i stir it because we donthave the stone ohh i get it it that rock again handy thing to have isntit pity it in his stomach brent free hand went protectively to his stomach in fear that sirius might suggest cutting it out sirius saw this and he deliberately gave him a wolfish grin suminus protectus remus breathed over the frothing broth and poured a few drops of tortoise oil into it nobody knew what to expect but pretty soon it was apparent that nothing was happening after a minute or two sirius spoke great i bet this happens in our n e w t potions what brent asked curiously absolutely nothing that a fail straight off i thought you didntcare much about education remus said amused sirius ran a hand through his hair yeah well it looks like i going to have to care because you need good grades to be an auror remus raised an eyebrow he had been aware that his friend was interested in the career but it was quite a surprise to see him so committed what you got to smile about anyway the spell didntwork it seems that way sirius threw his hands up exaggerating exasperation on purpose you re supposed to be the brainy one out of the group make it work yeah but with competition like you three it not hard to be the clever one haha real clever sirius picked up the bottle and inspected the peeling label of course what the heck he tipped the entire contents of the bottle into the cauldron keep stirring brent he ordered brent responded by stirring with the ladle furiously there instant reaction he said as the broth began to change color sure but what are the side effects of overdosing a spell remus waved his hand in front of his face as plumes of smoke that was already pouring out beats me sirius coughed and backed away brent had tossed the ladle aside and was out through the door before you could say quidditch do we need him back no the spell is done the smoke was dispersing now leaving the room slightly foggy where are they these protectors sirius flapped his hand about to clear the air in front of him i here came an unfamiliar voice remus jumped for the voice seemed to come from right beside his ear the sudden movement unsettled chewy and he took off and i here came a second voice coming from somewhere at their feet where neither remus nor sirius could see anyone other than themselves standing in the room chewy circled the room once and landed back on remus shoulder i right here he said to remus remus could feel his eyes go wide chewy you re the protector upon hearing this sirius began to laugh honestly moony come up with a better one than that the bat shook its ears i not chewy no but i am in chewy body we protectors have to possess the body of an animal that is the only form in which we can reveal ourselves confused remus picked up the spell book the spell didntmention that part oh yes it does it written in the fine print remus flipped open the book and scanned the page i dontsee any fine print use the attached magnifying glass the bat suggested oh so that was what the small piece of glass attached to the spine of the book via a ribbon was used for with the delicate glass he could now read a very small line at the very bottom of the page he d dismissed it earlier assuming it was just a decorative line of dots to mark the bottom of the page i see he said finally see what because i certainly don t sirius said eyeing the bat with suspicion talking animals were freaky to him no matter what animal it was where are the other two remus asked chewy ignoring sirius the cat and the third creature is not in the room the cat sirius cried staring at nutmeg on the floor yes do you have a problem with that the cat said it furry cat lips forming words perfectly sirius bristled as a matter of fact i do remus had recovered from his initial shock already and he wasntquite as disturbed at the idea as sirius then how the third protector enter the body if the animal is not present the essence of the third creature is in the room nutmeg answered oh really where sirius demanded you re not trying to tell me that the third protector has possessed the body of a spider are you there are plenty of those in here sirius squinted upwards to the dust corners of the ceiling where there was hogwart typical arachnid population if possible the cat rolled his eyes of course not mongrel it said with annoyance the creature essence is on your bag say what who you calling a mongrel why you of course the cat glared at him with its bright eyes muttering under his breath sirius went to his bag it was dusty with one or two marks left by tatty last attack on him there nothing there sirius declared use you eyes mongrel it not that hard to spot a few marks you re lying the only marks on her are sirius stopped in mid sentence are you trying to tell me that the essence you re on about is the shit marks on my bag left by that damn flying chicken yes sirius slapped a hand to his head at the reply nothing ever goes right for us does it it was rhetorical of course when you re done talking to yourself mongrel please be kind enough to rejoin us the cat said with heavy sarcasm sirius hit the side of his head i dontbelieve it i being insulted by a damn cat james sneezed it was cold and he d been out all through the previous night and day with only a brief catnap when tatty had grown tired it was now night time again and tatty had once again made a stop this time near a farm he was kneeling at the top of a slope that overlooked the small farmhouse in the valley below is lily in there or are you stopping for a meal tatty tatty didntanswer instead she shivered as if she were cold and then flew down to perch on a solid branch of a bush next to him james continued to survey the house noting any points of entry that he could use and plotting escape routes if need be it a bit chilly tonight isntit someone said james looked at his owl yeah he replied and returned his attention to the house two seconds passed before james swung his eyes back to stare at his owl the owl stared back with its bright yellow eyes what tatty said wha james started but he lost his balance and found himself rolling at high speed down into the valley in the end a hedge stopped his descent extremely scratched and battered from his fall he sat up half dazed did my owl just talk to me tatty flew silently down to join him that was funny do it again it said to him of all the strange things that james had ever seen in his life this one definitely came within the top five a n soooo what you all think rebecca straightening up he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand a handful of minutes had passed since he had entered the room yet he felt that he d been fighting for hours jamie he turned to lily a smile ready she stared at him her head tilted to one side her eyes fixed on him with disbelief captivated he stared back she was overjoyed to see him he knew it because he could feel it as he felt his own joy at seeing her unharmed her large eyes shone oddly in the yellow light and james thought his heart would melt from the warmth that spread to the very tips of his fingers she moved and he opened his arms automatically to receive her she took a step and began to run james grin grew broader and turned into a grimace when she ran right past his arms to the door rebecca she cried lily went into the next room without a second thought she and james could share their reunion later first she needed to save rebecca damn james cursed it because of this cloak he reassured himself aloud she didntsee me hold out my arms to her he muttered looking sadly at his invisible hands hidden under the cloak lily had already run through the door and hadntheard him at all lovely to see you james hope you didnthurt yourself james thank you for saving me james he continued with humor and headed for the door a large room instead of a bathroom that he had been expecting greeted him an eyebrow went up because the room was apparently empty except for a large ornate chair facing away from him in front of a fire that provided the only light in the whole room surprise gave way to alarm lily with his eyes fixed on the chair his hand went to his back pocket to grasp his wand not so quick a young girl voice said from the chair very slowly the chair lifted and rotated until its occupant was revealed surprise number two james had been expecting a young girl in the chair but instead there was an unmistakably grown man that lounged in the green leather one of his arms was wound around lily neck whilst the other held a wand to his throat hello james his lips moved but the girlish voice came from his mouth james screwed his face in distaste oh man that sick lily would have nodded in agreement were she not held hostage by her neck she was upset and hurt that rebecca had been a fake more than that she was furious that she had been cheated by david tether you she trailed off through gritted teeth hidden under her sleeve was the can of ant spray her finger twitched on the head as she inched her hand upwards david pulled the wand away from his throat and laughed so innocent he said in his own voice his tone almost admiring dumbledore always makes sure that his students remain innocent even till the day they graduate none of them have a clue of the wiles in the real world of magic none let her go tether james growled he had recognized david straight away not before you give me your wand potter actually you can keep it for a while yet since i know that you wouldntwant to jeopardize the well being of a fellow class mate would you after all you are one of dumbledore students you were one of dumbledore students james pointed out instead of answering david said i heard that you might be arriving the corner of james mouth twitched but he didntsay anything someone knew that he was no longer at hogwarts maybe he had been seen en route but more likely than not the information had escaped from the school itself he knew remus would never betray him so it had to be someone else with a mental shake he cleared his suspicions and put the intrigue of hogwarts to rest so that he could focus fully on rescuing lily hmm your father is a thorn in our side an unfortunate but deliberate accident involving his only son might quiet him a bit james kept his poker face but lily stiffened at the threat she couldntand wouldntforgive herself if anything ever happened to james you didntlike that did you david said smiling rhetorically at her lily gave him a dirty look and turned her face away from him as best as she could james potter ah yes i remember you the popular first year you ve grown his eyes flickered down to lily and so have you lily evans james swallowed an uncomfortable lump and anger turned his vision red let her go coming to think of it i remember you two quite well david said ignoring james completely didntyou used to fancy her james didntanswer but his eyes remained pinned on david it was a well known fact that from day one james potter fancied lily evans anyway didntyou david repeated this time he gave lily neck a shake that made her choke yes james gritted out david shrugged conversationally she is pretty i grant you that james was practically steaming if he d ever gotten protective and territorial it was now never in his whole life had he felt so angry and scared at the same time if tether so much as laid a finger on her he swore that he would make every bone in his body disappear tether ran his eyes down lily although it appeared rather inspective than lascivious more like he was looking at a specimen hm david eyes had taken a glazed look and seemed oddly matte looking at least that how it seemed from james point of view oi james shouted out after a few more moments of vacant glazed staring oi little girl psycho whether he d been provoked or not david suddenly spoke as if he d never stopped now tell me what is it that dumbledore thinks that he can achieve james frowned he hadnta clue what david was talking about but maybe he could use this opportunity to get him to talk maybe he d let something slip still the stubborn one i see david gave lily a vicious shake that prompted the desired response wait talk tether demanded he if there was ever a time to bullshit this was it james summoned his natural flair for fabrication if tether wanted information then he would give him information whether it was correct or not was another matter it not what he thinks he can achieve it what he will achieve he informed tether smoothly david shifted in his chair with interest whilst lily gave him a wide eyed look that clearly said what he stronger than voldemort you know james said fishing for more to say even as the words left his mouth david hissed in a way that was definitely more reptilian than man made he is the dark lord you will refer to him as lord unfazed by david snake ish snap james continued to spout out whatever came to mind you know it true everyone knows that the only wizard in the world that voldemort fears is dumbledore he hunting for him right this very minute james was lying about the latter part of course but then again for all he knew it could be true dontbe so na ve dumbledore would not deliberately seek the dark lord tether said although it was unclear whether he was speaking to james or merely clarifying things with himself even if he found him it would not do any good the dark lord influence is too broad and wide no dumbledore is up to something else he gathering people dontthink we dontknow who he visits because we have eyes everywhere yes we know he trying to gather people pathetic people like your father i would not be surprised if they tied themselves to trees with signs saying save the muggles and mudbloods it disgusting david chuckled at his own joke isntyour father a muggle james thought aloud david smug expression faltered and for an instant he looked confused the dark lord owns me he almost whimpered before the maniacal smile reappeared and he gave lily neck a squeeze now james the truth please we know he trying to gather people but what else is he planning fine james said taken aback but still thinking quickly he is trying to gather people but nobody is listening to him go on so he gathering muggles what tether began to laugh a peel of maniacal yet amused laughter echoed strangely in the room james waited patiently for it to subside you may laugh now but you wontbe when the time comes muggles outnumber wizards and witches to the point of tears tether gasped for air dontyou know you re fighting for a lost cause when you see it how does dumbledore expect to win with nothing but muggles to back him up against the most powerful wizards by sheer number james said simply his seriousness finally registering with tether he cannot expect to win they ll lock him up in a loony bin magic is nothing but a fantasy to muggles they ll listen dumbledore has a way he always has a way james replied with such confidence that david began to think twice as highly unlikely and improbable it was it was dumbledore after all the old man was as mad as a bat and certainly wasntplaying with a full deck he walked around in purple earmuffs for goodness sake the dark lord had to know about this dontbe foolish a foreign cold destructive voice seared across his mind david visibly hunched under the power the boy is nothing but lies finish them both they are of no use your your your your wand please kick it over to me tether rasped over the immense internal pressure a pause from james elicited another hard shake on lily neck james released the hand that he had still rested on his wand and plucked out the second wand that he d retrieved from the floor after the fight he dropped it and kicked over the wand that had belonged to the other wizard the wand rolled across the floor and david put his foot on it when it reached him good lily temporarily a forgotten threat reminded him by thrusting her hand upwards and giving him a healthy dose of ant spray at the same time james lunged at david and his wand a loud bang flew out of the wand followed by a siren that kept going until james managed to get hold of it and toss it into the fire the wand was silenced immediately as the flames hungrily ate it up next james tore at david fingers while avoiding his kicking legs as lily continually dosed his face with ant killer david screamed and yelled his free fist gave up on protecting his face from the spray and punched out blindly with a determined pull lily was in his arms and they fell back come on he grabbed her arm and they ran out aware that the house was no longer quiet but alive with running footsteps they reached the top of the stairs but people were already running up them left with no choice james turned and dragged lily around and up the another flight of stairs up into a musty attic and then through the roof door they went there no where to run lily breathed when they emerged into the cold night air for a moment the night was quiet and the angry shouting of pursuit from below could not be heard james slammed the roof door and threw the latch on although he knew it would not hold for long together they edged away on the dangerously slanted roof there has to be a way james looked frantically for a way for them to climb down the side of the house but the lip of the roof jutted out too far for them to even reach the wall we ll apparate lily shook her head sadly i tried earlier to escape but there some kind of anti apparating magic put up maybe i can get around the edge and then i ll help you climb down james said although he could see how impossibly stretchy and flexible he would have to be if he were to do that jamie she edged to him taking pigeon steps to avoid sliding off the roof he held out his hand and she held on i m sorry she managed to say before her breath caught in her throat i didntmean for it okay lily really i james gave her a little shake on the shoulders this is the way things have turned out and it is not your fault he stated lily looked up into his honest face and knew that she was guilty and nothing but guilty but more than that a feeling in her chest swelled it left her overwhelmed and speechless there was a name for this emotion but she did not care for it anymore it was too consuming and it left all her other senses ringing her hands reached up and slipped up his neck her fingers almost touching each other at the base of his skull and she tiptoed and pulled his head down to hers at the same time with a shock their lips touched for the first time a n ultimate cheeeeeeese moment but it had to be done my editors proof readers are threatening to stop reading if i didntput in any mooshy bits a n the last chappie did end up a lot more gory than what i had in mind but i couldntimagine sirius getting freaked by anything remotely mundane so to make him really react i needed something that really grossed him out along with me and everyone else at first i was slightly in two minds over it but in the end i decided that it was a keeper i wanted to see sirius lose his cool and i mean really losing it and what better way than to make him go mad with lily i wanted to show how guilt over a death would never go away no matter how much a person tries to move on even though she doesntknow how her parents died in her mind she has already made up her own version which will ultimately be the worst anyways this chapter was getting insanely long so i chopped it into two thank you all for reviewing i love u xxx reminder james could see it in his eyes madness sirius had gone crazy beyond reasoning and beyond control left with no choice james readied his wand amongst a ring of icy snow lost in a cloud laced with magic and confusion the two best friends began a duel a cauldron of brewing trouble high up in hogwarts tucked in the warm dormitory room that the marauders shared the three guardians were having a heated discussion animal instincts pah nutmeg said haughtily what animal do you know of that instinctively makes farting noises as soon as a person talks chewy despite hanging upside down released a foot and pointed it at tatty who ruffled her feathers indignantly appearing to be offended how else am i to explain these inexplicable urges to make such noises whenever that sirius boy talks nutmeg licked a paw and smoothed it over her ears you can t ouch the cat sprung up and startled chewy into taking flight tatty eyes grew wide and she ruffled her feathers disapprovingly that hurt the cat hissed prodding about on the bed with her claws extended what happened tatty queried with interest nutmeg could sense sirius distantly a shadow of conducted pain crept under her furry paws the cat spasmed again i think the mongrel has gotten himself into trouble she explained shaking her whiskers the problem with being a guardian she decided was when one must guard a group of wizard teenagers take your eyes off them for a few minutes and it like they deliberately try to get themselves killed nothing but a cauldron of brewing trouble pfeh what kind of wizard is he if he canteven look after himself she muttered and the three hurried off straight away i think my one also in trouble tatty said in her silent flight along the corridor i hope he doesntdie he was awfully funny they re not supposed to die nutmeg reminded her forcefully at least not when we re around it was an unwittingly ominous comment that even then managed to hang heavily in the atmosphere like a bitter after taste mine just fine chewy boasted if only he knew i ll kill you sirius was seized by a gripping fervour that james potter had to die they all had to die every last one of them who all why because if there was a reason then that was it because that was all no widely passionate explanation was needed nor could it express his absolute conviction to kill determination sliced with a flinty edge decreed that whether through years of meticulous planning or this one duel sirius black would see it through james potter must die from behind a veil of madness he pointed his wand james was instantly blasted off his feet by a spectacularly powerful curse and in the split second he lay there completely winded another curse struck him and he was air borne once more he landed heavily on ground that sloped at an angle and he used it to help him roll away just in time the space he d landed on erupted into a fountain of snow sure james wand was readied but in the true essence of the word he was nowhere near ready the duel was initiated but high reluctance and disbelief clouded his ability to respond in any way apart from defence what the hell are you doing james cried and dodged again for the life of him he had no idea what had gotten into sirius oi with each near miss he was rapidly becoming less concerned as to why his friend was behaving like a nutcase and more concerned with saving his own skin diffndo sirius was good quick and relentless were his spells and with deadly accuracy james was on the move constantly he needed to keep moving underestimating or overestimating always played a major role in duelling and getting the right expectation was often half the battle won however when both opponents knew each other skills inside and out there was no expectation to be had it was like a very sharp double edged sword and the only thing that determined the way it dropped was so solely based on skill duel now ask questions later if james had to he would knock him out and tie him to a chair for interrogation later because he sure as hell wasntgoing to get any answers when he was busy trying to evade attacks protego james shouted and a severing spell ricocheted off him harmlessly as far as shield charms went he knew that his was stronger than anything sirius could possibly throw at him but he couldntstand there forever in his shield trying to disarm sirius would be nothing short of suicide and james had seen first hand how he would counter attack to the spell not something he ever wanted to experience ever full frontal assault was sirius forte which was why he was currently being hammered down by blasting curses plus a variety out of class ones that sirius was very good at casting to get a battering in james had to out manoeuvre him first or at least catch him off guard he too had his own arsenal of strictly beyond n e w t curses but complicated spells were usually effective at the price of time and more power they would be no good if sirius could spot them a mile off it was for this same reason that sirius had yet to pull out the real dark curses the ones that would get them packaged and owled straight to azkaban not that it seemed like sirius would care in his state he was more concerned that he wouldnthave to be left vulnerable for precious seconds after releasing such a spell at least this was what james thought until he was on the receiving end of one the worse kind of curses crucio sirius used an unforgivable curse out of sheer luck james stumbled on some loose snow and the lethal spell missed him by about a foot he wouldnthave believed it had it not come close enough to singe his hair this wasntjust any mock dueling sirius was playing for keeps unless james took this seriously he was going to end up dead already that bit of realization had hit him a bit late james needed something quick simple something a madness propelled sirius would not expect silencio immediately sirius assault stopped and he clutched his throat in surprise with his voice gone the damage of his spells was instantly halved grabbing the opportunity james fired a high powered stunner stupefy the bolt of red light soared like a powerful loose cannon of a firework and would have certainly rendered sirius unconscious were he not able to create a non verbal shield just in time it was a weak shield that cracked upon contact but it was a shield nonetheless and it saved him he staggered back from the force of the hitting spell before being knocked down completely by another of james spells james knew that he would not stay down not so easily like himself sirius could withstand at least a couple dozen medium powered curses out of pure stubbornness alone it was a theory that they had once tested and found it to be scarily true besides james did not have time to let off another powerful spell or stun sirius repeatedly and it wasntlike he would just stand there and let him do it either remus was still at large and lily was nowhere to be seen there was the other possibility that she was she was no just thinking of it was enough to coat his insides with a deep empty chill all these thoughts and more occupied james mind buzzing like a demanding crowd with a conscious effort he forced it all to a muffle weariness was also threatening to take over for a second he felt the cold that bit into his fingers and his wet clothes sucking heat off his body his arm cradled uselessly at his side while his best friend was trying to kill him it was enough to take any wizard down but james shunted the weariness right to the periphery of consciousness he stomped out a fit of shakes and readied himself to deal with sirius once more a stunner narrowly missed him even as sirius sat up having managed to lift the silencing charm while down damn trust sirius to have one of the quickest recovery time ever a scream suddenly pierced the magic heavy air effectively killing the spell that was about to form on his lips lily lily james repeated aloud completely forgetting about mad sirius and the duel that is until a particularly nasty hex sent him flying face first into the snow he pushed himself up coughing out melted snow as he did sod off sirius there was the scream again and james swallowed hard lily was in trouble i donthave time for this sirius lily needs me without a single twinge of regret he seized a precise moment and blinded sirius with a conjunctivitis curse following it up with a continuous barrage of hurling hexes with a plentiful supply of hard icy snow he fixed the spell to keep it repeatedly hurling thus effectively occupying the blinded sirius his speed was blinding not even sirius with full vision could contend with the sudden quick succession of attacks sirius yelled one hand pressed to his eyes while compacted snowballs pelted him from left right and centre james sprinted away carried by an obsession to find lily in an instant sirius was quite forgotten courtesy of a massive priority shift lily he was close enough to hear her shouting now and he pumped his legs and uninjured arm harder he cleared a hill and looked down to a small valley lily was flailing her arms at someone who fought her to the floor even from a distance he could recognise that back and greasy hair anywhere snape drink this you foolish girl snape snapped angrily it the antidote lily struggled harder but snape kept her pressed into the ground while he poured a vile liquid into her throat she choked and spluttered but he kept pouring it into her prised open mouth snape was breathing heavily it had been more than a struggle to drag her over to his dropped bag and when his fingers closed around the tiny vial of liquid inside it he was relieved the antidote as always he was well prepared with people like lestrange around who knew what could happen he might turn his back and suddenly find his goblet spiked with his own potion severus snape trusted no one the last drop disappeared and lily went limp at once thanks to the bezoar stone the antidote would work double the speed purging her mind of the poison faster than it had spread slowly her eyes rolled back into her head until all that could be seen was the whites the antidote was working he noted dully but she was still bleeding profusely taxed snape released her and drew his wand get the fuck off of her james seized a fist full of snape robes and heaved him off lily throwing him heavily to the ground dontyou dare touch her james was more than enraged he was murderously livid seeing lily attacked had snapped whatever shred of control he had left he glowered menacingly at the slytherin with fierce protectiveness potter snape hissed without warning james grabbed him again ignoring the cry of his scorched arm you greasy snake he was too furious to even finish instead he smashed his fist into snapes face with one more solid punch snape dropped to the ground without uttering another word or raising his wand once droplets of blood leaked from his hooked nose but the amount was insignificant in comparison to the stains on lily all at once the anger vanished and he was at lily side pulling her cold body into his arms for an awful moment he thought that she might be dead until he saw the faint rise and fall of her shallow breathing the relief that it brought was truly immense and it washed him in a wave of giddiness however as relieved as he were that she was still breathing her face petrified him her skin carried a deathly pallor and her lips were tinged with blue most hauntingly scary were her eyes her large beautiful eyes stared sightlessly at him lily he cradled her closer feeling like he had never been so scared in his life because all he could see was the white of her eyes not even the steady beat of her heart under his palm could reassure him oh merlin what did he do to you he wailed wanting to hurt snape more than ever there was blood everywhere he shuffled across the snow with her body on his lap to his dropped wand and sealed up her atrocious wounds as best as he could but he really wasntany good at field dressings dontworry baby i ll get you to pomfrey he said in hushed whispers he continued to speak to her positive that she could hear him as he carried her across the courtyard as quickly as he could you re gonna be fine you re gonna be fine you re gonna be fine he found himself repeating to reassure her as much as himself halfway there her hitched her limp body back against him still muttering a flow of sentences dontworry evans lily you ll wake up soon and you can shout at me all you want call me a toe rag hey it not too bad of a name i can deal with being called a toe rag but do you know what it even okay if you dontever want to see me again it is just wake up soon honey in his semi rambling pleading he had failed to notice lily stirring in her dreams she fought her way to consciousness the effort wore her to the bone but still she struggled scrabbling to sink her fingers into something substantial outside of her terrifying dream world her fingers slipped and darkness welcomed her enticingly no with a desperate cry she tore through an invisible barrier and broke the surface of the waking world with her mind in one piece no demons dared to follow into the cold reality that received her with a nipping bite james lily blinked did she just hear him ask to be called a toe rag she was cold and confused this must be what it felt like to be confunded she thought distantly while trying to make sense of his expressions she tried to sit up forcing him to put her to the ground merlin beard lily are you okay but he didnteven get to hear her answer because he sensed something familiar i think so ow her arms hurt and the sight of the angry half closed welts on them horrified her oh my g it was all real james i thought that it was a nightmare james wasntlistening he wasnteven looking at her anymore james in one fluid motion he pushed her behind his back and he faced the way that they had come go back to the castle he ordered tensely what this wasnthelping her confusion she studied his face for clues to shed some light but he was fixed onto something in the distance his brows creased and his eyes focussed on it with intensity do it the sharpness of his tone alarmed lily cautiously she peered around his arm and squinted following his line of vision oh no remus the creature closed in on them slowly stalking them as it would its prey there was no hurry it wanted them to know that it was there she pulled out her wand and moved to stand beside him but james held his uninjured arm out in front of her no you re going to get help he said firmly with an eerie calm lily was struck by d j vu when confronted with a werewolf she had ran last time but not this time this time she had a wand and it seemed that the stakes were higher she had much more to lose she could lose james even wounded and battered her stubbornness reared i staying james wasnthaving any of it listen to me lily you re hurt sirius needs help remus has transformed on a half moon that more than we can handle i going to need help and you re going to have to get it for me lily bit her lip more than anything she wanted to stay and help but there was no denying the solid logic that james forcefully presented in hushed undertones she wasntin any condition to fight off a werewolf excessive blood loss had left her light headed and unsteady she would only hinder james and any mistakes would end up fatal there were more lives at stake than she had even thought after what seemed like an eternity to james she gave him a curt nod she had to leave him but she was terrified of never seeing him again all right i ll get help but potter dontyou dare do anything stupid because i will kill you if you do she said with as much brutal force as she could muster despite her ferocious tone her eyes shone brightly and he could almost imagine a tear falling and leaving frozen trail down her face but it bravely stayed for his sake leaving him behind was clearly the hardest decision she had ever made and every inch of her was fighting it james could feel her fear and he loved her even more for it it comforted his heart like a warm embrace and he knew that he would do everything within his power to hear her threaten him again a shadow of a smile pressed his mouth until it widened to one of his favoured crooked grins i ll see you soon evans he said almost casually despite himself with one last piercing look that lingered lily ran and james focussed everything he had on remus the werewolf it had reached him at last james had his own reasons for staying he did not want to leave sirius alone he may still be capable of casting spells but he wasntthinking right it also didntmatter how powerful a wizard was if he was blinded it may take less than a few minutes for a clever wizard to lift the curse but it most certainly took less than a few minutes to be eaten alive to a lesser degree he also couldntbring himself to abandon snape to freeze to death or be eaten by remus he couldntdo that to a person he despised and he definitely couldntdo that to one of his best friends having thought that he also added that it was all snape fault and vowed to give him a good hexing when he got out of this the wolf watched lily go james whistled sharply and it turned to face him once more you re dealing with me he growled softly it was a challenge that the werewolf picked up on with relish it liked prey that fought back a very wet guttural snarl came forth from the wolf and it gnashed its teeth as if trying to crunch his fingers and striving to rip its claws into him james allowed it no such chance man and beast circled warily his limbs tingled strangely and his sense of perception changed as his heart pumped adrenaline liberally around his body he once heard that when a person life was in danger common sense was often stripped leaving all but a core of instinct whether that person survived or not depended on that core and often it was also the defining element to whether that person was destined to be prey or predator james knew that he was neither he held his ground moony james couldntsay this is not you or you re not yourself because they were all lies being a werewolf was part of his best friend whether anyone said it aloud or not the moment that he was bitten condemned him as one for the rest of his life killing would become part of his nature once a lunar cycle no matter what he did james pushed these uncomfortable thoughts aside he could spend all night trying to reason with remus but the only way a werewolf would answer was its teeth the wolf circled too close to allow him sufficient time to transform and he knew that should he break eye contact at this crucial moment his friend would have his throat ripped out in an instant it snarled once and then it was airborne springing at james with a savage maw of sharp teeth a n wheee next chapter is mors mordre a n i ve changed my mind on the title of this chapter changes lily lay awake on her bed a shaft of light from the window filtered in through a gap on her bed curtains when she held her hand up the moonlight hit the ring on her finger in such a spectacular way that she was mesmerized if it werentfor this ring she would have never known that like most girls she could turn into jelly at the sight of such an amazing diamond she turned onto her stomach still inspecting the ring he has good taste she thought with a girlish giggle two marginally smaller ones flanked the centerpiece of a diamond and the three were set in an intricate band of white gold that twisted and twirled into a ring she quietly giggled some more as she thought back to james expression of awe and pure surprise when she had nodded the kiss resurfaced next and she could feel her cheeks grow hot even in the dark and she buried herself into her pillow feeling happily squeamish inside with these happy thoughts she finally drifted to a contented sleep the next day lily arrived to breakfast late having woken up to an already empty dorm james was flicking through the paper while everyone ate around him she glided into the seat beside him still unable to shake off the dream like state that had arrested her from the night before morning she chirped happily she received a few grunts from the marauders with the exception of james who grinned at her widely what are you reading she asked peering over his paper looking for somewhere to live after graduation he held the brightly colored page open to her what do you prefer apartment or house hmmm lily very nearly wondered aloud why her preference mattered but the obvious quickly saved her oh yes lily oh her sarcastic self commented after graduation she had no home to go to and now that she had accepted james proposal well it would only be natural that they would live together that brought another type of oh to lily mind why on earth had something as important as that not occurred to her until now suddenly nervous she tugged at a bit of her hair sirius was in the middle of an eye watering yawn when he choked on air at the sight of her hand more specifically the exposed ring on her finger dear merlin and his beard prongs what got into you he demanded loud enough for everyone to turn in their direction with interest if lily falls into the lake with that rock she gonna drown not to mention that the giant squid plus all the mermaids will be insanely jealous he announced referring to her ring he reached over to hold her hand up for all to see while pretending to inspect it light reflected off it dangerously drawing even more attention interesting finger to have it on dear lily he added people began fluttering over with excitement and lily snatched her hand back with something like bewilderment settling in as a crowd of thrilled girls closed in james was giving sirius the evil eye and his friend responded with a clear so what look i take it all is well remus asked mildly all was well james grimaced as sirius jumped to his feet and began flagging as many people over as he could congratulations mate remus slapped james on the back hard everything has finally fallen into place he smiled broadly at lily and leaned over the table dontworry you ve made a fine choice he whispered but pulled away quickly as one of the gryffindor girls squealed at an alarming octave and dove at lily james was quickly shoved aside by an army of girls even peter sirius and remus were shoved well out of the way and had to shuffle quite a way down the table james would have tried fetching lily but the wall of girls that appeared in front of him was rather scary oh my gosh lemme see that ring is huge does that mean that it true did james really propose how did he do it what did he say did he really propose in class in front of everyone too much was happening in one go lily turned left then right back and then forwards as everyone tried to talk to her and ask questions all at once she swore that she even heard someone ask what her answer was but she was thankfully saved from answering duh the ring is on her finger what do you think when the wedding can i be your bride maid lily ears began to hurt ask him she stuck her hand in the air and waved it in his direction james wanted to cower behind the paper but luckily for him none of the girls even gave him a second glance they all wanted the first hand account from the young bride to be only towards the end of breakfast time did the crowd thin out and the guys dared to return by this time lily was in a state of mild shock that was really really really scary james nodded in agreement hoping that she hadntspotted him hide behind the paper she pulled off the ring here you wear it james looked horrified he proposed yesterday and now she was already returning the ring to him put it back on a cool female voice came from behind lily and james swiveled to find rosie standing there arms half crossed with a small smile a voluntary smile from her was so rare that lily wordlessly slid the ring back on it must have taken a lot to make you put it on in the first place and i know that you wouldntlike to see it come off so easily she said james almost applauded her it did take an awful lot to get her to put the ring on and he hoped that she was right and it wouldntcome off too easily congratulations on your engagement she said evenly lily jaw dropped as realization hit her like a stunner bloody hell you re absolutely right i engaged now she had been so caught up with the proposal that any thoughts for the implications hadntquite sunk in yet hence the oh over the house preference earlier on sirius sniggered i see that you did a wonderful job there prongs the girl didnteven know that she was engaged james blushed uncharacteristically and lily realizing her faux pas jumped back in to correct it that not what i meant i know i engaged but i just didntknow know and now i do well kinda but i getting used to the idea she stuttered sirius had one eyebrow raised to her nonsensical sentence and she decided to give up on explaining her rather complicated and confused feelings more to the matter james looked like he might have a cardiac arrest if she continued just shut up sirius sirius gave her wide eye wonder oh my jumping to his defense already shut up james and lily said in unison sirius stared back at them mouth agape that just scary he made an elaborate show of shuddering the next thing will be matching robes just you wa potter black mcgonagall barked from behind ayhh the whole row of students jumped and someone quickly stifled a surprised yelp by clearing their throat even rosie stood a little straighter she took pride in being a girl that never let her imagination run wild before her but she swore that she could see hot air escape from the deputy head flared nostrils were it not for her pressed robes and polished exterior she would have passed very well for a deranged hippogriff james and potter swiveled to meet mcgonagall glare and wordlessly pointed at each other in a mutual whatever it was it was his fault lily saw this and covered her smile with a hand already she was sorting through possible scenarios and contemplating how best to get them away with as light of a punishment as possible in the past she might have crossed her arms with satisfaction that the marauders were getting their comeuppance but now it seemed that they had won her over completely she nudged remus lightly what did they do this time she mouthed to him he gave a little shrug and continued to sip his coffee for he had seen it many times there no need for pointing fingers the professor said briskly the two when things go awry it usually happens that you are all responsible remus coughed into his coffee before clearing his throat carefully it seemed that all definitely included him too even if she did not bark out his name sirius appeared to be put out by all sorts awry he was expecting something more like catastrophic although disastrous would have been okay anyhow it looked like he had to step it up if he was to leave a permanent mark on good old hoggy warts history and perhaps a big fat splotch on mcgonagall sanity maybe he should set snape greasy hair alight it wouldntbe too hard and it would be rather amusing even if it did get him drop kicked out of the school nah that would suck he decided getting kicked out of anywhere because of snape was not worth it his entertaining trail of imagination ground to a stop leaving him with wistful ideas mcgonagall glared at them somewhat dismayed that their previously rapt attention was already failing james was scratching his head absent mindedly and she could already see sirius attention drifting off with a sigh she wondered if there would ever be anything that got through to her most troublesome pair of students it was suddenly overwhelming that these young men were no longer the boys she once had under he care no matter how she treated them there was no doubt that they were more than ready to leave the school and embark on the rest of their lives no doubt terrorizing the rest of the wizarding world with their mischievous ways while they were at it mcgonagall unconsciously touched her throat as she often did when james and sirius were the topic of a matter it was something developed reflexively perhaps to stop herself from throttling them at times you could say that they were the bane of existence but now she was oddly proud of them especially with the news she had for them you ve both applied to train as aurors it wasnta question really since she was the one who wrote their references and corrected their personal statements in the application process she thought guiltily to her quill hovering over the parchment while she pondered what and more specifically how much to write about them it wasntas if she had lied in the references the pair were remarkably skilled wizards with plenty of wits to throw about maybe a little too much giving them a troublesome edge at being roguish but just because she happened to omit that fine detail in the reference it didntmean that she was lying sure the pair could be a handful but they were damn good wizards and she would rather lose her teaching credentials than see the ministry lose out on recruiting talent such as theirs have you got good news lily asked anxiously although james and sirius continued to look as untroubled as ever mcgonagall allowed a small smile indeed both mr potter and mr black have passed the initial sorting and will soon have to prepare for interviews she also gave rosie a small nod to tell her that she too had passed although no one save rosie saw it james and sirius exchanged one look before giving each other a celebratory palm slap excellent they chimed however ah here we go there the however if you wanna join us you ve gotta strip naked and do a monkey dance or something sirius sighed dramatically the things we do to get into the ministry however mcgonagall continued more forcefully hogwarts will shortly be receiving a guest who will be examining candidates as part of the selection process i dontthink that they ve ever done that before lily noted surprising mcgonagall somewhat if there was anything that she relied on it was james and sirius extremely laid back attitude to almost everything she hadntbeen expecting questions on the arrangement and given the circumstances she thought it was best that the students thought it was part of the standard auror selecting protocol nevertheless i want you two to treat our guest with utmost respect as you may find out soon enough that he has very little patience for games and tricks she warned sirius snorted sounds like a boring old fart dare you say that to his face then i quite sure you will be given an appropriate response she said coolly sirius grinned now that sounded a lot like a challenge to him he made a mental note call guest an old fart and see what happens professor do you know who the examiner is lily asked yes as a matter of fact i do his name is alastor moody an old friend of headmaster dumbledore might i add if possible sirius grinned wider if she was hoping to deter him by putting dumbledore in his face she was quite wrong mad eye moody james said thoughtfully my parents talk about him all the time best auror the ministry has ever known hmmm lily was suddenly worried for james and sirius from what she d read about the auror moody he was not someone to play coy with and the twosome were all about playing coy just to see if they could get away with it still she never knew that aurors actually turned up at schools to examine candidates it must be a new thing what do the candidates have to do the headmaster has decided that this year the candidates will take over one lesson each teaching a class of younger years any topic they may choose within the subject boundaries the examiner will simply observe sounds straight forward enough will the professors watch too james asked if anything it seemed too simple he was prepared for a hardcore interview that was both physically and mentally taxing in every way it was no small rumor about how insanely hard it was to become an auror little did he know that all of that fun was yet to come mcgonagall shook her head no it will just be the examiner but i warning you two now if anything goes wrong i will have you in detention for the rest of your natural lives lily heart sank with dismay so many things could go wrong in so many different ways especially with those two involved james rubbed the back of his head threats were nothing new to him have they allocated our subjects yet yes james you have to teach a lesson in defense against the dark arts and sirius you have transfiguration rose you shall teach charms sirius chocked on air she applied to be an auror too he asked incredulously rosie sent him an acid stare and mcgonagall ignored his question altogether i would like to remind you sirius that you still owe me a presentation report she said firmly but sirius was already looking elsewhere black she barked and he turned to look at her as if surprised that she was still standing there i sorry professor he began tragically it just that i cantseem to concentrate you know with james engagement and all i going to be best man you see hey i thought we all were peter suddenly said and sirius only winked at him it appeared that all he wanted to do was distract mcgonagall from the whole homework issue and to his surprise it seemed to work remarkably well lily saw her press her thin mouth into a line while her sharp eyes slid to the exposed ring on her finger congratulations she said at last her expression unreadable until it melted to a suppressed smile it brings joy to me in ways i cannot express her words were truly heartfelt and coming from mcgonagall lily felt that it was even more precious thank you james said and she echoed mcgonagall nodded and swept away leaving them to stare after her she not as cold as she makes herself out to be james observed lily couldntagree more but first things first how the hell am i supposed to teach you ll be fine lily automatically reassured sirius nodded enthusiastically yea trust me teaching will be a doddle what are you gonna do sirius shrugged oh this and that this is a button point my wand and now this is a beetle and as soon as they get bored i ll start transfiguring the students that will keep them on their toes if you get it wrong then i ll turn you into a chair etc etc james chuckled mcgonagall is gonna kill you just as well that she wontbe there so that why she shouts at us like that james said thoughtfully it like she pre shouting at us what a waste of breath she only gonna do it all again afterwards she just used to shouting at you lot lily said heaven knows i should be shouting at you all the time too mcgonagall hurried away to the headmaster tower lily was right it was unheard of that the ministry would ever send a representative to examine students at the school for entry into auror training for the simple fact that it has never happened the test itself was real enough but the reason behind it was not the headmaster has long thought that a few of his best students would be an invaluable asset to the order however other members had reservations against recruiting members so young but the order where in dire need of manpower mcgonagall herself had rather mixed opinions on the matter she could see the necessity and was a witness herself to how resourceful the few students that the headmaster had in mind were but the danger was great a very good morning to you minerva dumbledore greeted her warmly and to you albus as always the headmaster was calm and collected and for once mcgonagall felt unsettled by his air of tranquility i dontthink it too good of an idea anymore albus the order can look elsewhere for members she said as always she was straightforward and to the point dumbledore raised a bushy white eyebrow in polite question mcgonagall grimaced i know that you had great hopes in james and lily she trailed off uncomfortably not just james and lily but sirius remus and rose too he said helping her along sometimes i wonder if we are doing the right thing they are so young age can mean very little james and lily they re getting married she said abruptly if anything were to happen i i see the headmaster said quietly and a full minute passed before he spoke again but perhaps we may think of it another way it may give them strength how can it getting married doesntmake hardship go away i think that they will see that too if anything it will give them something to protect their happiness we all already know the importance that it holds in each of our hearts once more if moody agrees after meeting them then it is entirely in their own hands to choose whether to join the order loyalty is only ever true if it is voluntary and you have no doubt that moody will agree that i can see dumbledore admitted as such moody is precautious but he will eventually see the reasoning by which i stand by we need the help of these young people mcgonagall sighed with heavy resignation once the invitation was extended by the order she knew that none of them would decline it the students were a good bunch and would do what they believed was right she knew that their loyalty to dumbledore was as sure as her own and they would not hesitate to make a stand against voldemort what happens after that the students will undoubtedly agree to join the order how then will you approach lily and remus they have not applied to train as aurors and that is the only excuse we have come up so far for moody to come within contact with them without appearing too suspicious i was rather hoping that once james sirius and rosie join it would open a way for them once moody ascertains their abilities the order will hopefully be more open it is all that we can do at the moment to introduce the students i understand dumbledore gave a little sigh too minerva i agree completely with your worries could i have my way i would bear it all myself but i am but one wizard and there are times that we must admit that we are all in need of a helping hand i know i know albus mcgonagall said sadly she only knew too well sometime later james and lily sat together idly chatting in front of the roaring fireplace in the common room for a while both secretly thought that their small little world was perfect life went on as usual but it seemed like such an alien thing something that they knew existed but was momentarily unimportant for once comfortable was the word that best described them at this point james for his part was stretched out lazily across the wide sofa with his legs propped up on the rectangular tea table one languid arm draped loosely across lily who was half curled against him this he decided was definitely a perfect night in okay so there were screaming first years all over the room and a massive marauder style exploding snap mini tournament in the corner but given his state it didnttake much to ignore them lily shifted slightly and her hair brushed against his nose tickling him enough to encourage an almighty sneeze sorry he said and they both shifted back into position again bless you she said automatically why never mind she replied not too bothered in explaining instead she continued with her sketching what are you drawing he asked pushing his chin down to look at the pad of cartridge paper that she had precariously balanced on his stomach it was a very lazy way of drawing if he must say so himself and he was proud lily never did any thing lazy that is unless she was with him he kinda liked being a table for lily although he couldntfigure how she managed it with her face leaning against his right shoulder she only held out her hand to sketch and he had to hold the pad steady over stomach so it didntslide everywhere athistle she murmured he nodded thoughtfully bookle warp what precisely she gave a small laugh it a plant used in healing she explained cool just as long as it isnta porptule she smiled and continued to pencil in the graceful lines of the leaves they fell into a comfortable quiet until james spoke again can i ask you something mmm hmm why did you say yes not that i trying to make you change your mind in any way of course he added hastily to what james had to resist rolling his eyes it canthave been that much of a life changing question if the girl could keep forgetting about it that he said pointing to her ring oh that lily felt rather than saw james smile yes that hmmm that easy it is for the life of him he couldntrecall which part of it being easy i figured that if i said no then lots of girls would suffer but if i said yes than i would be the one who suffered she answered playfully i very impressed he said going along with what he hoped was a joke very noble of yourself to sacrifice like that for the greater good of course so how come lots of girls would suffer if you said no then she shifted so that she could look up at him couldntresist could you she teased course not so go on explain she sighed well with your tally hey there werentthat many one look from lily stopped him there weren t he insisted regardless really i seem to remember quite a few she started to count names ticking them off on her fingers as she went and i think these were only the ones that i noticed when i bothered to check that you were still alive not that it was hard when you re an irritating little toe rag day in day out james thought and did a mental tally of himself she was right there were quite a few that she d left out but some things are best left unsaid he decided to allow her jibe after all it didnttake an idiot to know that the fastest way to get rid of a girl was to start talking about exes now that he knew what he mustntdo it was down to whether lily would let it drop who was he kidding of course she wouldn t so so what he feigned dumb the best thing he for him to do was pretend complete ignorance to the topic how come there were so many she persisted oh shit there were many answers to such a question but most of them were probably the wrong ones he was about to reply with because you didntwant to go out with me but somehow he knew that it wasntthe right one uh he started stalling for time because because she prompted shit uh he considered keeling over like he did the last time he was caught in a dead end but he had a feeling that lily wouldntfall for it a second time yes i i guess i wanted to know that you were the one for me he started awkwardly from the first day of school when i saw you it was like bam this is your life james potter this is the girl for you it was just so completely sudden that even i had doubts especially after that massive slap maybe at some point i d hit my head or you d hit me extra hard and i got it into my head that you were for me true i went out with other people but i realized that there was always something off there wasntthat feeling yea that feeling how can i explain it it like this extra special thing that wouldntgo away even when you almost slapped my face off he trailed off and lily could see him thinking hard for the right explanation he didntgo on to remind her how the first slap had happened but lily remembered it well enough as usual he had been a bit of a prat and lily was feeling a tad sensitive that day and it ended up with a rather violent response that she admitted might have been a small overreaction well you was a bit of an arrogant piece of snot that day she commented drawing james out of his thoughts that a lovely compliment to give to your husband it seemed that his future wife wasntin the least abashed about kicking the ego of her husband into the ground in fact he suspected that she rather enjoyed it lily looked quite taken aback husband she gulped having observed her reaction he let out an exaggerated sigh when is it ever gonna sink in oh quit acting like a tragic victim she scolded with a laugh he took her about the shoulders you lily evans are going to be the wife of james potter and he gonna be your husband he stated gravely with the amount of times i keep saying this i gonna start sounding like sirius but bloody hell a n hope you enjoyed it click the review button time the next chapter is wand astray a n wow this chapter has been too long in the making please bear with me guys while i get back into the flow of writing it good to be back the condition james ascended the spiral stairs two at a time anxious to see dumbledore not for the meeting but to see if he had news on sirius the lesson should have ended within the first hour after lunch but sirius remained suspiciously missing for the whole afternoon at the top james knocked and entered at the bidding of mcgonagall which told him straight away that dumbledore wasntin his office sure enough he entered to find the office empty except for professor mcgonagall although describing the room as empty was technically untrue portraits occupied most of the wall space and the nosy occupants of past headmasters and headmistresses stared down at him all of them inspected him with somewhat odd expressions take a seat the headmaster will be along shortly mcgonagall said uneasy under the scrutiny of the portraits james took the offered chair to find mcgonagall giving him the same queer look not usually one to be self conscious james became painfully aware of every set of eyes focusing on him in the room minutes ticked by and james began to fidget under the hot scrutiny mcgonagall appeared preoccupied with her thoughts and would occasionally sigh and james wasntabout to make small talk instead his curiosity urged him to observe dumbledore office from where he sat it was a fascinating room every time he was there he had to resist going around and having a good fiddle with the hundreds of artifacts that the eccentric headmaster had in his collection there were a few things that he recognized but many that he did not in the corner stood some strange looking spindly spinner things that he hadnta clue about and he couldnteven imagine its function but next to that in a hidden alcove was a pensieve the discovery of its existence was purely by chance of course james had no doubt that within its depths was an impressive library of thoughts that only a great wizard such as dumbledore could collect he was curious but had never sneaked a peak for he knew that they were private although sirius would beg to differ but then the opportunity to have a look had never been presented clunk step clunk step clunk james was on his feet in an instant at the sound of the distinct walking pattern moody his hand jumped to his wand mcgonagall also stood more out of surprise at james sudden defensive move than the sound of moody coming up the stairs the heavy door flew open hitting the wall with a bang and the auror entered without even bothering to knock alastor mcgonagall exclaimed obviously appalled ignoring her moody maneuvered himself heavily to the center of the room hmph he put up quite a fight he grunted and dumped a soot colored ferret onto dumbledore desk fawkes who had been dozing up to till this point gave a dignified squawk at the disturbance before eyeing the ferret with interest the little creature scrabbled to its paws spitting and hissing james stared at it with fascination the ferret had a cute little pink nose and tufts of glossy fur framed its face in a manner that was stylish the little thing had one front paw raised with its sharp claws curled into a ball if he didntknow better it would have looked like it was waving a fist at moody the ferret sniffed sulkily and released one claw in what was unmistakably a rude finger salute james jaw dropped at the ferret very un ferret like behavior uh alastor mcgonagall cried clocking on before james we do not transfigure students i know it a shame moody growled and james swore he could see a look of glee under that scarred face padfoot james voiced incredulously who else could be turned into a ferret and still have that insane amount of attitude and that fur what kind of ferret would ever have fur like that sirius the ferret crossed his arms moodily with a quick wave of the wand mcgonagall had sirius restored to his natural shape and size disgruntled and sulky he pushed himself off the desk advancing on moody angrily that was a cheap shot padfoot james started by merlin foot prongs you should have seen some the curses this old codger was trying on me curses are fine because i was defending myself just fine when he took the dirtiest shot in magic history he turned me into a ferret and then he had the nerve to put me in a cage and leave me there in a cage while he toddled off somewhere probably getting addled by whatever he has stashed in his hip flask moody appeared every bit unfazed to say the least if you got hit by a spell the only person you can blame is yourself you were too slow and you got slower the more tired you got you were able to defend yourself decently but you tire too quickly when your opponent is strong he retorted it doesntmatter what kind of shot it is as long as it works the sooner you learn that the better wizard you will be it had been a long time since sirius had so clearly been out skilled and it pained him greatly to see moody gloat in his sick sadistic and sad glory oh really old man do you wanna try that again this time i ll be more than ready moody cackled clearly nowhere near impressed by sirius hot temper i wouldntmind giving it another go as long as you dontmind being turned into a ferret again now that already an advantage given to you laddie because in the real world no one will give you a second chance no you d be dead dead as a belly up carple dead the auror raspy voice hung heavy in the air whilst sirius fumed on taking the younger wizard silence as a victory moody went on not the same kind of teaching that they give you in school ay no no more coddling for you boy out there all you have are your wits and you wand constant vigilence is the only thing that will save your skin with that he reached to his side and pulled out a hip flask from which he took a swig sirius meet moody eye for eye literally because moody other eye was going haywire and whizzing in the socket like glass bouncy ball it was tremendously gross and distracting still from under the scarred eyelid of his one good eye sirius met his gaze straight on moody infuriated him however he did recognize the wisdom of experience in the verbal diarrhea the auror was spewing in his general direction but that didntstop him thinking that the man was a complete asshole i d rather be dead than to let you get away with thinking you had me over so easily he informed him haughtily moody laughed and it sounded like a bizarre parody of the laughing man in red james had once seen in a shopping mall in london one christmas the boy has spirit i ll give him that but i stick by what i said before you re going to get yourself killed i not a boy sirius roared his deep undoubtedly mature voice filling the circular room that difficult to tell from your magic moody said clearing enjoying tormenting sirius sirius hand clenched his wand tighter but he was too wound up to think of a decent spell you see this yea take a good look at it coz it gonna go right up your james seized sirius arm before he could finish what would have been a non retractable comment mcgonagall looked appalled and dumbledore cleared his throat drawing attention to him no one had even noticed him enter the room with a swish of his long robes he swept into the room followed by rosie who was tailing after him a good evening to you all he greeted and took his place at his desk everyone mumbled a reply and even moody nodded his head do seat yourselves comfortably he said and conjured up three more chairs james pushed sirius in the seat furthest from the one moody had chosen before settling down rosie sat to his left the three of them faced dumbledore expectantly today had been a strange day even by hogwarts standards dumbledore looked straight back at them his demeanor calm his blue eyes giving nothing away i sure the three of you must have questions but i would like to ask you keep hold of them until you have heard all that i have to say the three students nodded a little apprehensively there was something deeply unsettling about dumbledore tonight perhaps it was his serious tone or maybe a trick of the light in his office but he appeared a lot less eccentric grandpa and something that none of them could but their finger on let me begin by apologizing to the three of you i have not been completely honest with you today tests had nothing to do with your applications to become aurors sirus brows shot up and he was on his feet in a second so he not from the ministry moody let out a cackle of a laugh why does that change things for you boy i not a boy sirius roared black you sit down this instant mcgonagall reared as sirius began to mutter profanities that would normally have reduced the house pounts to sub zero and watch your mouth potty mouth or i ll have gryffindor disqualified from quidditch even if it my own house her threat had the desired effect and sirius sat down without another word a lump formed in mcgonagall throat these youngsters her pupils should be concerned about things such a sport they should not have to be part of the horror of a twister dark wizard but dumbledore was right what could be worse than to leave the young in the dark without the knowledge to even know what they might face should the order fail what could be more cruel than to leave them unprepared dumbledore was as grave as james had ever seen him i invited alastor here today to test you in ways that are completely beyond the curriculum but are absolutely necessary for what i am about to ask of you james listened enraptured as dumbledore talked on his response grew from surprise to understanding and finally grave acceptance at one point he looked over at sirius and saw his thoughts reflected on his face the order of the phoenix for all this time that he d wished that someone would do something against voldemort he would never have realized something was being done right under his nose all in secrecy because the ministry was too scared or even worse too foolish to even recognize that something had to be done even before dumbledore had finished james knew that whatever the order was planning he wanted to be part of it i understand that this is a lot for you to take in and i promise you that if i could bear this burden alone i would gladly do so but the truth is that my strength alone is limited dumbledore sighed and james could feel the weight of his sigh i in sirius said quietly his anger long gone perhaps if you take some time to think this through sirius shook his head at the headmaster this is something that i ve been waiting to hear something has to be done and i want a part in it besides you need someone like me he ended rakishly and i rosie said her eyes glossy with determination no further consideration is needed mcgonagall sat back she knew their answers even before they did but it was very difficult not to see the two young men and lady as the children that had been in awe of her during her first transfiguration demonstration dumbledore no doubt in her mind might be having similar thoughts though he controlled it better than she i will join the order but only on one condition all eyes went to james this was the first time he d voiced anything on the matter oh i know that i am being overly presumptuous by having a condition james kept his eyes fixed on the fine pattern of whorls on dumbledore desk as if committing it to memory but i feel that personally this is what i need i realize that by joining the order i could very well be offering my life for a cause that is right but lily sirius said with sudden understanding james nodded meeting the headmaster clear eyes squarely i will join the order on the condition that she is not allowed to join the three students traipsed down the corridor each solemnly quiet with thoughts on what had transpired in dumbledore office sirius was the first to break out of his dark thoughts and he riled on rosie how come moody didntattack you sirius asked accusingly rosie made a face you didntsee me before dumbledore fixed me yes and i said fixed that was how badly i came off she said scathingly when sirius brows went up this made sirius feel somewhat a little better what did he turn you into i not telling you why well what did he turn you into i not going to tell you either fine james what did moody turn black into a ferret james answered absentmindedly prongs that betrayal sirius protested but james was once again lost in a troubled reverie meanwhile rosie was having trouble containing her laughter a ferret the wizard is nuts but i beginning to like his humor what bloody humor if you mean the dirty shot trying to kill student humor then ra de ha ha it was one hell of a joke but then you would find something like that funny sure would james walked on ahead oblivious that he d left the bickering behind what wrong with him rosie asked as they watched his back recede into the shadows sirius knew his friend he and james were very similar in many ways but yet there were some fundamental differences james was brought by loving parents and was inclined to love by rule whereas sirius who was brought up by parents who cared only for bloodlines and power loved by exception now that james had lily this difference was never clearer sirius took comfort in knowing that he would never lose more than his life should he die but it would not be so for his friend nothing that a bottle of fire whisky wouldnttemporarily fix he replied flippantly say i have a vintage bottle tucked away what say you to an early celebration lily was up on her feet a soon as she heard the portrait open james from across the room james met her eyes in the dim light they simply burned there was something very poignant in that moment something in the way she anxiously wringed her hands with worry her face more open to him than ever before he walked up to her and wordlessly wrapped her into a tight hug lily swallowed hard as her fingers automatically clenched the sleeve of his shirt something wasntright jamie what is wrong she asked hating how small her voice sounded he pulled back slightly to look into her face his fingers brushing her cheek and following the contours of her face nothing nothing at all he said at length and pressed his lips to her forehead where they stayed while they stood in front of the crackling fire lily did not for one second believe him but she clamped her mouth on questions and closed her eyes they parted silently not two minutes later lily could see a thin but stout wall wedge itself between them as james straightened his shoulders from whatever it was that was immensely bothering him distracted and appearing almost apologetic lily couldntquite put her finger on it but in that state he excused himself and went up to his room lily resumed her seat staring thoughtfully at the stairs it bothered her something was on his mind and she was inclined to assume that it wasnta good thing occupying his thoughts judging from his demeanor she wanted to go after him because she simply couldntlet it go he probably needed time to think things over and it really wasntany of her business if he did not want to confide with her this she understood completely since she was a firm believer in having your own personal space in relationships at length concern won over and she left her warm seat and began to tiptoe up the stairs she might not be able to help him but she could offer him comfort it was a small offer but it was enough to make her happier for it she knocked faintly before letting herself into the darkened dorm room the curtains were pulled on all the beds maybe he was asleep padding silently she went to his bed and peeked in she just wanted to see that he was all right lily didntknow who was more surprised when she looked in and he was lying there wide awake his eyes snapped from the drapes overhead and he started at the sight of her i sorry i knocked and i thought you were asleep she gushed in quiet whispers i only wanted to see that you were okay she added awkwardly that all right i sorry i didnthear you he sat up and held a hand out to her i guess i was just out of it for a moment lily stepped out of her slippers before taking his hand and climbing onto the bed and sat in front of him the heavy curtain dropped back into place as if sealing them away from the rest of the sleeping school your hands are cold he said and he shuffled aside so that there was room beside him without so much as a second thought lily crawled over and slid under the thick duvet and he tucked it up over shoulders lily snuggled down and it was the most natural thing in the world for him to put his arms around her she fit against him like she was his complementary mould your hands are still cold he said after a while in answer she tucked her fingers down the collar of his t shirt and felt him shudder not for much longer no not much he agreed lily rolled around so that her face rested comfortably on the crook of his neck the hair at the back of his neck was still damp where he hadntdried it properly after a shower she breathed in deeply loving the way he smelt so fresh and how she could smell him under the cleanness it comforted her and somehow made her belly feel funny she felt her face flush and was infinitely glad that it was dark and he couldntsee her face she lay there pressed against him suddenly feeling very awkward and shy and her initial reason for finding him quite forgotten it felt like an age that they lay there acutely away of each other presence at least that how lily felt it was until she felt james breathing slow and then finally deepen into sleep lily gave a little sigh and did her best to stamp down her little secret flash of disappointment before slowly nodding off to a light sleep
