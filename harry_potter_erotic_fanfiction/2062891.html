birthday to you to herself she climbed down the staircase to see the common room before her she looked around and saw her best friends talking among themselves hey harry hey ron she said happily walking to them harry and ron looked up and to hermione surprise they looked nervous er hi hermione ron said casually we were just going down for breakfast then without a word ron and harry left hermione but she said looking hurt as they climbed out of the portrait hole it my birthday feeling hurt and disappointed hermione walked out of the portrait hole wondering if this would be a good birthday she went down the grand staircase and entered the entrance hall afterwards she came inside the great hall and sat down beside harry who were talking about quidditch the beater tryouts are next week ron said excitedly as he ate a piece of bacon i cantwait and the chaser tryouts will be exciting since dean told me that a lot are experienced but that i will have to see hermione gave ron a near glare while he talked they are talk about quidditch and they completely forgot about her birthday let just hope that one of them is good said harry it important my birthday is important hermione thought through gritted teeth hermione ron said as if he saw her just now er how do you feel hermione noticed ron giving a glance to harry a worried glance hermione just glared at ron and she glared at harry feeling more hurt than before she decided to not eat so she left the great hall without a word hermione bit her lower lip as she made her way to the library a lone tear rolled down her cheek i cantbelieve that my best friends forgot about my birthday after all i ve done for them i never missed their birthdays she covered her mouth to stop herself from sobbing she looked around if anyone watched that and fortunately no one was there hermione entered the library took out a book and sat down flipping the pages sadly she had no idea what book she was reading hello hermione hermione looked up and saw a girl in a white hood her face concealed it was fiyuna happy birthday fiyuna said giving her a long box rapticon sr and i bought it i hope you like it hermione took the box and opened it it was a golden quill a brilliant one to be exact hermione closed it and smiled at fiyuna what did harry got you for your birthday fiyuna asked hermione frowned and shook her head he didntgive you anything hermione nodded and was surprise to see fiyuna smirking under her hood i see anyway i better be going now said fiyuna happy birthday just like the ordinary teenager one would not leave their birthday without a greeting from their friends hermione received birthday cards from family but none from harry or ron all she wanted was a greeting hermione is that you hermione who was covering her face since she was crying looked up and saw her defense against the dark arts professor rapticon sr looking down what are you doing there he bent down at her small figure crying behind a suit of armor isnta place for the birthday girl to cry hermione sniffed and smiled she climbed out from behind the suit of armor wiped her tears away and fixed herself before looking up at rapticon sr why are you crying he asked with concern today your birthday and here i see you crying your eyes of behind some piece of metal hermione noticed the suit of armor helmet looked at rapticon sr hey said rapticon sr pointing a finger at the suit of armor i dontwant to fight with you the armor went back to its normal lifeless state anyway rapticon sr said i just saying that today is your birthday and with you crying i know something wrong um unless there is something wrong hermione bit her lower lip and nodded let me guess harry and ron forgot your birthday hermione nodded again my tip is keep waiting said rapticon sr smirking which is the same smirk fiyuna gave hermione back at the library after drowning not literally on tea with rapticon sr hermione went back to the common room after climbing the portrait hole she saw harry ron and ginny talking in their favorite seats hermione sighed and sat with them hi hermione ginny said hermione noticed ginny looked at harry alarmingly er dontyou have to study for a big test ron asked gingerly hermione felt offended at this so she shook her head slowly and hard defiantly i see and er do you have elf hats to knit ron asked quickly feeling so hurt and angry at them for forgetting the most important day of her life hermione stood up and ran up to the girl dormitory bursting into tears happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to me this song played in hermione head repeatedly as she cried in the most secluded spot in the library missing your birthday is not bad but forgetting it is hermione sniffed and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief while wiping her eyes she felt someone hand hold hers she pulled the handkerchief away to see harry smiling at her warmly i knew you d be here how many times i would catch you here crying when something bad happens said harry hermione threw daggers at him but was grateful that harry came here what are you doing here she asked sternly i thought you ve got some important things to attend to than she paused me what are you talking about harry asked y you forgot my birthday hermione said loudly standing up glaring at harry no i haven t harry said calmly hermione felt insulted he was still smiling oh yes you did hermione said you didntgive me a greeting a gift a cake or any of those because of you and ron this is my worst birthday ever hermione walked to the corner and started crying she felt harry hand held her shoulder hermione like i said before i never forgot your birthday hermione turned and saw harry smiling at her follow me i ve got something to show you hermione followed harry to another place of the library which turned out to be where she usually studies hermione gasped when she saw a delicious looking cake on top of a table surrounded by books parchment paper quills and other school materials it took me an hour to ask madam pince to have your cake here harry said smirking i added the school materials to match your personality and for the first time in a long time hermione smiled at harry you did this for me i wasntalone though said harry nodding to a direction cue to this ron ginny and some gryffindors came out behind bookshelves beaming at hermione the original plan was to put in the common room but since i saw you burst into tears back there i had to make changes said harry it may not be the best but there you go hermione walked closer to the cake and beamed at all of the people around her er thank you actually harry planned it all dean said he came to us last week and asked us to prepare for your birthday hermione turned to harry who was looking at her gingerly oh ginny said happy birthday she added happily as the others followed hermione smiled and looked at her birthday cake it was chocolate her favorite flavor blow and make a wish hermione ron said hermione nodded she closed her eyes and made a wish i wish good things will happen to me i mean i hope good things will happen to my friends and family she opened her eyes and blew the candles as the gryffindors applauded after eating the cake and cleaning up everyone left except for harry who was picking up the school materials which was his hermione was still there watching him clean er thanks again for what you did she said gingerly as harry picked up some parchment and placed it inside a bag no problem harry said anything for my best friend hermione smiled and looked at the bracelet ginny gave her a while ago oh yeah harry said who was looking at hermione the whole time i forgot my birthday present hermione looked up and saw harry walk up to her and planted a kiss on her cheek hermione bit her lower lip stunned she started blushing like it harry asked hermione nodded still biting her lower lip and blushing you re so cute when you look nervous said harry as he hoisted the bag up and left the library with a blushing hermione following at his wake this is dedicated to one of the h hr debates of our time the book moments xi ask ron and ginny instead of going through the hot saturday harry ron and ginny decided to stay under the refuge of the common room harry and ron were playing wizard chess while ginny watched just get it it just a pawn said harry to his knight who seemed hesitant harry then heard ron make a couching noise harry looked up to see ron giving a sly grin which meant to harry that he might be making a wrong move er i think i ll reconsider said harry which made his knight relax harry looked around the board and halfheartedly ordered his bishop to move close to the middle of the board but checkmate said ron harry sighed in defeat ron was always the winner want another round ron asked as ginny clapped happily sure said harry so i can slap that smirk off your face oho getting intimidated eh ron teased no said harry irritably yes you are said ginny playfully no i not said harry then he sighed yes yes i am boy i sound like hermione already speaking of hermione said ron seriously fixing the chess pieces i saw you two yesterday in the lake under the usual tree we stay at what were you two doing talking why said harry now looking at ron who had a small grin were you really talking said ginny teasingly yeah said harry a bit defensively of course we were talking what do we think we should be doing snogging said ginny before bursting into a fit of giggles hey harry said loudly she my best friend i dontthink of her that way and if you believe what rita skeeter said about me and hermione during our fourth year then i sorry to say this but hermione and i have not a thing for each other mind you but how about when she kissed you back in the end of fourth year ron asked of course i remember she kissed me on the cheek so what that means she comfortable being with me but still said ron making the first move of the chess game i think she likes you she a gryffindor and gryffindors are brave she probably used up her courage to do that you think to much said harry knight to c 6 here is one thing to prove to you that i love hermione as a friend ah said ginny you said love she added in a singsong voice ron one harry zero as i was saying said harry glaring at ginny here is proof that i only like hermione as a friend fire away said ron pawn to a 5 when she hugged me back in second year what about it she hugged me without any sign of nervousness and mind you you two didnthug because you two sensed something back there right harry thought he struck gold because ron was making a coughing noise harry hermione likes you and i think she likes you a lot she told me about her encounter with grawp and she slipped that you took her behind a tree to protect her from grawp hand i think you enjoyed that eh said ron smirking i i didn t of course she was in trouble i had to grab her out of harm way but she noted that you were hugging her tightly said ron pointedly it your turn pawn to c 3 actually she was the one hugging me tightly then that settles it said ron hermione might like you and not the other way around harry snorted hermione doesntlike me not as a more than a friend kind of way i think she does said ginny rubbing her chin thoughtfully i remembered during third year when you fell fifty feet from the sky during your match against hufflepuff hermione was nearly falling apart when she saw you falling down falling apart harry asked you know crying said ginny yeah i saw her her hands were over her face and i saw her peeking through her fingers then i saw it she was crying very hard really said harry almost concerned ginny nodded it was authentic she cried on ron shoulder before you hit the ground which you did not i still feel the wetness on my shoulder said ron smirking b but hermione was probably very worried i might die how about during the yule ball ron said what about it ginny told me your face when you saw hermione with viktor krum it as if you were shocked to see hermione you know pretty are you saying that i think hermione ugly said harry rather defensively no said ron and ginny then what are you trying to get to er did you realize she was a you know a girl of course hermione a girl ever since no harry said ginny ron meant that she is someone you can have feelings for ginny i donthave feelings for hermione want proof said ginny firmly well neville told me about hermione incident in the department of mysteries and he told me every detail on how you felt when she fell he said you thought she was dead for your information said harry if it was you or ron i would do the same thing but were we there said ginny n no but neville was what happened when he was in trouble i i didntmind because i was minding hermione safety there you go said ron his voice sounding like a game show host see you have these feelings for her that you are afraid to realize i don t come on said ron irritably fine if you dontlike hermione that way then maybe hermione might like you but i told you she harry said ginny slightly irritated by his stubbornness when you had this one chance to show cho you liked her what did you do er impress her said harry as if this was the most obvious thing to do no said ginny hermione told me she saw you going to get occlumency lessons with snape and you bumped into cho according to hermione your conversation lead to an argument about when marietta cho friend sold us out then cho started calling hermione jinx spell mean and rude or something like that but the point is that that was the right time for you to agree with cho since cho thinks you and hermione are together but i not and how can you prove wait i not done yet anyway what did you do instead of agreeing cho that hermione jinx spell is what she says it is you openly say that hermione was brilliant and you somehow hated cho for giving a go at hermione see now see how you like hermione above all girls believe men hermione told me everything and she was quite touched when you said that she added smiling is this all concrete fact harry asked seriously it not fact harry its truth said ron nodding thoughtfully but harry we had our say and i doubt you cantdebate that said ginny hermione likes you i can tell you two had your moments and i shocked to know that you two never had a thing for each other did hermione tell anything to you ron asked you re like girlfriends no said ginny she so caught up in her studies she has no time to tell me her secrets wait said harry before we can get on with our lives tell me give me one more thing that shows that me and hermione have a thing for each other you can communicate without words said ron oh yeah that too said ginny realizing it you two are like the dynamic duo in plots and schemes remember when you two used the time turner yeah you were like said ron brains and brawn or said ginny looking a bit excited jam and bread alright said harry i dontknow if i hungry or in love what did you say ron and ginny said in unison harry then realized what he said i i didntmean to say it th that way and you know me when you just said it ginny said pointing at him ha we just stumped you ron harry said angrily i didntmean it that way take it easy harry said ginny it was just surprising for you to say that i sorry look harry all we saying is facts we are not matchmakers or anything we just want to show you that hermione or you might like each other more than a friend we didntmean to hurt or upset you hermione a nice person and maybe if you talk to her you might get something out said ron thoughtfully harry looked at ron with understanding and nodded he stood up and started walking to the portrait hole where are you going we have a chess game to play said ron i quit and i need some time to think said harry then her looked at ginny and said oh yeah ginny you can make a great lawyer when harry turned on his heel and heard ron asking what a lawyer is and heard ginny talking about the wizengamot harry walked down the grand staircase he wanted to go to the lake to think but on his way he met someone walking across the same corridor as he is harry saw her biting her fingernails while reading a book hermione looked up and saw harry who smiled she walked up to him and said there you are harry she said look i know that you say i smart and all but i need your help with some defense against the dark arts reference and i know you are the best in that subject in our year and then harry pulled hermione to a very tight hug harry hugged for some seconds and planted a big kiss on her cheek when they pulled away harry saw hermione looking shocked and red all over she was touching the part where harry kissed her and her book was hanging on the grasp of hermione other hand h harry she said embarrassed what was that for harry smirked and continued walking saying to her as he passed her ask ron and ginny then harry left for the entrance hall and with one look behind him he saw hermione smiling to herself as if she wanted harry to do that ask ron and ginny alright harry thought i gonna have a lot of explaining to do when i get back to the common room an alternate scene from quaffles anyone that i deliberately removed but what you see here is not the original draft i remade it the plot in this story was never in the old draft but it was hinted i removed it from qa because the other storyline you see in my other story was better or otherwise quaffles anyone will be rated pg 13 by the way if haventread quaffles anyone then just find the story somewhere in this site fluff level 5 10 xii i have a problem harry knew it from the beginning hermione was getting stressed out from studying and the countless times he said this to her she would always say she fine and that she has not being all that stressed that however was half truth and half lie this little incident has struck harry in the heart and in the mind very seriously and emotionally at the same time he didntwant to see it heck he never knew it and didntsee it coming that day on harry never felt the same well only slight though where hermione ron asked during a late friday afternoon in the great hall for late afternoon snack i dontknow but i think she studying said harry frowning she studying too much again isntshe ron said worriedly did you see her eyes he shuddered she looks like someone who hasnthad any sleep for months i just hope the relaxation method she told me about is working said harry relaxation method ron asked i dunno i think she stays at a quiet place somewhere in hogwarts doing nothing but rest but i dontactually see visual results her eyes still have those shadows he sighed but she told me it is very effective and she quite enjoying it i think it somewhere far ron suggested she probably used her broom harry shrugged hermione could stay at a far place from hogwarts her quidditch ability was such a shock to him she was a natural player and probably flying to a peaceful place was anything but stressing do you think professor raptor gets any stress ron asked looking at the high table harry looks up to see rapticon sr talking animatedly with figment and elvis i doubt he does said harry looking at his wristwatch are you done eating nope said ron taking another sandwich well i done and i think i ll check if hermione in the common room i need her help on an essay see ya harry walked out of the great hall and went up to the grand staircase he went to the common room to find hermione not there feeling a bit worried harry leaves the common room and goes to the library only to find madam pince there excuse me said harry walking to her desk is hermione here though madam pince stern look pronounced her attitude she very patient with the student body no mr potter i haventseen ms granger she said harry thanked her and left the library for the lake and didntfind hermione there where is she harry said mopping his brow as he saw malfoy passing by a few yards from him and as always malfoy never missed sneering at him and walking away harry walked inside the castle and retraced his steps only to find madam pince raising an eyebrow at him when he reentered the library sorry mr potter but ms granger didntcome here and i ll inform you if she has even though going to the lake would not be good enough harry found himself in the top floor corridor where the astronomy tower lay harry then remembered just months ago he and hermione shared their thoughts to each other in that tower and this is also the same place he asked hermione to the christmas ball this could be a good place for her to loosen up a bit harry climbed up the stairwell that lead to the astronomy tower when he reached the door harry placed an ear to the door and only heard silence without hesitation harry opened the door slowly and saw the ramparts of the astronomy tower harry walked forward to the edge and enjoyed the spring breeze then harry felt someone was in the area so he turned his head and saw with his own eyes the most shocking sight he has ever seen he never had any thought of it he never had liked to see it and he never saw it coming how stupid he could get they were teenagers and these things could happen but never in harry life would he see such a thing just a few feet away from him was hermione her back to him showing no sign that she knows of harry presence and to harry shock and bemusement she was doing the one thing she would least do in a regular basis she was smoking a cigarette hermione harry roared in anger hermione jumped and was horrified to see harry harry saw her do her saddest attempt to hide the cigarette by stuffing it in her jeans pocket but she yelped when it burned her h hey harry hermione said nervously w what are you doing here harry felt his face fuming he thought hermione was a goody two shoes and she doing something harry would never even dreamed of this said harry angrily walking up to her is your relaxation method he nearly shouted at her face harry she said scared and calmly i can explain there is no need to explain harry bellowed making hermione jump in fright i caught you red handed hermione i cantbelieve you of all people i thought you harry hermione shouted back tears falling down her face i sorry i sorry i i didntmean to oh yeah and i can clearly see you didnt mean it harry spat back how long have you ve been doing doing this he pointed at her pocket which looked a bit scorched hermione looked down and started giving him nervous glances then she said in a small voice a month a month harry said in bewilderment you ve been hiding from us and smoking for a month actually it less than a month hermione pointed out nervously but that doesnt change everything said harry seriously what were you thinking i just said hermione biting her lower lip have a problem that all a problem said harry still fuming if you have a problem then go to me and ron dontyou think we care about you hermione ron and i will protect you no matter what we will never get you to harm way and if you think mr smokey joe company is better than ours then i suggest hermione cut him off as she broke into a sob i i sorry harry she wailed covering her face you re right i should have sought your help than smoke i really really sorry harry please forgive me harry face softens seeing hermione looking terrible crying helpless and lost harry gives her a sympathetic look and surprises her when he embraces her there there said harry kindly patting her back dontcry i didntmean to get angry at you i was just worried and shocked that you are doing this and the hermione i know thinks twice before she gets to this level i sorry i shouted at you hermione sniffed i i sorry too harry she said i i promise i ll quit it quite easy and by tomorrow you ll see the real hermione she pulled away from him so they were a meter away from each other but before we leave said harry i want you to give me the cigarettes you have harry opens his hands and gave hermione a stern look she sighs and takes out a cigarette pack from her pocket and gives it to harry the one from your pocket said harry nodding to her jeans hermione takes it out slowly and gives him the extinguished death stick harry noticed she looked remorseful ahem hermione said harry pointing to the back of his ear hermione takes a deep breath and takes the cigarette which was resting behind her ear and gives it to harry and i think there is one more said harry making sure he got everything hermione opens the collar of her sweater and reaches in to take another cigarette out and gives it to harry there said hermione looking at the cigarettes and harry saw a faint look of regret in her eyes that all harry takes his wands out points at them and says incendio he said as the cigarettes burned into a crisp harry tosses them into the ground and looks at hermione who was looking at them as if she lost her favorite book you ll get over with it hermione dontworry said harry encouragingly hermione looks at him and nods harry opens the door as hermione walks through it as she passes harry smells her if she smells like a cigarette but the smell of nicotine and lilies entered his nose making him wonder if the lily smell was shampoo harry never told anyone what he saw and hermione was grateful harry was glad she quitted but what bothered him was what hermione problem which leads to her addiction was i told you its studies she said when harry asked but he noticed her looking at him like never before she was slightly blushing the days rolled on and something happened that made harry go bonkers hermione said harry when he spotted her walking out of the common room at the dead of night what are you doing hermione jumped and saw harry at the dark corner of the common room i i was just looking for a er what are you doing up she asked quickly i was studying said harry standing up and walking to her what were you doing i i was just going to the library she said hermione the library is closed at this time at night and dontmake any excuse what do you have in your pocket harry bore into her eyes and then he noticed he was looking at her too much she was looking very uncomfortable my wand she said in an instant and that it she said quickly can i go now no said harry holding her wrist and reaching for the pockets of her robes his eyes still at hermione harry blinked slowly when he felt a rectangular object at his palms he took it out and saw cigarette pack and without controlling himself harry pulled hermione wrist tossing her to the couch he held up the cigarette pack and said in voice that showed he was about to explode i though you promised he said shaking in anger i trusted you hermione that was for professor raptor yeah that was for professor raptor she said nice try hermione professor raptor doesntsmoke and he would probably play russian roulette with you if you woke him up at this time he moved closer to her and took out a cigarette and threw it to the fireplace making it shrivel at the fire since when did you broke your promise he said seriously just yesterday said hermione quietly harry was kind of suspicious by her honesty you re lying said harry no i not she said looking at harry then if you are not lying then why were smoking again at this time hermione gave him a nervous look and bit her lower lip i sorry harry but that one thing i canttell you tell me said harry angrily you can tell this he gestured the cigarette pack your problems but you canttell me if that what you think then do me a favor and get out of my life alright she said standing up i will tell you go ahead said harry throwing the pack into the fire i waiting hermione took a nervous deep breath and said the reason why i you know doing that is because she blinked i have this problem you see what kind of problem said harry crossing his arms i ll get to that hermione said turning a bit red anyway this problem of mine has grown throughout the months after christmas the problem had a huge impact to me the problem had something to do with you harry she finished blushing furiously can i stop there no we finish this tonight why was i involved erm actually she said fiddling with her hands ever since you ve been seeing you know felicity from ravenclaw lately i kind of had this emotion she started rocking backwards and forward slowly i was er angry and sad that you are seeing this person and i was being shunned in the background so i took my mind away from it by doing something that could make me she looked at him guiltily less angry and sad were you jealous harry asked his anger melting away hermione closed her eyes for a long time and opened them again yes i was harry she said firmly i was jealous that you were seeing her instead of me since i had feelings for you harry mouth dropped when hermione started biting her knuckles uncontrollably i just slipped that out wrongly she said quietly looking at the floor y you have feelings for me he said in shock yes she said obviously i was very jealous that you liked her more than me and my feelings for you made me well up with studies and my feelings for you in my head i had to loosen up so that lead me to my addiction but believe me harry i really never meant to smoke i was just confused i sorry harry she was blushing than ever and if you dontfeel the same way like me then i understand but i just want to say is that there is no other person i ever felt about than you harry harry looked at his best friend with sympathy hermione was smoking because she was in feel of affection for him i think i ll never get over with anything so i think it best to not be friends with me anymore hermione said sadly tears falling down i horrible harry saw hermione sitting down on the couch crying i will never be the girl you want harry she said covering her face i not pretty i not funny i donthave the zest to be a dream girl i just a bookworm harry sat beside her and held her shoulder which made her shudder hermione you are not pretty you are beautiful you ve always been and anyone with eyes can see that hermione looked at him but i not like felicity felicity is nice and all but she is nothing compared to you hermione you shocked me back at the christmas ball and i realized that the girl i wanted is right in front of me harry smiled at her and held her shoulders he leaned forward and gave her a very deep and passionate kiss which lasted for eternity harry pulled away and looked at her sorry to break the moment said harry but you need to brush your teeth hermione giggled and blushed a bit i will harry and that isnta lie i promise she said harry smiled and they both hugged till the time passed ah elvis woke up in a start and he woke up figment up figment figment wake up i had a dream he said in hush voice prodding him awake wow a dream figment said irritably that proves you have a brain i impressed he snorted go to sleep no it was very important elvis said hermione was smoking cancer sticks and her addiction lead to harry kissing her he beamed isntthat great yeah and i just dreamt i was standing over your grave sleep or that dream might become reality without hesitation elvis climbed into his own bed and slept hoping everything he dreamt wasnttrue in fact it wasnttrue just a dream elvis and figment are original characters from quaffles anyone and if you want to know more about the duo then read it weasley tales to put it simply are short stories that revolve the romance of harry and hermione in a weasley point of view expect more of weasley tales in the future starring other weasleys of the weasley clan the first weasley tales stars our very own ron weasley enjoy xiv weasley tales i something afoot starring ron weasley something afoot ron can tell he seen the closeness the talking the eye gazing and the holding he has evidence but he needs the most solid concrete on the spot evidence to prove that he is right and his obsession to find the evidence was too much for his own good the whole fiasco began on the night of wednesday before the christmas holidays it was a very cold night and we see ron warming himself up near the fire in the common room ah nothing beats a good night with the fireplace lit up and me worrying about nothing but prefect duties ron sighed as he relaxed in front of the couch ron looked around the common room to see harry writing down his essay for transfiguration somehow ron felt good that he finished his two days ago ron turned his head to see hermione studying as always for a test on arithmancy strange how she can keep up with those kinds of subjects ron thought it was when the grandfather clock started to chime ron realized it was time for him to sleep well guys i off to bed harry are you coming ron asked his friend harry looked up and smiled no thanks ron i still have a foot left in my parchment i ll catch up with you as soon as i done ron nodded in reply and it was this very moment that hermione said i going to bed too she stood up and started fixing her things ok ron said have a good sleep hermione smiled at him as she placed her books into her bag good night guys ron yawned as he was walking to the spiral staircase ron wait it was harry ron looked at him and saw harry fixing his stuff i going to bed too how about your essay that due tomorrow ron said er i done harry nodded yeah that right i done ron raised his eyebrow i thought you had a foot left in your parchment i er did a fast job really ron said impressively first you are one of the fastest seekers in the school and now you are the fastest essay writer in the common room what next he joked can i take a look nah it kind of wordy and i know it not your type harry assumed as he kept his books and parchment in his bag oh ron said perplexedly well i ll go on ahead g night ron climbed upstairs wondering how harry writes his essay that fast ron woke up on saturday morning he rubbed his eyes and smirked at the sight of the snow falling outside of the tower window the holidays look harry he said it snowing harry ron turned and saw that harry bed was empty oh looks like he went down earlier without difficulty ron dressed himself and went down to the common room to see if harry and hermione were there they were there but how they were there made ron a bit surprised sitting between a small table harry and hermione were laughing among themselves this would look casual to others but to a friend who has known them for six years now it was different firstly the way hermione was looking at harry while harry talked she was giving toothless grin while her elbow was on the table and her head leaning on her hand while her other arm was outstretched on the table with her hand holding harry elbow ron didntfeel jealous but he had this gut feeling about the sight er good morning guys he called approaching to them good morning ron harry replied turning to ron you know i couldnt sleep last night you were snoring really loud ron felt a bit taken aback at the comment b but i just drank my potion yo you saw me two nights remember you said so yourself ron drink you potion i dontwant another chorus line tonight and you ron stopped because he noticed hermione stifled giggles he looked at harry who was sporting a small grin wait a minute ron said looking a bit stupid and realizing what going on you re kidding me right at this hermione and harry were laughing of course we are hermione said grabbing ron hands donttake it offensively ron harry just told me how paranoid you are to get your snoring problem fixed the heat in ron face ebbed away as he made a small grin i see er anyway what were you two talking about we were just talking about the holidays and what present we hope to receive this christmas harry replied really ron smiled you know i always wanted a weasley sweater that is not maroon he said the last word with emphasis we know ron hermione nodded standing up we better go down for breakfast yeah harry stood up as the three left the portrait hole and maybe we can go to library and research on snape holiday essay you re kidding me right hermione asked as they went down the grand staircase no said harry then gave a wink to ron but ron gave a furtive look to hermione which she noticed you re teasing me are you hermione punched lightly on harry shoulder hey harry rubbed his shoulder donthit me he pushed hermione playfully you gave a go at me first hermione ruffled his hair well you hey hey ron cut them off alarmingly hello what in merlin name are you doing harry and hermione looked at each other you re right said harry we forgot to ask ron if he wants to go to the library with us you know how he hates it there harry and hermione were smiling at ron wait wait ron spoke loudly making them stop at the middle of a staircase can you tell me why are acting like this since when do you go all teasingish hermione ron asked what ron it just that it the holidays i just happy that all hermione replied but ron gave her an indignation look so she added quickly but if it makes you feel better then here she took something out of her pocket took a step forward so she was close to harry who was between them and gave ron a chocolate frog thanks said ron but before he could eat his frog he realized how close hermione was to harry when she moved forward to give him the chocolate frog what harry asked who looked totally unaware that hermione was very close to him at his side ron snapped out of his reverie nothing it just that er never mind he ripped the chocolate frog wrapper and ate it in a full bite let go shall we then they all went down to the great hall for breakfast while ron forgot about how personal space isntan issue to harry or hermione something afoot ron thought but he let that go easily the next two days were peculiar to ron for one thing he keeps on seeing hermione and harry talking more often and a part of him felt left out that he wasntin the conversations that much some things were unexplainable like when hermione was about to leave the common room harry stood from his chair and started asking hermione to get him something from the library the new edition of quidditch though the ages ron didntmind at first but the way he asked was a bit childish pleeaase hermione he pleaded holding his hand together like in a praying position ron looked up and saw hermione replying saying that she would get it and she ruffled his hair before she left the next thing he knew harry was sitting on the couch beside him making a not so furtive satisfied look it wasntjust that being the only gryffindors in the school mcgonagall asked ron harry and hermione if they can decorate the common room while decorating harry commented on the garland frame hermione made on the window sill wow hermione it beautiful what harry did you just i beautiful hermione replied looking at harry raising her eyebrows with a smirk it was getting too obvious that there is something going between the two when harry answered that he wasntreferring to her they went back to what they were doing and to ron surprise harry smiled to hermione and when harry looked away hermione did the same thing alright they re in love canthide it from the guy who experienced it in the first place hey harry said hermione taking a slice out of the baked alaska during dinner on christmas eve taste this it great ron looked at them and saw hermione feeding harry a slice of baked alaska though this seems what brides and grooms do at weddings ron remembered they werentin a wedding he seemed a bit hurt that harry and hermione are not telling that they are something more than just friends something is afoot and it driving ron crazy more events like these happen hermione stumbling while they were walking and harry catches her harry and hermione talking often hermione being sweet to harry harry charming her harry and hermione this harry and hermione that harry hermione harry hermione harry hermione harry hermione harry and hermione ron ron woke up with a start and saw harry giving him a parchment paper ron took it and saw that he was in the common room and it was nighttime and christmas day has passed mcgonagall forgot to give out our essays harry spoke sitting beside him on the couch hey it was hermione with the same essay that mcgonagall gave out she sat down beside ron so now he was between the two of them ron looked left and right is it true that these two are something more he needs to experiment um hey hermione ron asked leaning toward her do you ever thought of joining the er quidditch team hermione looked at him peculiarly me quidditch ha that a story no i dontthink i interested in it and besides i not cut out for quidditch i see ron nodded thoughtfully i ll get back to you later ron leaned to harry side where harry was looking at this paper harry can i ask you a question harry looked at ron sure ron anything what is it ron took a deep breath and asked what kind of girl do you want to have harry shifted on his seat uncomfortably sorry what he asked i said what kind of girl do you like to have harry looked up thoughtfully and answered well i like a girl who is smart funny pretty considerate confident and loyal and i have to admit a bit shy okay see you later ron said leaning towards hermione side before harry could continue hermione can i ask you a rather personal question looking a bit taken aback at the sudden comment hermione nodded slowly sure ron but that depends dont worry it nothing personal anyway my question do you think some boys feel that they are superior to girls hermione nodded attentively wow ron that rather er personal i dontboys feel that way i ve never seen a boy being a sexist or anything then can you tell me who these people who are not anti girls are there is you and harry but i have to admit you can be a bit of a sexist at times ron looked at her wide eyed what about harry hermione looked thoughtfully at ron well harry is a gentleman he knows how to make every girl comfortable as possible except when he angry of course oh ron thought looks like i getting somewhere why d you ask nothing ron said shaking his head er i ll be back with you in a second he leaned towards harry harry brown or blue er brown harry answered halfheartedly thank you ron nodded and leaned to hermione hermione black or red hermione gave him a puzzled look but she answered red damn ron thought well red is for gryffindor and harry a gryffindor so there you have it okay he went back for harry harry short or tall short harry answered good ron went to hermione hermione green or pink green she said ron why are you asking me this yeah ron harry said who was also keen into knowing what was going on what is going on and why are you asking us questions what is going on with me ron said irritably standing up and looking at both of them the question is what is going on with the two of you he pointed at the two of them i know something is going on and you even had the guts to not tell me ha the joke is on you there are things that i know that you know about the things you know you know yeah that right something is afoot here and if you dontgive a damn about whoa whoa whoa ron calm down harry said reaching a placate hand to ron i didntget what you were saying you re speaking so fast yes ron hermione said in concern is there something bothering you talk to us we ll understand ron looked at the two of them and sighed never mind he looked at the floor sorry i shouted at the two of you you just dontget it get what harry asked nothing ron waved his hands impatiently i just er frustrated today i had dream that my dad was a man in black armor last night there was silence for a while and hermione said after clearing her throat er darth vader she asked looking a bit puzzled who he ron asked never mind hermione said rolling her eyes look are you sure you re going be okay yeah yeah said ron combing his hair with his hand sorry about the sudden outburst it okay ron said harry smiling at him just calm down and relax hermione nodded okay ron turned around and shouted hiya as he flailed his arms like he was doing karate feeling a bit better doing that ron turned to harry and hermione surprised faces hermione was covering her mouth which hid a giggle er that was karate ron said his cheeks turning a slight shade of magenta fred and george are learning it right now you know this stuff since you live with muggles you should know it oh hermione and harry said in unison feeling a bit embarrassed of himself ron rushed to his dormitory a week has passed since the night he yelled at harry and hermione and hogwarts started to become bustling with activity now that the holidays are over the starting of a new year seems to put to an effect to ron he was a bit attentive during transfiguration class and earned five points for turning his table into pig perfectly quidditch training was great as usual and the food just tasted better ron was such in a good mood he totally forgot about his harry and hermione problem that was before saturday though a trip to hogsmeade was scheduled this saturday ron harry and hermione were talking about going there at the lake during lunch but hermione said she not coming due to studies ron was expecting harry to stay but really well ron and i will just bring back some honeyduke sweets for you what harry said made ron eye them suspiciously saturday came with a nice post christmas breeze and the great hall was buzzing with talk about the hogsmeade trip ron was eating his sausages and eggs happily while neville dean and seamus were talking about getting some stuff at zonko joke shop ron looked across the table and saw harry and hermione seated side by side talking about n e w t s i telling you harry you and ron are going to flop if you dontstudy now n e w t s are a high priority these days parvati and lavender were doing there talking about visiting madam puddifoot for any pastries while ginny was eating alone beside ron breakfast ended and students started leaving the great hall for entrance hall for roll call by argus filch before they set off to hogsmeade everyone in the gryffindor table was about leave when looks like we are leaving said harry standing up see you later hermione then in one moment harry bent down to kiss hermione on the lips making everyone near them freeze with there mouths open ron looked in shock as harry and hermione lips parted ron caught a nervous look in harry eyes as he turned to look at everyone nervously of course said harry briskly i wouldntforget about you parvati harry walked to parvati and kissed her on the lips like hermione ron goggled at the sight what in bloody hell after kissing parvati harry kissed lavender across the table and after kissing her oh yes he smack his forehead i forgot about young little ginny being the big brother of ginny ron didntmind when harry kissed her it was just that since when did harry start kissing everyone after the kiss harry looked around and neville said dont kiss me and he rushed to the entrance hall and without further ado harry walked out of the great hall silently leaving an impression that will last for a lifetime alright ginny spoke after a long silence what was that she asked hermione firmly while lavender and parvati giggled heavily in the background ron also wanted to ask the same question i dontknow hermione spoke with a high voice which was usually saved for tense moments something he found in a er a book yes that right harry must ve read something about kissing girls before leaving a room on a saturday morning ginny interrupted okay this is harry we are talking about since when does harry do that i dontknow hermione replied shrugging er i going to the library and with that hermione left the great hall ron ginny asked do you know something about this if i d know then i would be kissing hermione instead ron answered with sarcasm nothing particular happened after the hogsmeade weekend harry told ron he d be in three broomsticks while ron checked out honeyduke s ron left the sweetshop carrying a bag filled with sweets and his moneybag lighter than usual it was kind of strange but half an hour has ron been waiting for harry but the meat pies that the three broomsticks served kept his mind out of worry harry came back holding a bag with the scrivenshaft logo on it what took you ron asked the line in scrivenshaft was so murderous that i only got one item and that i didntgo here earlier than i expected ron nodded as he took another bite of his pie hey guess what harry lowered his head and whispered i saw snape exiting out of the hog head carrying a bottle of firewhisky ron sniggered really no wonder he seemed leggy during double potions this week they both laughed and after a few minutes of filling their mouths with meat pies and sundaes they left sunday came the next day and during the afternoon ron harry and hermione stayed inside the warmth of the gryffindor tower ron was playing wizard chess with neville while harry stared into the window looking deep in thought hermione and ginny were reading books at the other side of the common room pawn to e 3 wow neville you are improving really fast neville smirked as he scratched his nose thanks ron knight to g 4 i ve been reading this book my uncle gave me i thought it wasntinteresting but from the moment i read the first page i couldntput the book down that good ron smirked maybe you can kick harry arse in this game already he lowered his voice but to be honest with you neville harry stinks in this game sometimes neville chuckled speaking of harry neville moved closer to ron i dontknow if you know this but yesterday at hogsmeade i was in scrivenshaft shop looking for a new quill anyway i was about to leave the place when i saw harry coming out behind a shelf looking kind of er a mess i was surprised and i asked him if he was okay but harry said yes and left neville voiced lowered that ron nose was almost touching the tip of his king chess piece trying to listen to him being curious i checked the aisle he was and i saw no one there but i did find this neville took out something in his pocket and it was revealed that it was a green hairclip with a plastic white lily on top ron leaned back and said you found this on the floor ron took it analyzing it i dontknow with you but i think harry is dont finish that sentence neville ron shushed him look i ll just talk to harry queen to 3 d checkmate then ron left leaving neville shocked at his quick defeat ron looked at the green hairclip and walked towards harry who was still looking out the window hey harry ron spoke making him turn what are you doing nothing said harry impassively just looking out the window well neville was talking to me and he said he found you leaving an aisle in scrivenshaft and look what neville found ron shoved the hairclip under harry nose do you do you know who own this ron observed harry face harry was looking at it then he spoke no he sighed i have no idea who owns that hairclip i see ron bobbed his head slightly okay just asking you can have it ron gave harry the hairclip er thanks ron no problem ron sat on the nearest couch and was about to think when he overheard hermione hey ginny she closed her books guess what i saw yesterday at hogsmeade ginny shook her head you want to know well i saw snape coming out of the hog head holding a bottle of firewhisky ginny jaw dropped slightly and giggled wow no wonder ron raised an eyebrow and looked at the hearthrug wasntthat the same thing harry said oh merlin hermione looked into her bag i seem to misplace that hairclip again have you seen it ginny no these words somehow hit ron in the head like a hammer ron eyes widened and looked at harry who was also looking at ron with a shocked face y y y y you h harry ron stammered pointing a shaking finger at him before ron could say something harry grabbed ron by the shoulders and started gagging him while ron started wrestling out of harry grasp ron couldntsee but he was amazed how strong harry was harry quidditch trained arms were wrapped around ron head that ron couldntsee anything anymore what are you doing harry ginny voice came ron was trying to shout but he yelped in pain when he felt something jagged below him hit his foot harry was dragging him up to the dormitory ron couldntsee but he was yelling though he knew it will be muffled by harry arms before ron knew it he felt harry tossing the two of them towards something soft harry let go of ron and ron was breathing oh my merlin ron yelled sitting up realizing the soft place he landed was the bed ron didntcare about oxygen it was true all along harry stood up looking panicked and hermione was leaning on the closed door of the dormitory you he pointed to harry who was nodding in defeat and you he pointed to hermione who was fumbling her fingers nervously but nodded as well both of you together harry and hermione were silent ron looked at them in disbelief it was true then but knowing that it is true seems to hard to take there was a long brief silence alright ron hermione spoke first there are some things you have the right of knowing oh yes i have ron yelled standing up making hermione jump for a moment hehe calm down now hermione humored i dontlike your tone anyway er harry you tell him hermione took a step backward as she pushed harry forward okay harry said glaring at hermione before looking at ron ron before i say anything i just want you to know that we were worried about how you ll react to this react to what ron raised an eyebrow hermione and i are er hermione and i are hermione then stepped on harry toe together harry yelped massaging his toe hermione sorry harry look ron hermione walked to him and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder we dontwant this to be a big deal but it is a big deal ron shouted making hermione jump again okay ron i told you to not shout hermione said cautiously but when where how you have to tell me ron asked quickly ron calm down harry said loudly and after a brief paused it happened during the summer back in grimmauld place london in london ron eyes widened as harry and hermione shushed him shhh ron hermione spat we didntwant to tell because we didnt want this to be for us but this is huge ron said his brows furrowing sadly i i have to tell someone about this he started walking towards the door but harry and hermione blocked his way no no no harry shook a finger at ron you canttell anyone hermione and i wanted this to be kept a secret till we are ready to tell ron turned away from them and raked his flaming red hair yes ron ron felt hermione holding his arm this is what we want please donttell anyone ron looked at hermione who was pouting ron sighed and looked at harry alright ron said smiling back at them sorry about a while ago yeah harry said walking forward to ron i sorry i kind of gagged you back there it okay ron calmly held up a forgiving hand to harry if this is important to you then it will be to me thank you ron hermione smiled kissing him on the cheek besides harry and i arentgoofing around hermione walked to harry as harry put his arm around her we are in love with each other ron couldnthelp but smirk at the two i knew that ron waved his hand it was funny that i didnt notice the two of you till christmas ron harry and hermione laughed harry opened the door do you want to visit hagrid harry asked sure ron nodded of course hermione said but i ll just get my jacket first ron cut hermione off by doing something drastic and like a cheetah ron rushed out of the dormitory leaving harry and hermione in confusion wow harry said smirking ron is pretty excited to meet hagrid harry smirk faded away when he saw hermione eyes widened oh harry hermione cried he isntexcited about hagrid he is going to tell hagrid about us and thus harry and hermione chased ron before hell breaks loose ron was very keen and finally found out about the two of them he was okay with the whole thing but his urge to tell someone about harry and hermione would always overwhelm him and that ron a weasley who has courage in his heart and determination in his self and that all for now and hopefully the next thing we would do is pull a weasley more weasley tales coming soon i renamed the fluff collection to the chronciles of h hr fluff i might rename it back just in case the readers that you might not like it or might like the last one harry potter h hr fluff collection a lot better and to answer the readers who ve been asking a while back yes i have been watching friends lately so expect a lot of friends reference in the future enjoy xvi sharing thoughts harry found it strange to travel in the hogwarts express alone he looked out the window watching mountains trees and life pass by thinking deeply harry hasntseen the weasleys back at platform nine and three quarters and before he could double check the area for them the conductor called everyone to board since the train is already leaving harry expected to meet ron and hermione meeting him in the train later where are they harry wondered standing up and sticking his head out of the compartment door looking left and right harry saw nothing except a couple of second years exiting a compartment at the end of the hallway with a sigh harry sat on his seat and watched the clouds out the window half an hour passed and no sign of ron or hermione the lady with the snack cart came by and he bought a lot of snacks for the whole trip it felt weird that he had no one to share it with he was about to unwrap his first chocolate frog when the compartment door slid open harry looked up and saw hermione smiling at him hey she greeted with a sheepish wave hey harry replied smiling were have you been i ve been waiting for you and ron hermione sat down opposite of harry sorry harry but ron and i are prefects and we are doing prefect duties she took one of the pumpkin pasties and ate some ron was worried that you didntcome to the burrow this summer we ve been looking for you back at the platform but we didntsee you i d reckon we will meet you anyway on the train so where ron harry asked he hasntdone his duties yet i done i was going to double check this place then i saw you acting like a young boy with his candies she teased very funny harry smirked i bought a lot just incase you and ron might come here and want som aw hermione looked at harry warmly you are so sweet she took his hands and stroked it with her thumb harry found it a bit awkward that hermione is doing this but it wasntthe first time hermione did these kinds of things hermione has grabbed harry arm hugged him kissed him on the cheek comforted him and held his hands often he smiled seeing how hermione cared for him throughout the years what hermione caught his smile nothing harry looked down i just realized how er how how very nice you look he said quickly oh hermione blushed thank you she said without looking at harry there was complete silence for a few minutes then harry hermione spoke have you ever thought of going into professional quidditch no harry replied and since when do you speak quidditch he smiled at her it just that it er you know it hard to talk to you these days that i afraid that almost every topic might get you to shout at someone that all she bit her lower lip harry laughed dontbe scared hermione i fine i have finally got over my feelings on sirius death he paused for a while and sighed i going to be fine because of you ron and the weasleys i was able to hold on to my sanity thanks he smiled again you re welcome i was very worried you know you seemed like you were about to kill yourself she stood up and sat beside harry at least you re okay already you were always there for me just like i was there for you harry pointed out i know i cantforget the countless times you would grab me from danger hermione stroked his arm well i dontwant my best friend to get hurt you and ron are very important to me i wouldntknow what to do if you two died or something harry didnthear hermione reply but she did hug his arm very tightly harry looked down and saw hermione hugging his arm while looking out the window harry didntknow why but it was very relaxing and nice to see her with him to see how close she was to him it was very comforting time seems to pass the two by ron hasntarrived from prefect duties harry believed that ron was done and he is now staying with ginny wondering where he harry went i wonder what will happen this year hermione said resting her head on harry shoulder i can expect good and bad things it always like that for me harry replied like that for you look at me i ve never had a year were no one would tease or insult me hermione said harry turned to her he noticed hermione looking sad well you seem to take most of them well well harry for the past years i ve always get this feeling of depression when i get insulted by malfoy and his friends please dontcry harry teased i not crying hermione replied although i used to when you and ron were you know she drifted off in the last part of the sentence were what harry looked at her when you two were calling me names behind my back hermione assured him pulling herself away from him so she is seated cross legged on the seat beside harry hermione for the last time i wasntin the name calling stuff oh yes you were if i can recall correctly i remember calling me a nightmare hermione gave harry a serious look that was ron i was just silent i didnthave the heart to call someone names how about malfoy hermione asked malfoy was being mean to me and everyone you in the other hand you were just just innocent you were doing your job as a student so i really never had the heart to insult you or call you names harry was relieved when hermione face didntlook serious anymore to tell you the truth i found you rather cute for a very bookish person harry said usually those types in my school wore glasses had braces freckles and look ugly you really think so hermione titled her head rather adorably yeah harry continued especially at the yule ball i have to admit i nearly fainted it was so unlike you to wear makeup perfume and straight hair i kind of went a bit too far didnti hermione winced a bit no no you were just right ron was shocked the moment he saw you looking like that it was obvious he was jealous hermione grinned i didntknow why but i was a teensy bit happy that ron was jealous you know ron and me always bickering with each other then the next thing bam ron weak in the knees she giggled er what about you harry hermione slowly asked what about me um were you er you know a bit jealous no harry finished the sentence for her but i thought you looked very beautiful you know apart from my family you are the only one who has ever said that i m you know pretty and stuff why didntviktor call you any of those no hermione sighed he was too shy another long silence came to them harry looked at hermione who was rocking back and forth on her seat hey harry hermione swung her feet to the floor so she was seated properly while we are sharing things about us can i ask some advice harry turned to her with a quizzical look what kind of advice harry saw hermione cheeks turn to a light shade of magenta well er no i canttell you she put her hand over her eyes embarrassingly c mon hermione harry urged scooting closer to her you can tell me i ve asked you some advice when i had problems with cho alright alright hermione scratched the back of her head just dontlaugh okay and donttell ron or anyone sure fire away harry took a pepper imp and ate it well hermione started i have this er i have this thing what kind of thing a thing hermione continued just a small thing very small what is it if you keep on asking questions then i wonttell you hermione said sternly sorry harry apologized okay continue anyway this small thing is kind of a little kinda like a thing on someone a crush hermione bit her lower lip and said softly yes she blushed you know lets not talk about this hermione harry grabbed her arm and shook it lightly please i want to help harry looked into her brown eyes with wanting she sighed and smirked fine i have this crush on someone he at hogwarts of course and also he in gryffindor it ron isn t harry speculated no hermione waved her hand impatiently let say i have feelings for him and i very very er very very shy into admitting it to him because because because what because i afraid he might reject me not because he thinks i a you know a nerd or anything he a friend so i alright with that i just need some advice i want to tell him how i feel just to let the feeling out you know i afraid that all harry held hermione shoulder just tell him hermione shot a look at him b but what if he doesntaccept me harry scoffed who wouldntaccept you you re smart pretty and understanding harry knew he was saying too much because hermione looked nervous and very pink right now did i say something wrong harry asked cautiously no no i fine hermione smiled warmly at him thanks your welcome i hope my advice helps because i suck at doing that hermione laughed and harry kissed her on the forehead making her stop i love it when you laugh he said while hermione turned redder than a quaffle it was in harry subconscious that he liked seeing hermione blush embarrassed or act nervous at times er i think hermione stood up nearly stumbling on the threshold of the compartment i think i need to do those prefect duties again um thanks harry for the advice then without a word hermione left the compartment there you are ron called as harry jumped off the train where were you i thought those muggles didntlet you go to school dontworry ron i fine harry said as the voice of hagrid saying firs years dis way was heard from afar hey harry it was ginny hey have you seen hermione yet yeah i did harry nodded you did ginny eyes widened well she told me to give you this she took something out of her robes and gave it to harry it was a gray box what is this hermione hasntgiven you a present for your birthday back at july so she told me to give this to you just incase you went to the burrow harry opened the box and saw a very very surprising gift wow harry gasped it was a golden chain necklace that looked long enough to fit his neck and a small snitch hung at the lace with silver wings i haventseen it yet ginny said but hermione hopped you would like it i love it harry closed it and put it in his robes but why would she get me this expensive this could ve cost her a fortune this time ron answered well you know how percy fell in love with penelope clearwater that he bought her that crystal duck despite the price harry looked at ron with revelation what do you mean harry asked urgently were you comparing percy situation with this he took out the box and showed it to ron of course if you put it that way ron stopped talking and closed his mouth with his hand harry turned to ginny who looked a bit gingerly after looking at both of there anxious faces the thought hit harry head like bludger in the head are you saying hermione bought this for me because she is in no ron shouted pointing at harry alarmingly i didntmean that dontsay it it not true he started hopping madly i didntsay anything no no no no no no ron started rubbing his temples keep rubbing ginny said nastily that will turn back time harry shook his head vigorously so you are saying hermione likes me yes ron and ginny said in unison harry paused hermione liked him what a shocker no wonder she was asking him advice she wanted to know how he would react to the whole thing he just gave hermione a way to his heart wait why is being negative about this this is hermione the person harry complemented as pretty smart and understandable did he say that just to be polite or there was more to it this information reminded the time when mr and mrs weasley said that harry cantgo to hogwarts knowing that sirius black was after him back in his third year harry said ginny harry looked at the red headed girl how long has she been you know since fifth year ron answered she told us the truth by owl two months ago but ginny knew like a long time ago what are you going to do ginny asked i have to talk to her of course harry said she my best friend not that i dontwant her to be my girlfriend it just that it hermione hello so ginny raised her hands to shoulder level what the point the point is that hermione is my best friend you see best friends are not meant for each other c mon harry ron patted his back i had a crush on her once it normal look you know each other so much already you dontneed any weird and awkward conversations just give her a chance harry ginny pleaded harry looked at ron and ginny faces were they serious harry thought about it what good will it do no the question is what bad will it do for him and her nothing nothing will happen harry thought he knew already a lot about hermione ron had a point of awkward conversations hermione was pretty in a way and for the first time in his life he realized how attractive she looked when she smiled and laughed well harry woke from his reverie and turned to ginny and ron who were smirking would you give her a chance ginny asked again harry sighed deeply and nodded really ron said that great you have to tell her tonight though why harry said because you must ginny said as if this was the most obvious thing you have to tell her as soon as possible hey hurry up you guys harry ron and ginny looked up to see hermione calling them with her hands on her hips they noticed the traffic they ve been causing that they started leaving what took you hermione said we were talking some stuff ginny answered as they walked down the path were the carriages carried by thestrals were you ride with hermione alone ron whispered in harry ear harry nodded this was it a carriage stopped by and the doors opened ginny and ron jumped in and before hermione could get in ginny closed the door shouting carriage is full as they were dragged towards the castle what the hermione said quizzically but shrugged as the next one came harry twiddled his thumb as hermione jumped in the carriage harry followed closed the door and they were on the move there was pure silence between the two harry knew this was a great time to tell so without hesitating and using up his gryffindor strength he said hermione hermione turned to harry and raised her eyebrows yeah i have something really really important to tell you he finally said without hesitation what is it hermione asked i think he hesitated a bit i think think what hermione said i think i know who you have a crush on harry said briskly hermione looked at him alarmingly who she asked er neville he lied you like neville do you harry knew it wasntneville because hermione sighed was it a sigh of relief yes harry hermione said harry knew she was lying how did you know that wait harry cut her off i was lying i dontthink it neville then who is it to you hermione winced harry looked in to her chocolate brown eyes for the first time ever in his life he knew it in an instant he wanted to look into them forever ron and ginny were right after all harry knew hermione very well and seeing her eyes makes him think she perfect answering hermione question harry took out the box and showed her the necklace er i think this gift gave it away harry bit his lower lip hermione fell silent and she started blushing furiously yes it was confirmed hermione is indeed in love with harry thus the long trip to hogwarts began harry didntknow what would happen in the future he was unknown of the fact that he and hermione will be having their first date in hogsmeade at halloween getting kisses from hermione during free time and the like he didntknow that but by the looks of things that are happening in the present they could come true author note 1 this is the finale of the first set of fluffs in the collection season 2 of the fluff collection will probably begin as soon as the finale is done there are two parts and i hope by the end of it you ll all feel good inside read btw please review not that i demanding it i just want something new to read when i check the internet please review i d much appreciate it thanks enjoy p s a useless but interesting bit the prophecy is how i think book 6 will go when harry makes a big decision about the prophecy and of course the outcome on how his dearest friends will react to it you ll be pretty surprise how it will happen season 1 finale xvii the prophecy i it has been two weeks since harry arrived at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry it has also been the worst weeks of his life never in his entire life that he would feel so left out and different from his friends it was painful to think it that way he felt like an outcast as if it was playing in his head like a recorder the words of the prophecy played in his mind haunting him it was like a ghost telling you that you ll die anytime soon aside from the prophecy haunting him he also had problems one was when he had dreams about his dead godfather sirius which didntbother him anymore since lupin gave him a very serious talk back in the dining room in grimmauld place harry knew that his friends were waiting outside of the door trying to listen what he and lupin talked about since the moment he left he found ron hermione fred george and ginny lingering outside telling him that they just arrived of course harry didnttell lupin about the prophecy and felt a lot better after the talk the subject on sirius death didntbother him anymore he found himself making small talk with ron about everyday life but didntwant to engage with long conversations harry would just not talk that much anymore it was a thing that he been doing ever since he talked with lupin his dreams about sirius death were just hovering in his mind but what bothered him the most that his friends were very very worried about him he kept finding himself locked up in a cupboard somewhere around grimmauld place while his friends were out looking for him they tried talking to him about his problem harry couldntblame them about intrusion since they were expecting that lupin talk would make him less paranoid but they didntknow that the prophecy was still in harry mind right now though it was still bothering him harry knew that someday he must tell his friends about the prophecy it worried him on how will they react to it that what he hated he didntwant them to think that he will be either a murderer or be murdered which would make him even feel left out that he is having this big decision while the others weren t harry tried to recall the last time they tried to talk to him it was only yesterday that ron and hermione cornered him in the common room last night harry hermione said cautiously i know you arentkeen on talking right now but would you at least tell us what has been bothering you what happened didntlupin talk do you any good harry looked up from his seat and saw both of his two best friends looking anxiously at him it did was the only thing that came out of harry mouth hermione and ron exchanged looks so so why are you still er you know miserable ron asked harry looked at the fireplace why was he feeling so miserable getting over sirius was one of the hardest things he has ever done so why be miserable the prophecy could be flawed but why is he assuming that it isn t what if it was neville who was the chosen one harry didntwant to think that dumbledore already confirmed that it was he harry is the chosen one to defeat voldemort please harry hermione said sitting beside him on the couch he was sitting on talk to us harry looked at hermione he knew in an instant that hermione cared for him the most than any other person he knew aside from mrs weasley would she and ron understand about the prophecy harry was already thinking about what they will say which made him feel bad again harry ron asked harry was silent for a moment and shook his head there is nothing wrong i just tired that all i fine no you re not ron shot back you barely eat what mum cooks you have shadows under your eyes you hardly talk to any of us and hermione noticed you dontpay attention in classes what the point harry spoke feeling a bit affronted by ron sudden statement harry the point is that we want to know why are you so lost hermione spoke taking his hand and stroking it soothingly we want to help harry we ve known you for five years and we know when something is wrong we want to be a part of it harry pulled his hand from hermione and stood up you dontknow how painful it is to be a part of it harry said perplexedly walking towards the dormitory stairs harry please hermione cried we want to help harry turned to see hermione on her feet with tears streaming down her face while ron looked on anxiously hoping that harry would tell them what going on with him harry ron and i will always be with you no matter what hermione said quietly sniffing while she fought back a sob dontleave us in the dark well harry said shaking a bit now you know what it feels like being in the dark and with that he left leaving ron and hermione disappointed ever since then harry hasntspoken to them he wished he hadntsaid those last words to them last night it made him feel like an outcast again since he saw the two this morning in breakfast talking amongst themselves harry looked at his watch to see he was protracted in this deserted classroom for almost two hours now dinner must ve ended harry thought he wasnthungry he seems to lose his appetite back in june fighting the urge to just spend the rest of the night in here harry stood up and went for the common room hoping that he wouldntbe interrogated by his friends again fortunately ron and hermione didnttalk to him about his problem that night they were only doing schoolwork when he walked in and both of them completely ignored him there was a time harry wished they could at least try talking to them so he knew if they cared for him with that in place harry just went up to the dormitory and prayed that tomorrow will be a better day than today the next day came and it was as miserable as yesterday harry didnteven ate his chocolate pudding during breakfast he didntwant to talk with ron and hermione and the worst thing happened in transfiguration before lunch potter harry woke from his reverie and saw mcgonagall sternly looking at him yes harry replied dully can you tell me anything about today lesson harry stood up from his seat and tried to think what mcgonagall was talking about but nothing came out his recent miseries have made him so distracted that he almost forgot that he was still studying since he didntknow anything harry just spoke quietly i do not know ma am mcgonagall made a brisk nod and told harry to sit feeling a bit humiliated harry turned to see ron and hermione acting as if nothing has happened after class harry was about to go to the great hall for lunch when someone called from behind potter it was mcgonagall may i have a word with you harry turned on his heel and went to mcgonagall desk harry knew what was coming she was going to sermon him about his attitude a while ago potter mcgonagall spoke i ve been noticing a lot of uncooperativeness from you recently if you really want to become an auror then why fail in class professor flitwick has told me that you got a poor on your practical test last week remember that i promised you that i will help you to become an auror but your lack of cooperation makes me think otherwise so answer me this is there anything bothering you anything at all harry looked at mcgonagall for the first time in his life harry look at her as if she was someone who cared for him a lot almost like a grandmother you can tell me it might help you boosting your grades up harry pondered whether to tell mcgonagall about his recent problem would be appropriate she is the deputy headmistress of the school and it would feel like talking to dumbledore dumbledore would she tell him if harry let out what he was feeling it was worth the risk he needed to talk to someone who could understand well she asked sternly harry took a deep breath and said i ve been having weird thoughts lately that it makes me very distracted potter i know about the death of your godfather and that no it not about sirius harry cut her off it it about something else something very serious taking a moment of silence harry sighed there is something i want to say to my friends but i canttell since i afraid that they would er think of me differently like some freak or something mcgonagall nodded thoughtfully i see look potter if you want to keep your grades up you have to get over this tell them whatever you have to say i pretty sure that they ll understand but what if they don t said harry what if they dontspeak to me ever again potter mcgonagall shook her head slowly i ve known ms granger for five years and it is the truth that she is an understanding person and that she always keeps her promises and mr weasley is as faithful as anyone i ve known if you talk to them try to tell them to promise that they wontreact the way you fear they would harry didntquestion how mcgonagall knew he was referring to ron and hermione so all he did was nod now go for your lunch i ve got paper work to do she said as she waved her wand making a quill write down on parchment papers checking them while she did her own set of parchment papers harry muttered a thank you and left the classroom feeling different than when he came in the room an hour ago harry wasntready to tell them yet but mcgonagall was right he has to get over his problems in order to put his grades up he felt guilty that he wasntthat cooperative with mcgonagall in his studies to become an auror sulking over a prophecy that is yet to happen in a long a time is almost pointless it has been three days since mcgonagall talked to him and it was already saturday he was already feeling confident that harry thought it would be a good idea to corner them in the common room while everyone was at breakfast so they can have a lot of privacy ron hermione harry called them from behind while everyone was pouring out of the common room ron and hermione stopped on their tracks and turned to him yes ron and hermione said in unison may i speak with you harry halfheartedly said ron and hermione exchanged looks and harry noticed hermione pursing her lips anxiously of course you can harry hermione said you can tell us anything yeah we were worried about you ron spoke so er what it is you want to talk about then before harry could open his mouth he realized how risky this would be how will they take it will they be afraid of his safety will they desert him will they feel awkward with his situation that one of them or both of them will not talk to him you know what harry looked at the ground not looking at them never mind it just stupid harry hermione walked towards him and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder donthold it in i know how much you want to tell i can feel it harry looked up as hermione held his cheek she looked at him while her brown eyes were anxiously looking at his brilliant green ones please harry dontdeny the fact that we care for you as much as we known you you can talk to us harry held hermione hand which was still holding his cheek he took her hand while looking at her and nodded oh harry hermione said quietly pulling him in a hug making him feel for the first time in a long time comfortable and cared for ron pulled hermione away as harry was already feeling taut as she was hugging too tight before i tell you anything i want you to promise me that no matter what happens you ll always be here for me okay harry said ron and hermione nodded okay harry sighed it was now or never harry told them everything every single detail on how he felt and how he reacted towards his environment they listened to everything he said while hermione would nudge ron on the ribs if he interrupted harry was feeling every invisible weight in his body disappear as he rambled on he thought everything went uphill when he started to tell them about the prophecy there is one thing you should know harry bit his lower lip do you still remember the prophecy about me and voldemort the one that broke last june before we could even see what was inside it ron and hermione nodded well harry took a deep breath after our fiasco back at the department of mysteries dumbledore told me what was inside it he was the one who heard it from professor trelawney sixteen years ago in the hog head then harry told them about everything dumbledore told him two months ago from dumbledore plan on how to keep harry safe from the terrible truth that he been hiding all along and finally he told ron and hermione what the prophecy said after talking there was dead silence harry prayed in his mind that nothing bad would happen next after a very long silent moment ron spoke what what did it mean it meant that a boy will be born with the power to destroy voldemort that boy is me i was born on the end of the seventh month though there is another one who did too who qualifies the things that was said in the prophecy who hermione asked neville neville ron and hermione said in unison yes but voldemort chose me not neville so nothing will change in the prophecy i wish it did but no he gave me this damn scar to mark me but it could ve been a mistake ron cried are you sure you heard it right harry nodded how could i forget something so true and so horrible but hermione spoke the prophecy said that neither can live while the other survives said harry but then hermione was breathing fast and deep then that means that either you or voldemort has to kill each other while the other one is alive till the end harry assured her hermione held her chest while she breathed fast harry feared she was freaking out but it cantbe true hermione spoke her voice was shaking and rising cantit it must be a mistake remember that divination is an imprecise branch of magic it wasnta mistake hermione said harry it was true but what if it was a mistake hermione cried it cantbe you it just can t it might be neville hermione harry cautiously said dumbledore already confirmed that neville isntthe chosen one i am voldemort chose no one but me hermione was already in tears oh my god i i cantbelieve what i hearing harry you cantbe the chosen one what if you get killed i dont it just that oh harry harry looked down on the floor as hermione turned and walked towards a corner sobbing harry didntexpect this hermione was always the understanding one why doesntshe at least care that he needs his friend support hermione said ron donttake this too hard hermione turned biting her lower lip while she was fighting of sobs and tears too hard it is too hard ron even if the prophecy is true we have no idea if harry is capable of defeating the most powerful dark wizard of our time if that means losing harry then i dontwant to believe it harry closed his eyes he was a bit angry and very concerned about hermione reaction he knew how she felt how it felt to know that someone you cared for is in a situation that involves death at least be supportive ron pleaded i am supportive she cried i am just worried what voldemort might do to you she looked at harry with her bloodshot eyes hermione said harry i dunno what will i do right now but i will do anything to defeat him i cantescape that no matter what it will happen hermione whether you like it or not i must fight with him even when i not strong enough hermione sniffed and covered her face with her hands harry looked down sad on what he was seeing hermione was just crying at the corner while ron looked like he was touched by an electric wire you know said hermione i canteven look at you right now she was referring to harry hermione walked up the girl dormitory and when they heard the slam of the door above harry looked at ron dontworry mate he said i shocked and sad as you are but i believe you can defeat you know who hermione is just taking this rather too hard she cares a lot about you you know harry looked at the dormitory stairs and wished he could go up and talk to her but due to the restriction of males going up the girl dormitories that canthappen c mon harry said ron let go harry felt very worried about hermione behavior last weekend he somehow wished he could undo what he did back then he felt so stupid doing it but what baffles him most was the way hermione took the news it was almost unhermione hermione didnttalk with harry for the next few days ron would tell harry that she wouldntwant to talk about him or the prophecy harry was glad ron was with him it made harry even gladder that ron believed in him hermione silent treatment brought harry to think that he should at least talk to her make her see things the way he does or probably solve why hermione is like this she is always reasonable and rational in situations like this harry wanted to know he had a plan on the day before halloween harry left a note in hermione bag telling her that he wants to talk to her in the astronomy tower at eight o clock ron didntknow this since harry was concerned that ron might tell hermione in advance that night harry took his invisibility cloak and left the common room for the astronomy tower hoping that hermione would come he hasntseen her since breakfast harry went up the grand staircase pondering what will happen will she understand hermione intentions were now a top priority to harry the prophecy wasntin his mind anymore despite that the circumstance is related to it his feet dragged along to the top floor and he found himself on the foot of the staircase which leads to astronomy tower harry climbs to the top of it and pushed the door open to see hermione already there waiting for him hermione hermione looked at him she looked dead serious i saw this in my bag she took out the note he wrote earlier harry tried to force a smile but refrained from doing so hermione harry started i concerned about you and your behavior for the past few days i know the prophecy is hard to believe but it will happen no matter what might come i know harry she was fiddling with her hands i sorry i had to shout like that i was just sad and shocked knowing that you have this big decision to make she took out a handkerchief and blew her nose please dontcry harry pleaded after dating cho i realized that crying women make me uncomfortable sorry hermione apologized wiping away tears there was a long silence so harry broke the ice why were you acting like that anyway hermione didntmeet harry eyes i i already told you i just shocked that you you are in danger of being killed that not what you said harry assured her you said that you were sad and shocked because of how big this is oh hermione replied weakly wiping her nose fighting back more tears can you tell me truthfully what you are feeling said harry hermione took a deep breath which became a soft hiccup okay well the reason why i freaked out was that i i dontwant to lose you really i don t i tried to not believe it i convinced myself how imprecise divination is but no just like you said it inevitable i just cantbelieve that you are in danger of being killed and i always wondering if you are scared as much as i am harry allowed her to make a small sob i sorry she said inaudibly you have to see me like this it okay you have every right said harry placing a placate hand on her shoulder which made her shiver after for a few minutes harry placed his hand down and looked at his best friend looking at the ground actually hermione said there is also another reason she gave harry a very significant look what reason then in an instant harry felt a bit taken aback when hermione cheeks turn a faint shade of red she bit her lower lip and looked around nervously harry has never seen hermione this nervous before she continued rocking on the balls of feet and with another deep breath i think i er seeing you in a way that i shouldn t she gulped as she bit her lower lip harry urged her to go on i think she continued i in love with you then her face exploded with redness as she looked down the words took a long time to register in harry mind then it hit him he looked at her blushing face and now realized why hermione was so heartrending oh harry said in realization that is why i like this harry hermione said taking her courage up you are the chosen one you have to defeat voldemort whether you like it or not then she took a deep breath i loved you ever since we became friends harry you were like my brother till last year when i realized how hard it is for you to cope with things she was walking closer to harry you weren t happy it made me sad to see my friend that way and now with this i not sure if you ll survive voldemort she sniffed moving closer to harry if you die then i ll never forgive myself for not telling you how i feel harry was already aware that hermione was close to him and without jerking his head away from her hermione pressed her lips against his harry eyes widened like dishes to see what was happening hermione is kissing him hermione held harry cheek and after the very brief kiss hermione pulled away as she looked at harry with tears already streaming down her face she wasntblushing anymore i just want you to be happy she said very weakly fighting the urge to cry then without a word hermione left the tower leaving harry shocked than ever hearing the sound of the wind and the distant crying of hermione as she went down the astronomy tower to be continued read and review season 1 finale xviii the prophecy ii you are the chosen one you have to defeat voldemort whether you like it or not i loved you ever since we became friends harry you were like my brother till last year when i realized how hard it is for you to cope with things you weren t happy it made me sad to see my friend that way and now with this i not sure if you ll survive voldemort if you die then i ll never forgive myself for not telling you how i feel i just want you to be happy these words swirled in harry mind as he walked back to the common room like a zombie this was so unexpected he thought hermione of all people would be in love with him the thought of it made him numb from the head to the toes her feelings for him sparked lots of realizations that he was so blind of was that why hermione looked at him weird when he had his first kiss with cho she did sound interrogating when he told them he then remembered hermione failing to tell him to make a good excuse to cho during his date when was going to get an interview with rita skeeter the very same day did she fail to mention this in purpose she did give him advice on his relationship with cho but didntwork out so well where they intended to be bad advice so hermione can let harry do stupid things in front of cho so they can both breakup just to let hermione swoop in on the fray the idea was a bit appalling but it almost made sense how about before fifth year did hermione leave any hints of her liking him well there were times when she would grab his arm and hug him instantly was she taking advantage harry nearly stumbled at a jagged flagged stone on the floor which brought his senses back realizing that he was already on the top landing of the grand staircase if he climbs down right now he can avoid the consequences of letting the staircase move and bringing him to another place back into his thoughts harry started thinking about hermione again why why her harry always looked at her like a sister nothing more she saw her at the yule ball and she was indeed very pretty but he didntfeel it or did he harry was already in front of the portrait of the fat lady and muttered the password snowflake which leads him into the common room half hoping that hermione wasntin there fortunately she wasntexcept for a group of third years a couple of first years ron and ginny before harry walked towards them he realized that he was about share an experience that would make things uncomfortable he knew very well that ron had a major crush on hermione and he was not sure if ron got over it what if he told them ron would not talk to him reiterating painful memories from his fourth year harry made a good recovery doing a backing away quickly and walking up towards the dormitory he wasntkeen into doing as dudley told harry ones about teenage girls when he was boasting about having a girlfriend kiss and tell he pulled the hangings of his four poster and lay on his back wondering where on earth is hermione now and what was she thinking as he is here doing the same she was probably at her dormitory crying her eyes out after what she did harry thought harry lifted his hands and touched his lips the spot where hermione kissed him his head went to hermione was she expecting him to kiss back or return what she thinks feelings to her did she cry out disappointment harry rolled on his bed and felt an uncomfortable lurch in his stomach he remembered that hermione would be tutoring him and ron about advance transfiguration as mcgonagall told she would do the thought of him ron and hermione being in the library and being tutored by a girl who kissed him last night would seem very very weird i just want to make you happy for the first time since he heard the prophecy these words now haunted harry in a way as if he would never be happy again a small prickle in the back of his neck made him realize he was a bit cold and was about grab his invisibility cloak on the foot of the bed where he left it since crookshanks pooped on his sheets three days ago he realized it wasntthere and forgot about it when he heard footsteps coming outside the door opened and harry saw through the small opening of the hangings to see ron entering the dorm looking a bit worried harry he called harry ignored him harry hermione told me to check on you are you okay harry stomach made another uncomfortable lurch hermione told ron to check if he was okay why doesntshe just climb up and do that herself the sound of the door slamming signaled ron departure harry looked up at the air wishing that he didnttell the prophecy to ron and hermione doing it made a whole mess in his friendship with hermione why did he have to spill yesterday he had one big problem to worry about and now he seems to have a million of problems but it really was two harry sighed deeply removed his glasses places them on the end table beside him and fell asleep harry woke up from the cold that was crawling on his skin he opened his eyes to see the dormitory deserted and his invisibility cloak on the foot of his bed harry swung his legs out of bed and rubbed his eyes today while everyone went on the scheduled hogsmeade trip he would be tutored by the one who is in love with him shoud he go feeling dread in his gut harry dressed up and grabbed his transfiguration things and went down on the common room hello harry called on the deserted common room harry checked his watch to see it was already half past eight he was late for the tutoring harry climbed out of the portrait hole and rushed for the library he held a stitch on his side as he entered the library excuse me harry asked madam pince the strict librarian er did hermione granger and ron weasley came here saying hermione name was also uncomfortable to harry i sorry potter said the librarian but i haventseen them in a while if i do i will call your attention immediately with worry and hurt in his feelings harry left the library with his advance transfiguration clutched under his arm wondering where they could be the thought of hermione and ron studying together and leaving him out of it hurt him like a curse on the chest was hermione already leaving him in the dark because of what she did last night does she want anything to do with him now that she admitted she loved him more than anything right now harry scratched his head out of frustration as he made his way for the transfiguration classroom thinking that was the most obvious place to go like the library they werentthere and this made harry almost feel worse than before they always worked in the library and hermione said if not there then go the transfiguration classroom but if they are not here then where should he go next harry ran towards the nearest deserted classroom but found no one there the next place was the library again just incase he was there too early but they werentthere harry gave up and decided to go back to the common room guessing that they were there while he acted like an idiot looking for them he returned to the common room to see it crowded by first and second years they must ve come back from breakfast harry did nothing but ignores the eyes of some curious first years and climbed back to his dormitory harry came down from the dormitory an hour later after procrastinating his time on why wasntron and hermione available at the time he was supposed to be with them there was still no sign of them and it started to tick him off where were they he got his answer some time around twilight when the students from hogsmeade returned surprisingly among the crowd was ron harry called ron as he approached towards harry where were you hermione said that you would be at hogsmeade what harry asked puzzlingly remember she said you didntcome to tutoring because you were busy or something and decided to tutor in another area then you we would meet us at three broomsticks afterwards and then you werentthere what gives hermione reckoned you were late but you didntcome all day harry shook his head dumbstruck what do you mean are you i wasntgoing to tutoring because i was busy and you tutored in another place yes said ron and that i would meet you two in the three broomsticks and that i didntmeet you mmhmm and hermione said all of this yup when you werentat three broomsticks she said that you probably didntwant to come after all promising that you would what harry said loudly making some gryffindors look at him surprisingly she said that he hissed er yeah are you okay harry ron asked cautiously harry stared into space feeling like someone slapped him in the face why was hermione cutting him off why the hell did she lie to ron making him think harry was a no show he acted like a poor idiot running around the castle unknown that they were tutoring in another place that hermione failed to mention to him sure it would be awkward studying with her after last night events but why is she cutting him off from her the thought of her doing this made harry shake with anger and the very thought that hermione would even dare to lie and make ron think harry broke his promise made him even so mad where hermione harry spat ron looked a bit taken aback but answered she she went to the room of requirement that where we studied she went there to get something without saying a word harry dashed out of the common room and walked towards the room of requirement which was only nearby considering that the common room was on the same floor and only a few walks apart harry saw the familiar door to the room and noticed it stood ajar he saw movements through the gap and caught a glimpse of bushy brown hair waving inside without hesitating harry banged the door open which made hermione jump and look at him with uttermost horror i got a bone to pick with you harry spat at her wha what she stuttered ron just told me that you reckoned i wontbe on today tutoring what failed to mention it to me he also said that you were studying in another venue forcing me to look like an idiot walking around the school holding a heavy damn book asking questions about where you two were did you even care to mention it to me or left me a note or pass the message to ron so he can tell me harry hermione breathed look why are you cutting me off what because after that stupid kiss you are so freaked out about me and you were afraid about how i would react so you plan to get rid of me i have feelings to you know you tell me yours and now i tell you mine but it looks like you arentallowing that are you you think you ll tell me then you ll leave me having more problems in my life harry please harry cuts her off what does it take for me to let you know how i feel about this thing and to know that i damn care what what do do do i have to save your life from a troll protect you from a giant that was about to hurt you allow you to hold my arm a billion times hug me for comfort stopping someone from hurting you from killing curses feel very very worried when i thought you were dead make you feel welcome let you kiss me and me accepting it oh wait a minute i did all those damn things hermione there was a slight pause harry please listen to me no harry cut her off again raising a hand you know what save it i just decided that maybe the feelings you admitted last night didntmean anything maybe the feelings that i might develop for you are fake he paused then thanks a lot hermione be happy when your best friend dies harry wait harry ignored her and left the room feeling angrier than before and a bit guilty for shouting at the person who has never shouted at him it was a bad night for harry he didntgo down for dinner feeling the uncomfortable lurch in his stomach again he yelling at someone so supportive of him throughout the years was as worst killing life itself harry turned on his bed and wiped his eyes imagining the sad and hurt face of hermione in the room of requirement when he left harry was angry but his compassion and guilt took over him and made him feel pity for her he knew that it would be a long time till he ever talked to her again she was in love with him after all the door opened behind him making him jump to see it was ron looking at him with concern harry can i speak with you harry shrugged a bit which ron took as a yes erm it about hermione said ron sitting on his bed harry felt a bit of a belly flop on his stomach what what about hermione i saw her crying at the library before dinner i thought of finding her there since she wasntat the room of requirement did something happen to her why would you think that said harry well she said the most unusual thing i was comforting her then i asked her what was wrong then she said nothing was wrong but i knew there was do you have any clue harry shook his head hmmm ron continued do you think she still bothered about the prophecy why would she she probably got over it in time was she normal back in tutoring this morning harry lied yeah kinda but nothing odd was there ron replied anyway i asked her again what was really wrong then she kind of got irritated on me and said i fine my knickers are just too tight he was shaking amusingly i was like what in bloody hell i left her to find you you know just incase you might know something do you harry gulped and his heart beat a bit faster no ron sighed well after what she said it made me want to ask you this harry he stood up and moved to harry and looked at him in the eye alright tell me the whole truth harry harry was already biting his lower lip having the gut feeling that ron will break him that he would tell what he did to her a while ago tell me harry were you or were you not in a wedgie spree and for the first time ever in harry life harry realized how dense ron can be in solving problems it almost made him laugh of course harry said no telling him he didntpull a wedgie on hermione or anyone rather after a bit of chit chat ron left leaving harry to his business harry thought it was all over with ron when he came back in again ron i told you i didnt harry turned to see hermione looking at him with so much determination and fury in her eyes oh said harry it you hermione slammed the door behind her she looked very angry and sad do you think i dontcare about you she hissed shaking in anger while tears were welling up in her chocolate brown eyes do you even know how hard it is to know that you are likely going to die she sniffed well news flash harry it is hard how can i live without you oh how would feel to wake up everyday knowing that someone you cared for is gone from your life she took a deep breath and continued voldemort will come out and try to kill you eventually i believe you can defeat him but how can i be sure that a hundred percent that you will be back from voldemort safely i was trying to avoid you because i wasntready to face the fact that someone i fell in love with would likely die in the hands of someone evil that hell itself spat him back out harry didntanswer back so if you think i ignored you and abandonedyou because you dontmean as much to me as everybody else well you re wrong it because you mean more to me she pointed and poked his chest very hard hermione harry finally spoke what she spat harry walks over to her and kisses her on the lips ebbing all the anger the hate and the sadness away they pulled back while harry didntlook at her for a moment there was a very long pause between the two of then all of a sudden harry felt hermione hands grabbing his cheeks and made him turn to her then slowly hermione pulled him to kiss her harry returned the kiss and after a long minute of kissing they broke apart and hermione looked at down with teary eyes i so sorry harry hermione said quietly sobbing i didntmean to hurt you harry held her hands and smiled i sorry for shouting at you a while ago hermione smiled and hugged him while she rested on his chest harry looked at her and halfheartedly wrapped his hand around her making her feel comfortable harry then felt a sudden change in mood as if everything from his problems the prophecy sirius voldemort studies and the like disappeared from his mind it was a pleasant feeling a very pleasant feeling and they stayed that way in a world where there was no war no prophecies that decided their fate no slytherins that would insult you no teacher that would bully you just for the sake of it no nothing they just hugged while distant music of jazz started playing around them after the longest pause ever hermione muttered i love you harry smirked i know read and review please author note as promised season 2 of fluff collection will start sooner after last season finale i decided to start season 2 with a bang

interested go to my profile if you want some trivia and fact sheets about each of the 18 fluffs from season one it worth a read if you want to more harry potter h hr fluff collection proudly presents season two xix next year what a bunch of crap what is crap sir this rapticon sr gestured to the box on the ground harry turned to it and saw a box of fireworks which looked drenched and soiled what a box of fireworks doing here harry turned to the defense against the dark arts professor well harry said rapticon sr looking around at his desk for something after the huge success of the christmas ball last week i decided to make a new year bash for hogwarts he gleamed isntit that amazing harry remembered the last time it was new year at hogwarts it was kind of quiet for him but why are they er wet harry asked looking at the box of fireworks lets say a certain someone forgot to bring it inside from the freezing outdoors said rapticon sr irritably carrying the box to the table he casts a charm on it to make it dry but instead the fireworks flashed different colors eh rapticon sr scratched his head looking at the box puzzlingly i thought that would work he scoffed magic is not really my thing stupid voodoo harry has known rapticon sr as his professor of the defense against the dark arts this sixth year he was pure russian but was raised in america making his accent american rapticon sr nature was that of a sophisticated yet tough guy person who is witty and charismatic he was also a muggle not a muggle born but a pure muggle his magic abilities arentas good but they were at least better than that of draco malfoy ability how he was able to make contact to the wizarding world despite his muggle status well nobody knows why base on the stories elvis and figment rapticon sr friends who came along with him to hogwarts dumbledore had to convince the ministry of magic if he could let a pure muggle teach in hogwarts harry has no idea how that happened but for what the fates know dumbledore succeeded where will you have this new year party harry asked at the great hall he replied according to mcgonagall the ballroom we used for the christmas ball is too big for the small party i ve planned harry looked out the window wondering speaking of the christmas ball rapticon sr said anything happened between you and hermione the last time i saw you and she in the same room was when hermione gave viktor krum a tour around hogwarts two days after the ball harry shot a look at rapticon sr who was leaning on his table with an unmistakable grin we re fine nothing happened harry looked out the window again during the christmas ball harry was dateless but at the end he took hermione to the ball when she didntwant to the event made harry realized that he really really liked her dontdeny it harry you like her said rapticon sr harry sighed yes i do like her ever since she dated that git last month i was jealous you know harry felt a nudge and turned to see rapticon sr holding up two cups of hot chocolate offering the other one to harry harry smiled and took the other there will come a time harry rapticon sr looked out the window that you have to tell her how you feel it will probably not come out in another two or three months but it is inevitable harry drank his hot chocolate and looked out the window as an owl passed by thinking on when that day the day he will admit his feelings for hermione will come for what he knows it could be painful or happy they re scheduling a what hermione asked when harry returned to the common room an hour later a new year bash said harry sitting on one of the squashy armchairs professor raptor said that he and the teachers are hosting it after the huge success of the ball last week sounds interesting said hermione i ve never been in a new year party since i was seven oooh this is exciting a sudden flash of memories ran through hermione mind oh the memories of the fireworks she would goggle at during the point the clock strikes twelve midnight she sighed thinking that that would happen again since during her times as an eight year old and above she would be somewhere around the country with her family and the thing lacking during the new year night with her family is the street party fireworks and the television showing the news channels doing countdowns but the tradition that didntdie in those trips was her family would gather around and sing auld lang syne joyfully do we need to dress formally ron asked no harry replied you can wear anything just dontgo on starkers then you ll be fine hermione smirked at harry comment which harry caught he smirked back at her which made her bite her lower lip and continue what she was doing writing a letter to her parents she doesntknow why but ever since her breakup with alex weeks ago she been look at harry at a new light not just any new light but more of an attraction he was the first one to comfort her after her breakup it was sad yet comforting then at the ball she didnt want to come but harry took her to the ball and danced with her boys that being ron and harry and with harry being the most intimate dance it made her a bit shaken at the end but her meeting with viktor krum during the ball made harry thought she was blowing him off she of course went with harry instead and ended the night in good terms but nothing happened though anything else we should know said ron oh yeah professor raptor said that he will make sure every muggle tradition is implemented in this party i dunno what he means but who knows remember when he had bumblefoot dontremind of that again ron shook his head i couldntsleep with the thought of knowing i could die tomorrow hermione laughed well we better be glad that that over oooh do you think we get to have a countdown timer i think so replied harry i remember dudley screaming the countdown into my cupboard he frowned and turned to look out the window hermione gave harry a concerned look harry would sometimes slip something about the dursleys but she would never thought of him being a bit affected by mentioning them harry has never told her and ron about his past with the dursleys is there something wrong harry hermione asked no nothing harry waved an impatient hand i jus realized how lousy my new years were we we never had one in hogwarts right i dontrecall any ron said but i do remember fred and george shooting filibusters on easter but i really didnt know what that was about hermione sighed and started thinking about the new year bash party how fun that would be hermione thought the christmas ball must ve changed her attitude towards events like these she usually the one who isntfor the crowds but after the yule ball and christmas ball she seems to appreciate them but she remembered how timid she was at parties especially in parties with family when her cousins would try to talk to her but she would just bite her lower lip and run to the bathroom like harry hermione new year parties werentflawless she remembered during the new year party that was held in her school back at godric hollow during the countdown part everyone started saying they should give a new year kiss to someone during the countdown the eight year old hermione tried to look for her grandfather who she affectionately calls grand per she wanted to give him a kiss for the new year but when the countdown reached zero the first kiss she got was from the school bully it was horrible hermione shuddered when the thought of his large lips touched her cheek that really made her cry but her grand per comforted her and gave the kiss she wanted to make that night better a kiss for the new year a tradition hermione loathed ever since that happened from that day on she always stuck to her family members in parties just incase some boy kisses her then it hit her like a broom on the head a kiss for the new year a kiss a kiss to someone yes but there will be a party professor raptor said that he will make all muggle traditions present then a kiss for the new year is likely to be present a kiss for the new year it was at this time hermione turned to the first person her chocolate brown eyes landed harry kissing harry on the point the clock strikes midnight hermione mind laughed that rich would he like it it so obvious that he would like one from her hermione remembered her dance with him in the ball it likely but was that just a fake did harry dance with her for granted well he did asked her out to the ball so it obvious he wouldntmind being kissed on new year eve erm i think i realized something hermione said after her long trance what harry and ron said in unison nothing she stood up i ll see you pretty soon hermione left the common room and shook her head while she went down the grand staircase what was she thinking her kissing harry impossible hermione would never kiss her best friend but her feelings for him were running in her system like wildfire she wanted to get it out she wanted to be free from her feelings for harry it just wrong they ve made the pact and sealed it a long time ago nothing should happen between the two of them hermione wanted to kick herself for making that pact with harry if there was no pact then they d probably be going out by now but either way it is wrong very wrong best friends shouldntbe kissing and have romance what if hermione admits her feelings to harry would he get mad feel weird if so then she will be losing one of the most important people in her life hermione didntknow where she was going but realized she was in front of the great hall and there was so much noise in there her curiosity getting to her hermione took a peek and was awed at what she saw the great hall looked nothing like before it was decorated with lots of streamers large rocket shaped sculptures and the same ice sculpture from the christmas ball the four house tables have been moved to the sides of room serving as buffet tables leaving a large area on the center of the hall careful said a voice from hermione right hermione turned to see elvis and figment one of professor raptor friends setting up some christmas tree replaced with streamers confetti and baby rockets as decorations she walked over there to hear figment speak careful he said as elvis placed a baby rocket on the side careful careful figment shouted making elvis jump elvis glared at him i will be careful unless told otherwise elvis spat hello hermione greeted figment and elvis jumped forcing elvis to accidentally ignite one of the baby rockets making it zoom to the ceiling of the great hall and exploding to a magnificent shower of gold and red hermione figment replied what brings you here i just wanted to see the place that all hermione smiled looking above as the sparkles of red and gold vanished as it fell to the ground oh then dontscare us like that elvis panted placing another baby rocket on the tree sorry hermione giggled er why are you decorating a christmas tree with fireworks oh this figment pointed to the tree apparently and firstly decorations for new year suck big time elvis added hermione shook her head what makes you say that c mon elvis waved his hands matter of factly streamers fireworks confetti meh i d prefer the easter bunny than father new year father new year hermione asked new to this information you haventheard about father new year elvis said placing a hand on his chest in a dramatic way father new year is the equivalent of santa clause he wears a jump suit that says crackers me booty behind his teeth are made of firecrackers and it is truth that he rides into the sunset with a fat blue chicken believe me father new year is a fraud and a lame excuse for a santa clause figment interrupted you have to figment said something that made elvis go figment not in front of the kids things up so you could mess people minds dunderhead alright alright elvis apologized sorry for messing things up if it makes you happy then i ll shut up you better or i ll aaaah elvis flailed his arms making a defensive position i ll do it hermione left the two behind hoping she wontwitness anything violent she looked around the great hall and saw professor flitwick using magic to give the house tables skirts to the left of the hall mcgonagall could be seen shooting streamers out of her wand to dress the bare wall to a colorful one right above the high table where the teachers usually sat had a large banner that said happy new year flashing in different colors kind of like the one hermione and the others used when harry had his first quidditch match during their first year excellent called a voice to hermione right hermione turned to see professor raptor testing a bowl of grape juice with a pale looking professor snape the libations are fine for the party this saturday what do you think serverus hermione couldnthelp but stifle a giggle when snape forced a smile they are fine he said curtly now can we move on with the other meals i ve been drinking nothing but grape fruit yeah but it wasntlong since ya drank that bottle of firewhisky eh rapticon sr winked smirking snape turned to look around cautiously and nearly flinched at the sight of hermione ms granger he drawled keeping his cool er arentyou supposed to be in the library studying studying rapticon sr said why should they it the holidays man they should be relaxing than studying their ass off on a test that you will likely to fail them hermione smiled gingerly sorry i was just walking around and saw the great hall it fantastic well rapticon sr smiled it was all serverus idea see he put an arm around snape as if they were good buddies while snape was thinking otherwise he thought of using streamers instead of balloons genious eh he made a furtive wink to hermione who tried to bite her lower lip from laughing erm professor raptor may i speak with you why sure hermione said rapticon sr removing his snape from his grasp you can test the other food serverus but remember they re just food hermione caught snape ears reddening when she and rapticon sr walked away from the buffet table what do you want to talk about hermione rapticon sr spoke when they left earshot from the other teachers er i just want to ask if er it true that all muggle traditions will be implemented in the party yup all true so that means er hermione had a faint shade of red above her nose what rapticon sr asked never mind hermione turned trying to hide her blushing face would she ask he is the only pure muggle in the castle c mon tell me it will eat ya up if you hide it too long he gave hermione that fatherly look hermione looked up at him realizing how short she was and sighed okay er is it possible that erm that that that that that that what rapticon sr asked that er you know since muggle tradition will be implemented here does it make it possible that when midnight comes all the fireworks would fly and explode rapticon sr answered no the other thing that happens when midnight comes she was already looking a bit pink in the cheeks other thing rapticon sr rubbed his chin with his thumb and forefinger other thing other thing what other thing hermione looked at her shoes started sliding her right foot on the ground idly she looked up again and saw rapticon sr still thinking midnight he muttered other thing other thing lets see fireworks countdown people screaming end of the world hermione was a bit taken aback when rapticon sr eyes widened she felt really small when he turned to her very slowly ehem hermione coughed er i have the feeling you found out right she spoke in a very squeaky voice rapticon sr nodded it nothing to be ashamed of hermione you were curious i respect ones curiosity he looked around speaking of curiosity why d you ask i i wanted to know that all hermione made a shy wave to her professor and turned on her heel she pondered on what she would do now till something made her wonder er professor hermione asked turning to rapticon sr yeah he asked do do you even know what i was talking about she asked yeah he replied you were asking if kissing on the strike of midnight is part of the party and to answer that question yes hermione bit her lower lip i read sherlock holmes granger so my deduction skills can be as superior as sherlock said rapticon sr seriously with a slyness glint in his green eyes you can go now by the way see ya at the party on saturday it was at this moment that hermione saw how amazing rapticon sr ego can be with logic when she left the great hall getting the thought about kissing harry on the strike of midnight on new year eve was as hard as ignoring elvis and figment argument while she was sitting by the lake for relaxation apparently they ve been arguing about the weirdest thing she ever heard i telling you no italics figment spat how are you doing this i dunno elvis waved his hands apologetically it not my fault underlines dammit figment swore i said no underlines how many times did i tell you elvis pleaded i didntdo anything whatever just dontdo anything bold figment made a sigh of defeat oh crap dont look at me elvis thumbed his chest i aintdoing any letters this time excuse me hermione asked politely with faint irate in her voice could you kindly keep down guys the two looked at her s o rr y he r mi on e dammit elvis stop it figment slapped him with a black glove hey cheap shot elvis whined rubbing his cheek hey it gone i know figment spat and i hope you dontdo it again i didntdo it hermione shook her head and left the lake for a more peaceful spot every student she passed was taking about the party tomorrow night ever since they received letters during breakfast hermione took out her letter she received from a tawny owl and reread it season greetings prior to the success of the christmas ball on christmas last week the school has decided to host another event for the benefit of the students teachers and staff on december 31st saturday seven o clock in the evening there will be a new years party held at the great hall to give the whole year a happy ending it deserves the party will be filled with entertainment from dances performances from a guest singer fireworks displays attire will be smart casual any head gear will be removed and expensive jewelry will be confiscated food and drinks will be prepared for you in the party we hope this event will be as successful and pleasant as the ball for the benefit of the school sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress hermione folded her letter and found herself in front of the great hall which looked nothing like the place hermione knew since she was eleven the double doors were decorated with glossy buntings and japanese paper which were all decorated with equality and impressiveness the doors were locked and a sign was up that said no admittance except on party business which was very familiar since the words came from a book hermione read when she was young the great hall was closed for the past two days so the school had to eat their breakfast in their respective common rooms hermione had the gut feeling she was the only one who saw the great hall in its new year splendor it came to mind that she didntwhere she was going when she bumped into someone on the hallway leading to the grand staircase sorry she said startled looking at who she bumped but was a bit surprised it was harry hermione harry smiled you donthave to say sorry you seem to be deep in thought so it can happen to anyone hermione smirked back anything bothering you harry asked as they walked down the hallway nothing really hermione lied i was just thinking about the party tomorrow i fine at least you are fine harry said i bit my lip a while ago he licked them with his brows furrowed do you see any blood hermione didntknow what she was seeing harry lips or harry licking his lips it was making her nervous and more anxious to kiss him hermione harry said waking her up from her reverie are you sure you are okay it was the umpteenth time hermione bit her lower lip this week it made her lower lip a bit swollen but at least it would make her shut up before she could ramble something accidentally i fine harry hermione said in a very high and squeaky voice i i just remembered something bye she took off before hearing what harry would say she nearly kicked herself for thinking about midnight tomorrow with desperation but why should she be scarred she does like him a lot and would do anything to have him this party is the perfect opportunity to kiss him it sounded desperate but she wanted it and it makes her happy hermione stopped on her tracks and breathed deeply should she kiss him if yes then how can she do it she cantjust walk and kiss him when everyone shouts zero during the countdown he might feel offended for something like that or something to that sort maybe asking him politely would do the trick yeah asking him would do thinking this through would require a lot of time looking around for any sign of harry catching up to her she was relieved that he didntsee any sign of harry so without hesitation she ran for the common room today was already the day the day the new year bash party will happen hermione looked at her watch to see it was still eleven o clock in the morning in the common room was she going to do this before she slept hermione stayed in the common room to think if she could ask harry to kiss her at midnight it was hard and weird a bit but she likes him a lot so it seems right for her hermione hermione jumped and turned on her seat and saw ron ron hermione gasped you scared me sorry bout that he sat beside her on the couch i was just checking on you to see if you were okay hermione scratched the nape of her neck what makes you think i not okay well i ve noticed you ve been avoiding something lately or should i say someone hermione shot a look at ron you donthave it hermione said shortly oh yes i have ron said looking a bit triumphant i know there is something going on with you why dontyou tell me i your best friend i can t ron they are my secrets and i not very keen on worrying about them knowing that someone knows them ron scooted closer to her and placed a brotherly arm around her hermione it disturbs me to see you like this really usually you are the one with all answers you are the problem solver but a hermione with problems she canthandle he raised an eyebrow that something i have to look into hermione smiled at ron over the years they ve been friends who bicker at each other but now they seem to be like brother and sister the thought of it might make lavender shake her head since she thinks ron is the one for her lavender mind and even though hermione has no idea why she thought of it a thousand of muggles could be screaming right now if they knew what she was feeling towards ron is there anything you want to tell me hermione ron asked hermione sighed she trusted him so much okay she took a deep breath recently i ve been seeing someone in a different way a special way rather i want him to know how i feel but i afraid he might you know reject me ron made a very thoughtful nod did he get what she said hermione knew ron was a logical person but there are times he can be clueless i think the answer to your problem hermione is to tell him yourself ron said i know it will be scary or risky but if he rejects you so what harry and i will be there for you the sound of harry name echoed in her brain like a horn i sorry if that didnthelp ron said quickly seeing hermione lost face i i not really good at this whole advice thing it usually you doing the whole thing he chuckled hermione smirked at him like giving advice so you can talk to luna ron gave her a look of mixed surprise and realization what do you mean nothing hermione twiddled her thumbs fiyuna has been telling me things lately ron smiled at her and for the first time ever kissed her on the forehead i know it wonthelp but it would feel a lot better if you tell the guy that you like him and if he rejects you then just like i said me and harry will be there at your side we wont leave you out in the cold ron patted her on the back and left the common room hermione slouched on her seat wincing at the thought of harry rejecting her it would really hurt her she was confident that harry might like her back but what if she was wrong she can always be wrong she may be smart but she not wise there is a small chance he will reject her and that small chance scares her despite these thoughts hermione was still to determine to kiss harry on midnight even if it risks losing one of the dearest friends to her all negative thoughts aside she going to do it hermione left the common room a little later to look for harry she wanted to talk to him about merlin knows what she didntwant to ask harry yet she just wanted to talk to him that all hermione climbed down the grand staircase and checked the great hall at the entrance hall the sign was still there and it still gave hermione a familiar light where did she read it before she continued on to find harry the lake was a good place to start since she finds him there all the time and if not then probably at the quidditch pitch flying the thought of quidditch reminded her of her painful arm she should be careful of not throwing the quaffle too hard hermione rubbed her arm remembering twisting it too much when she was practicing last week with harry harry was even the one who helped her to the hospital wing to get it fixed she reached the lake to find lots of students but harry there she left for the quidditch pitch and saw no one there feeling a bit worried hermione went back to the castle thinking harry is at the common room it was at the hallway where the defense against the dark arts was is when hermione heard voices i canttake her out of my head it pretty obvious you like her hermione stopped on her tracks she knew the two voices one belonged to professor raptor while the other belonged to harry getting her curiosity the best of her hermione walked towards the door that lead to the classroom of the defense against the dark arts and pressed her ear on the oak wood this is what she heard i telling you harry this party is the perfect opportunity said the gruff american accented voice of rapticon sr if you take it as an ass in mississippi then dontgo kissing up at all look harry voice said i nervous okay what if she denies me i dontwant to lose her you wontharry rapticon sr said while the sound of a dull scraping of wood against the floor came you wont lose her i can tell ya she might likes ya more than you think there was dead silence seriously harry a ravenclaw there was another dead silence er erm yeah harry replied briskly it a ravenclaw damn rapticon sr swore under his breath and i thought my cards were right looks like elvis wins for the first time ever since the poker game of 92 excuse me professor harry cut him off er i kinda need help on this oh sorry bout that harry then the sound of a loud scraping of wood on the floor ringed through hermione ears my advice is just go for it try to um be polite to her if you want that kiss on midnight now look i waiting for a delivery of fireworks from a white bearded wizard in hogsmeade and i must be off hermione didntwhat was going on but there was another long silence and the next she knew she heard footsteps then the door opened making hermione gasp lose balance and fall on the ground face first hermione harry gasped hermione stood up briskly and looked at the two with her face looking a bit pink what were you doing rapticon sr asked i i was er she stuttered i was about to erm find harry and i i heard his voice so i came here and when i was about to er push the door open coincidently you opened too she finished with a biting of her lip okay rapticon sr said making a thoughtful nod and grabbed hi coat from a hat stand nearby alright harry i must be off see ya hermione rapticon sr left the hermione and harry alone on the corridor when he took a turn with the tail of his coat whipping out of sight hermione chuckled er so harry i i just want to talk to you about something what is it harry asked hermione bit her lower lip what should she say er i ve been meaning to tell you this but er er what harry raised his eyebrows er that sorry what harry asked again i didntquite understand what you said he chuckled hermione hung her head never mind hermione harry said is there something wrong hermione looked at harry he looked concern a face that was very known to her nope she lied i just want to ask if you are going to the party tonight i coming harry said you i coming too but i er maybe asking him wouldnthurt do you have any partners to go with to the party yeah you and ron when the whole thing registered to hermione brain she started to laugh a bit and made a playful push on harry shoulder what did i say something funny harry asked nothing hermione said stopping herself from giggling i just realized what you said when you said partners oh said harry er that didnt make any sense hermione stopped laughing sorry i just stressed about everything so far i just want to have a little fun when the party comes silence hermione just inflated her left cheek and started rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet so want to go back to the common room harry asked yeah i think that would be nice i mean fine that would be fine hermione said quickly the two walked towards the grand staircase not saying a word to each other hermione mind started swimming on what she ahs heard so harry eyes on a ravenclaw whatever happened to the spark that hermione felt back at the ball was it all just platonic she looked at harry did he just see her as a friend then and found someone else hermione remembered the thought of asking harry to kiss her on midnight she might ve looked stupid if she d asked him and found out he liked someone else they reached the common room a moment later and harry suddenly asked hey hermione want to er play wizards chess hermione shook her head no thanks i think i ll take a nap i need the energy if i want to enjoy the party later and without saying a word hermione ran up the girl dormitory feeling worst than ever well granger tonight is the night and dontexpect it to be spectacular hermione was wearing the dress she wore to the ball last week and climbed out of the portrait hole she wanted to go on alone she wasntkeen on seeing harry after what she heard earlier the party hasntstarted yet so hermione was expecting the great hall will be open though the sign that was put up there was still familiar to her she finally reached the entrance hall and her predictions were right the great hall doors were open and she could already see the lights decorations and food from the outside hermione entered the great hall and was awed at the place the faculty did an excellent job with the decorating the last time she was here it was nice but now its the walls were decorated with such evenness and the buffet looked delicious the high table where the faculty usually was was replaced with a high platform that looked like a stage the food looked excellent and realized most of them didnthave a touch of wizard feeling there were no floating drinks that you could get in mid air no weird looking food and the like it really looked muggle like rapticon sr must ve really taken it seriously you put it over there said a voice from afar hermione turned to see mcgonagall telling filch to put a stack of fireworks which he was holding under his arm at the corner and this is the great hall the place where the party will begin it was rapticon sr entering the great hall with a small group of people who were holding suitcases that looked like instruments they must be the band who ll be playing and to your right is the buffet said rapticon sr gesturing to the right and right here he stopped to hermione is a hogwarts student he winked at her hello professor hermione greeted looking at the band who looked around in awe hermione i want to introduce you to the band who ll be playing tonight guys this is hermione granger arguably the smartest witch in the school and hermione this is kevin henry the vocalist of the band pleasure hermione smiled as she shook hands with kevin henry well then rapticon sr clapped his hands together looks like you guys need to prepare there is a back room here where you can freshen yourselves up see ya hermione and oh he lowered to her i think you better get ready since i see students coming in he pointed toward the entranceway hermione looked up and saw students entering the party was about to start the party was a breeze nothing happened to hermione but there was great music and dancing which she didnt participate in hermione just stood by the bar which served grape juice she was drinking her second glass already when hermione hermione turned and nearly fell off her seat when she saw harry harry she gasped hi hey she felt harry eyes looking at her from head to toe you look nice he smirked oh she blushed a bit yeah thanks you just look like you were at the ball except for the hair harry commented oh i thought straight hair wasnt for me she said stroking the back of her head you look pretty anyway harry said sitting beside her and ordered a grape juice were you here a while ago i didntsee you in the common room i went here ahead hermione answered i wanted to check the place and it looks amazing she looked around i know harry looked also professor raptor did a superb job hasnthe he looked behind him look at malfoy hermione followed harry gaze and saw mafloy dancing something that look oddly like a bastardize version of the tango with pansy parkinson they both laughed briefly and looked at each other for a while before going for their drinks um hermione said putting her glass on the counter i ve been hearing about a er a gryffindor setting his eyes on a ravenclaw lately have any idea who it is hermione glanced at harry who looked a bit anxious i dontknow what you are talking about harry replied looking at the band singing a song i thought you knew hermione sadly took another sip on her drink hey i think i ll get something to eat do you want anything from the buffet hermione shook her and head and the next thing she knew harry disappeared in to the crowd and ron came out of nowhere hey ron hermione greeted having fun yeah ron said sitting beside hermione and asking for a drink lots of fun professor raptor just said this funny joke and is harry seeing someone hermione cut ron off before she could stop herself what ron brows furrowed harry seeing someone not that i know of then does harry have his eyes set on someone hermione must ve struck gold since ron eyes widened do do you know something that i know ron asked suspiciously i not sure she said looking at the counter surface grimly hermione do you still have that problem no hermione said blankly look i can tell it is the problem you told me earlier listen to me just tell him how you feel and you ll be okay harry and i will support you if he rejects you besides if a girl goes to him would you want to beaten by someone because of your fears i know hermione granger wouldntwant that ron was right why should she be scarred of harry rejecting her harry is a sensible person he wouldnthate for that harry might comment that he wants to be friends and it all over if he does have his eyes set on someone else then no way is she going to let that whoever that girl is go for her best friend first well hermione turned to ron i just realized how wise you can be hermione said and patted him on the cheek thank you hermione got out off her seat and looked went to the buffet to look for harry the crowd was filled with chatter and laughter while the music played overhead she wished the crowd would disperse a bit since her foot was stepped on twice before she finally reached the buffet table with two aching feet ouch i hate crowds hermione moaned while she bent over to massage the tip of her white heels hey hermione it was harry harry hermione stood up instantly trying hard to ignore the pain on her toes i didntsee you there what brings you here i thought you werenthungry said harry picking up a devilled egg on the buffet table and tossing it into his mouth mmm delicious it was now or never i just want to ask you something harry hermione said her heart and toes beating what harry asked and here comes the stuttering i i er want to woosh hermione and harry looked up and so as everyone else as a firework flew to the enchanted hogwarts ceiling the firework exploded into a shower of golden glitters they rained the whole great hall making it look like a shower hermione looked over at the place the firework flew out from and was surprised to see mcgonagall looking very angry while she held the ears of surprisingly fred and george weasley fred and george weasley mcgonagall hissed i should ve known hermione laughed they must ve heard of the new year bash and decided to visit hogwarts hey hermione hermione looked at harry you were about to ask something what is it i er i just want to say something to you at midnight yeah i want to say something to you at midnight she said exhaustedly sure harry said walking pass her and patting on her bare back since she was wearing a backless dress which made her shiver a bit great at least i know something will happen in midnight good evening everybody the vocalist kevin henry called to the crowd six minutes before january first is everyone having a good time said through the magicked microphone the crowd murmured in acknowledgement that good before we reach the new year i want to sing to you a song i wrote to someone special to me he sat down on one of the bar stools and held his acoustic guitar up and spoke at the microphone i call the song next year hermione rested her elbows on the counter of the bar as the band started playing and kevin henry started singing i not the first to say goodbye to a love i thought would never pass me by i not so good at giving in but i know that i tried my best and still cantwin hey hermione it was ginny enjoying yourself i see she giggled this was a great night the music great fred and george is here thought they have to be punished for what they ve done i hear they re doing the dishes and it only ten minutes till new year arent you going to give a kiss to someone hermione shot a look at ginny no not tonight i was supposed to do it but hermione replied drinking her fourth glass of grape juice feeling depressed that sad ginny said placing a placate hand on hermione shoulder who were you supposed to kiss her eyes widened is it seamus no hermione said briskly not him ginny oh good because kissing him with his recent hairstyle meh she smirked but next year i swear i ll be a better man with a better plan of breaking out of here but each time i ll find nothing changes but still say it been a good year hermione looked into her glass sadly should she do it should she ask harry now before any does it i have a feeling it the person you told me about last year ginny said it harry isn t hermione knew it was pointless beating around the bush yes i want to be the one to kiss him on midnight professor raptor and ron advised me to just do it i wontpretend to answer why we will never have a place we thought would be in time but i not angry anymore go do your thing do your thing i wonthold you back anymore i could do it but the problem i nervous and the other is that harry likes someone else where d you get that ginny asked new to this i overheard harry and professor raptor talking about it i convinced myself to tell harry my feelings first before he does to the other one but i very doubtful of my options but next year i swear i ll be a better man with a better plan of breaking out of here but each time i ll find nothing changes but still say it been a good year but that wontscare you would it ginny asked you like studying and you do it so if you like harry i know you can admit to him you like him and as we say goodbye the world we lost and what was taken away i think i have to say we are better off at living everyday the way we were and life i missing it everyday the way we were when life came now should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should auld acquaintance be forgot and days for auld lang syne it was almost like ron said ron and ginny couldntbe wrong could they they had good advice and if this helps then maybe just maybe she can take up her courage and kiss harry on midnight which comes in a minute the music stop all of a sudden as dumbledore came up the stage looking at all of the students and teachers another year of happiness gone he said i just want to thank you all for coming tonight i want to thank the teachers for setting the event and the band that gave our evening a musical event but alas we have only few seconds to live the year of ninety ninety six and welcome the next year which is ninety ninety seven our defense against the dark arts professor will take it up from here dumbledore left the stage as rapticon sr came up the stage with a standing ovation he nodded to them and picked up the microphone good evening everyone he said looks like we only have thirty seconds till the big one nine nine seven before we get there i just want to say that you better get ready for a new year kiss for your partners he smirked a new year tradition in the muggle world a great one i must say hermione then heard exciting murmuring amongst the wizards and witches a small fit of giggles could be heard from the hufflepuffs nearby yes yes mush all you want its gonna happen it a symbol on how much you care for one another we make a countdown then once we reach zero poof kissing time anywho thank you all for the support and hope everyone has a great new year rapticon sr left the stage with a round of applause but was cut short when fred and george shouted from the corner everyone twenty seconds then out of nowhere sparks flew out and formed numbers representing a countdown timer only fifteen seconds fourteen seconds thirteen seconds there was no turning back where harry hermione asked he at the buffet table near the punch bowl why are you gonna do it hermione just smiled and walked towards the buffet table as the crowd started chanting ten nine eight hermione found harry at the buffet table and was about to walk towards him but was surprised by peeves who zoomed out wearing a party hat counting down with the crowd hermione walked forward four three hermione was then blocked by a large group of ravenclaws who were trying to go to the people who they wanted to kiss two one happy new year hermione tried to move forward through the crowd of kissing ravenclaws but no way she could go pass them then fireworks started zooming out of nowhere forming amazing pyro techniques and sparks making the great hall flash in different colors while the band started playing auld lang syne finally the crowd dispersed and hermione was about to walk towards harry but stopped on her walk to see something that shocked her she was beaten by someone as expected a ravenclaw and what was more shocking that it was luna lovegood the sight of harry kissing someone was worst as getting a t in an essay hermione didntknow what to do she was late she felt like the saddest person in the happiest place in earth music was playing people were laughing she couldnttake it hermione walked towards the door of the great hall going to a place where she can drown her sorrows hermione felt the breeze ripple through her bushy brown hair as she leaned against the battlements of the astronomy tower distant music could be heard from the great hall while the occasional flash from fireworks appeared why was she so stupid she could ve gone to harry first but no she had to chicken out of it many times and taking double takes all the time and look where it landed her hermione removed the thought of her misery if harry caught her and alex kissing back at the quidditch pitch last september she knew that he would probably feel the same way the wind it nice hermione nearly jumped at the sound of harry voice she looked at him with pure sadness what was he doing here sorry i scarred you i was wondering where you were and ginny said she saw you leave i was thinking common room but knowing you well he gestured the horizon what eating you harry caught hermione grim face nothing i just exhausted harry leaned next to hermione on the battlements hermione didntknow if she should enjoy this or be sad about this i i saw you kissing luna a while ago hermione blurted out oh that harry scratched his head well luna asked and i accepted it was nothing though we are still friends luna even told me that she liked to kiss ron instead in a wave of relief hermione smiled so it wasntlove that made them kiss i know ron hinted that he might like luna too she giggled a bit did you kiss anybody harry asked no one i not keen on doing that i just want to be with friends and family that all no kisses she finished distantly hermione looked at harry who was smiling at her a very significant smile before hermione could speak harry took her hands and they both shifted to a standing position then harry said calmly with a smile three two one and for the first time in her life harry leaned and kissed her on the lips it was a shocking feeling but pleasurable hermione closed her eyes enjoying the moment they pulled apart and they looked at each other it kinda took me a lot of thinking to do this harry said turning a small shade of red i had a lot to think this through me too harry me too hermione said pulling him closer for another kiss a kiss that signaled that this year will be a good year they kissed as the distant singing of kevin henry sang the closing part of the song next year for auld lang syne my dear for auld lang syne will take a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne i not the first to say goodbye to a love that never passed me by read and review please i worked my off in this thing i want to know if it payed off not that i demanding it xx the writings on walls it was a day just like any other day that was what hermione thought it was a new day a day like any other day the same corridor she would pass every time she wanted to go to the library the same table she ate her food on at mealtimes the same common room she stayed every ten months a year yeah it was a day like any other day hermione walked down the corridor towards the library she hummed a tune while slightly swinging her bag which contained her school stuff hermione thought of the essay professor flitwick gave yesterday friday she was about to think what would do a good introduction on her essay when she saw the first thing that would make this day an unusual one she just passed by a portrait of three old men in white cloaks when she saw the most flabbergasted thing she ever saw the whole morning on the wall written in thick red ink was hermione loves harry hermione jaw dropped instantly the letters were bright and obvious enough for a passerby to see what was the meaning of this oh my merlin hermione gasped in disgust who would do such a thing she irritably took out her wand and pointed at it she muttered an enchantment to remove the writing on the wall but to no avail it was still there glowing with pride oh really hermione rubbed it off with her sleeve it didnt remove and as she rubbed harder and faster nothing was coming off hermione groaned in frustration they must ve used dr witdim all purpose permanent ink she cried rubbing her soar arm from the rubbing she heard footsteps and saw parvati and lavender walking into the corridor where she was at hermione eyes widened and slam her back against the wall obstructing the writing from view hello hermione lavender greeted happily off to the library hermione smiled a made a mere nod you seem stiff parvati said are you alright hermione loosened up so she wasntstanding like a suit of armor i fine really i am she said i just resting here oh okay well see you soon hermione lavender said as she and parvati walked down the corridor and disappearing from sight as they took a turn hermione leaned away from the wall and looked at the writing it was still there she looked around and saw an end table with a jar on top of it the jar was tall enough to hide the words hermione pulled the end table towards her and placed it in front of the words making it obscure from anyone there that ll hide it till i find the culprit who did this hermione took her bag and walked down the corridor and instead of going to where parvati and lavender went hermione walked forward which lead to the library she was already in the hallway where the library was when she saw the same writing of hermione loves harry on the wall right beside a suit of armor then another one on the other side of the wall and another one written on a door leading to an empty classroom hermione dropped her jaw and bag shocked to see many writings around her abandoning the thought of going into the library hermione rushes toward the door which lead to the empty classroom hermione shut the door behind her and taking a deep breath her eyes widened to see the blackboard written in the same red ink hermione loves harry hermione could ve screamed and ran for the loos to save the embarrassment how many have been written are they around the school if so then people would be pointing at her and staring at her when she goes public it would be humiliating what about harry what is his say in this does he know she needed to find harry and ron and get to the bottom of this harry hermione cried as she entered the common room all pink in the face after passing twelve hermione loves harry writings on her way to the common room harry looked up and from where he was sitting and smiled hermione what up d did you see what they wrote outside around the school hermione asked surprised at the fact that harry was smiling wrote what harry asked standing up then for the first time ever hermione blushed at the sight of harry the bloody writings must ve put an effect to her someone wrote something awful about us hermione said quickly cupping her cheeks with her hands to hide the blushes from harry what did they write harry asked slowly looking a bit cautious hermione bit her lower lip she was about to say what was written when ron came in through the portrait hole holding a piece of parchment harry hermione ron said suspiciously looking at the two of them hey ron harry said seriously hi said hermione in a high pitched voice ron looked at them thoughtfully and finally said you know it kinda strange that i find you two here because i was on my way here and saw this tacked on the message board right in front of the prefect bathroom he held up the parchment paper does this he unfolded the parchment he was holding mean anything he shoved it under hermione and harry noses to you guys hermione face exploded into pure redness as harry took the parchment paper and read the shiny red ink that formed into hermione loves harry who did this harry demanded to ron dont look at me ron shook his head i just saw it harry then shot a look at hermione did you know about this i i was about to t tell you harry hermione said hiding a part of her face with her book which she took out from her bag which was hanging on its strap on her shoulder why are you covering yourself with a book harry raised his eyebrows hermione put the book down revealing her red face i i i hiding my face because i was blushing she looked down it embarrassing you know it natural hermione said ron i blush when i get embarrassed but not that much but this situation isnteven that big oh c mon ron hermione said her face was getting red due to the thought of the whole school knowing about it anytime now i ve never blushed this much since the time i had to sit on harry lap on the knight bus since there was no space to sit the image of her sitting on harry lap on the knight bus two summers ago before their sixth year came to mind making her shake a bit wait said harry i thought you were fine with that if you said so i could ve just stood up while you sat down well my embarrassment took over me from my thinking hermione shakily said i kept on asking you if you were alright with you sitting on my lap and you just made a mere nod can we forget about it and get to the bottom of this hermione cried pointed to the parchment paper that said hermione loves harry on ron hand i just want it to end okay okay calm down said harry he made a low whistle lets do this then thank you hermione said calmly feeling a bit ashamed that she blurted the knight bus incident hermione swayed sideways slightly while her hands were on her back waiting for harry who was examining the parchment paper would they find the culprit hermione looked at her wristwatch to see it was already thirty minutes since she saw the first writing on the wall well the first we should do is find someone who owns dr witdim all purpose permanent ink with glitters said harry those type of ink are kinda rare glitters hermione snatched the parchment from harry grasp and looked closer on the letterings there were some shining dots which were indeed glitters that wouldntbe so hard would it said ron but how can we tell who owns one elementary my dear granger said harry in a very sophisticated voice we just ask them if they have one do you have one hermione ron asked suspiciously hermione shot ron a disgusted look why would i write these bloody things and give them out to the public hermione hissed sorry ron jumped backwards i was just asking no need to get shirty on me calm down hermione said harry why dontwe ask a gryffindor first hermione took a deep sigh alright but dontdo anything drastic okay sure said harry as he stepped out of the portrait hole with ron behind him and hermione following them hullo ginny said hermione ginny stopped on her tracks and turned to hermione who was accompanied by ron and harry hey guys ginny said smiling what up nothing much said ron eyeing the little redhead suspiciously we just want to ask you questions if it about the hermione loves harry stuff then dontlook at me i didntdo it said ginny oh really ron sneered you just assumed that you didntdo it or are you just amused at the whole situation hmm ron shut it harry spat ginny we just want to ask you if you own any dr witdim all purpose permanent ink of course said ginny i bought a couple of ink bottles last hogsmeade trip aha said ron grabbing ginny by the scruff of her neck we got you culprit ron hermione and harry cried in unison as ginny fought her way from ron grasp what said ron she admitted it she has the ink i didntdo it ginny shouted finally pulling away from ron and glared at him why would i do that to harry and hermione she hissed dont say lies ginny ron pointed at her ron that is enough said harry grabbing him by the shoulder she has the ink but is it glittered red hermione saw ron face turned red a bit he frowned and cleared his throat oh sorry bout that he looked down in shame sorry ginny you better be said ginny anyway said hermione what the color of you ink here you go ginny said taking something from her bag and tossing two bottles of dr witdim all purpose permanent ink to harry and hermione respectively hermione examined it and saw it was blue she looked at harry to see he was holding a black one nah said harry giving his bottle to ginny this isntthe one we are looking for we are looking for a red one with glitters on it said hermione handing her bottle back to ginny why dontyou ask parvati or lavender they have a fetish when it comes to different colored ink especially when they have those kinds of glitters thanks ginny said harry have you seen them i think they went to the library said hermione remembering meeting them earlier at the hallway i met them on my way there earlier lets go then said ron see you later ginny harry called after as they rushed toward the library hermione looked around checking if there are more writings she finds it a blessing that she didntrun into someone who will give a go at her and harry about the writings do you find it strange that we haventrun into someone who would want to have a say in this ron asked i dontwant to think about what would happen if we do said harry worriedly as they took a turn and stopped in their tracks to see the last person they wanted to meet draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins potter he called with a smug grin and my my my isntit granger he gave a look to his gang who sniggered hermione face turned red when she saw malfoy jab a thumb behind him on a tapestry that had the hermione loves harry words on it is this your idea of a joke said malfoy gee granger if you want to declare your love for scar head at least keep to yourself pansy parkinson a pug faced slytherin was snickering it so touching how you would do that would you even think potter would like you if he saw this she said shut up harry shouted why do i get this feeling you did this malfoy raised his arms and looked at crabbe and goyle pop quiz potter why would we write this he drawled i the most innocent man in the world your sarcasm is as good as your mother bony face malfoy ron spat malfoy face paled how dare you gave a go at my mum weasley he hissed you even had the guts to stand up for yourself even when you are nothing but a hermione grabbed ron by the arm before he could lunge at malfoy luckily malfoy stopped talking because someone just entered the corridor what goin on ere boomed the voice of hagrid malfoy looked at hagrid hagrid was a teacher after all and had the power to punish wayward students so mafloy thought best not to say anything so he nodded and left with his gang following at his wake why did you stop me again ron said to hermione i dontwant you to do anything stupid hermione replied hello hagrid said harry looking up at half giant hullo harry said hagrid i came ere tah see you an i think hermione too hermione had a feeling that she knew what hagrid wanted to say w what about hermione asked nothin i jus want tah ask if this is true he paused cause i was doin my daily gamekeepin duties an saw hermione love harry written on the front of me cabin someone wrote on your cabin ron asked hagrid nodded and frowned i not concerned about me cabin i can remove that with some of my formula i more concerned bout what was written on it look hagrid someone is playing a horrible joke on me and harry nothing is happening between the two of us hermione said really said hagrid well i hope you ll find the culprit don wan you two tah be in trouble if i find somethin i ll let you know hermione harry and ron bade hagrid goodbye and went for the library to find parvati and lavender fortunately the library was almost empty so hermione could walk freely without getting afraid of the fact someone might tease her they went around and found them sitting at the corner of the library you talk to them hermione said after malfoy i dontwant another blushfest alright said harry and nodded to ron hermione looked over to see harry and ron walked over to lavender and parvati hey girls ron said parvati and lavender looked up hello parvati said and looked at harry hey harry hermione knew what she was going to say harry lavender said have you seen the stuff outside library she smirked hermione hid her face as she heard harry voice yes that why i came here if you own an ink that goes by the name dr witdim all purpose permanent ink we dontown any of those but why dontyou ask dean said lavender he loves to draw so maybe he might own some of that stuff but i doubt he wrote well you know thank you harry said by the way where is hermione parvati asked she hiding at the common room malfoy gave a go at her and is now scarred at what will happen if the others did her ron replied that mean lavender said well will help we ll give you a heads up if we see anyone c mon parvati hermione heard footsteps coming towards her and saw harry and ron where d you think dean is ron wondered as they left the library hermione was already wondering where dean was when they turned a corner and saw the person they were looking for fiddling with something on the wall it was if he was writing something aha ron shouted making dean jump we got you now hermione was amazed as ron ran towards dean and tackled him down the ground oy he cried what the hell is this hermione and harry ran towards the two who were wiggling on the ground we caught you read handed dean ron said triumphantly standing up and grabbing dean by the arm parvati and lavender hinted that you might have one of those ink thingies what are you talking about dean said dumbstruck are you accusing me of writing those he pointed to another harry loves hermione sign on the wall on the walls by the looks of it yes ron said obviously we saw you writing on the wall and you were caught in the act ron was startled when dean started laughing why are you laughing ron demanded releasing dean from his grasp you thought i wrote that dean spoke with a smirk you got me wrong i was trying to remove it you see i was on my way to the bathroom and found this he gestured to the sign and of course you two he looked at hermione and harry being my friends i did a nice thing and tired to remove it with some thinner thinner ron asked it a liquid that is used to remove permanent paint on ones hands said dean a matter of factly trust me i was going to remove it but nothing happened when i used it there was a small silence oh well ron chuckled sorry for tackling you no need to dean waved a hand i know i would do the same ron and dean laughed look said harry would you give us a hand we need to find who did it so do you have any clue who did it well dean looked at the writing by the looks of how it was written i have a feeling someone from gryffindor wrote it i saw this handwriting before really hermione said who do you think it is not sure dean rubbed his chin slowly i need to investigate i think i ll go back to the common room and ask questions thanks dean harry said as dean left them at least we have some helpers hermione shook her head and the three began their search for the one who wrote the writings they searched the whole school asking questions from students who owns the red ink on their search they were offered help so now it seems they had their own detective squad the creevey brothers were much delighted than ever that they even taped parchment on their chests that said the potter detectives they found nothing so far and would receive lots of stares from many students hermione would just look down hiding her blushes we ve went everywhere hermione moaned as she harry and ron rested inside an empty classroom and i just receive four mean taunting she sighed i wish we would find the criminal who did this to me hey said ron you re not the one suffering harry is too you know yes but i the one affected that much because people think i the one who likes harry didntyou read the words yeah but harry has his share of humiliation right harry er harry ron turned to harry who was sitting on one of the tables he looked deep in thought what wrong harry hermione asked harry didntreply he was tapping his temple with his forefinger deep in thought harry ron asked silence then aha harry raised a forefinger in the air with a triumphant look making hermione and ron jump i think i know who the culprit is really hermione gleamed looking at harry how did you figure it out harry stood up and paced the area frankly i knew who did it ever since dean said it was a gryffindor there is no point beating around the bush then i must tell you who did it who ron asked anxiously tell us now so we can take care of the git who did it harry nodded took a deep breath and said hermione ron the one who have been writing those insolent words on our school walls is none other than hermione leaned forward to listen even more on harry brief but dramatic pause than who ron said also listening hard me harry said at once the words registered to hermione head what she said in shock that right said harry i ve been writing hermione loves harry all over the school you did that ron yelled in surprise b but why recently harry said in full confidence i ve been having feelings for hermione that it forced me to do that i canthold it in so i had to express my feelings it was the most unexpected thing hermione has ever had in her life why why would harry do such a thing oh my merlin harry hermione screamed why did you do that hermione was amazed that harry looked calm i ve been thinking about it the whole time hermione i not ashamed for it too he paused and made a smirk i love you the three words bore into hermione brain like a math equation her heart was pounding and her skin was sprouting nervousness it cant be true what did you say to me hermione gasped i said i love you harry repeated himself ever since last sixth year it was subconscious at first but now it whole very whole hermione looked from ron awestruck face to harry smug grin it was genuine she didntsee him that way but the fact harry a good looking person would like her made her realized the subconscious feelings she had for him well harry smiled hermione shook her head and looked at him again after a moment she finally smiled i will accept whatever you re offering to me but only in one condition name anything then in an instant hermione sweet and innocent face turned into that of an angry lioness i just want to kill you for getting me into a lot of trouble oh my you unleashed the beast ron gasped hiding behind the desk harry looked a bit frightened and without further ado he ran for the door and left the classroom come back here harry hermione screamed after him as she ran after him down the corridor and into the entrance hall ignoring the stares from other students and the hermione loves harry signs all over they ran into the lake and hermione chased him around the school as everyone watched in amusement so thus hermione learned the shocking revelation and realized as she was chasing harry somewhere around the third floor that it was a day just like any other day not knowing that it wasntjust a day like any another day but a day that is a special day like any other day she would have with harry in the future read and review please wow five effin days till half blood prince yey author note just like most fluffs this one is based on real life which was a conversation i had with my friend two weeks ago what my friend told me seemed so h hr i had to put it into paper but i was writing writings on the walls then so i had to wait xxi crush curiosity what do you usually do at friday nights back at your muggle home ron asked hermione as he sat beside her at the table in the corner of the common room that friday night i either read books or play cards with my aunties she replied glancing up at ron while she wrote something on a piece of parchment playing cards like gambling ron asked raising his eyebrows no i dontgamble a bad vice to follow hermione replied shaking her head okay ron paused looking at her write down stuff speaking of aunties how many live in your house hermione dropped her quill and rubbed her chin thoughtfully she missed home so much and only got to see it for two months only we live in a boarding house so i think six hermione replied looking at ron yeah it must be six well six in my flat while the others are in other flats ron nodded thoughtfully so you live in a large house with your extended family that pretty cool not all but most of them family gatherings are very very common and easy to come by which is something i really love said hermione smiling since i know what it feels like living in a big family i can tell back at your old muggle school things could get hectic ron said super hermione replied remembering the times she would hear the grown ups calling at the other children for school time and it was such a busy morning there was a slight pause after this what are you doing ron looked at the parchment she was fiddling with trying to she stuck a tongue out as she continued what she drawing down a line gain she dropped her quill more and picked up her parchment paper to see her drawing drawing skills she smirked and showed her drawing to ron what do you think ron nodded in agreement she was indeed good at drawing the drawing was that of a person kicking a black and white ball just like dean west ham poster what is it ron asked it more like who hermione said smiling at the picture and sighed david beckham is what they call him i first saw him when my cousins were watching football on television according to them he just started his career in the sport hermione was speaking in a rather distant and dreamy voice i have a feeling he might be a success eight years from now he was my first celebrity crush she blushed a bit crush ron chuckled i know you are my friend and all but would you trust me with that information he smirked at her it okay hermione waved a hand tugging the drawing in her bag i kind of open to my crushes if they asked to anyone yes she said except to my parents and relatives she bit her lip i dontwant them to go awed at me you see my folks know me as a someone who would never love and i wouldntfancy them making a fiesta about me having a crush it would make me feel bad in a way oh ron looked at her with pity i never knew you felt that way hermione giggled well it natural i had a crush on a boy once in school he was so good both physical wise and attitude wise hermione blushed ron was amused at hermione slight out of character does he know ron asked having his curiosity the best of him i think so she looked at ron with a sly grin do you make it obvious for him nope but there are instances that he catches me staring at him he even told not to be shy when i talk to him she was redder than the twilight sun hours ago speaking of crushes how many crushes did you have ron asked i think i had dozens the last one from my current one was er that person in ravenclaw allan george was it i think you know him the transferee ron raised an eyebrow i probably only know him by face but not by name he has fair complexion hermione nodded slowly i think but he is handsome but i over him hermione looked up thoughtfully before him was a that half japanese boy from hufflepuff adrian jao she said without nervousness his last name is pronounced as how by the way she added looking at ron puzzled look anyway before him was er lockhart she giggled and before him was the boy i talked about earlier that all i know at any rate wow and i thought i had the romantic world revolving around me ron made a low whistle smiling at her hermione smiled i have so many crushes she looked behind her cautiously and please donttell anyone i did and still have a tiny thing she made her thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart for harry ron eyes widened at the sound of this news hermione was already looking gingerly at him with her face very red as a tomato so the rumors are true ron said hermione gave ron a quizzical look that she said wondering nothing ron said quickly turning away what rumors hermione asked again seriously ron sighed and looked at the bushy brown haired girl you know when ginny teased you four months ago that had a thing with harry you kept on denying it hermione nodded at ron with assuring she knows that i have a crush on him but i keep on denying it since i dontwant to cause any issues let me guess ron leaned on his chair you dontwant harry to feel weird around you yes hermione said at once since when did you have this crush ron asked last sixth year hermione said softly running imaginary circles on the table surface do you enjoy it when you would help him in his studies hermione took a deep breath yeah i get opportunities to be close to him she licked her lip briefly are your feelings for him over then its not totally gone there is still a part of it but i dontget that much chances since my classes are not really the same with him and he busy with his n e w t s harry is busy he really does want to be auror doesnthe ron mentioned actually i so shy and nervous when i around harry these days hermione said shaking her head harry can be shy too hermione looked at ron of me not only you he shy to every girl he ever met with ron looked down oh she spoke softly and said after a long pause but then again i feel more close to harry throughout the years that i realized how much i care for him ever since i had feelings for him i couldntreally speak to him properly he always talks to me when he needs advice she chuckled he knows you have the stuff ron assured you give good advice after all thanks ron hermione placed a hand on his okay in your current status with him was there a moment that you were alone with harry and that you were happy about it said ron i never had an experience like that with my feelings for harry present but if there was one i think i wouldnthandle it very well how about last year hermione looked at ron raising an eyebrow what about last year you know when it was only you two going to hogsmeade and i had to stay because of some homework i had to do harry told you that already hermione asked in wonder well i asked him what happened after the trip and he told me that you and he were just walking around hermione blushed a bit and smiled actually we were accompanied by ginny i was really nervous when i thought it would be only the two of us thank merlin your sister was there to make things less awkward ron then made a cough and cleared his throat funny because if i can recall correctly harry said it was the two of you only the keyword is only no hermione blushed furiously the whole time ginny was with us but except that last time when we rode the carriages back to hogsmeade what happened after we did our sight seeing and shopping of stuff we thought it was time to go and harry and i rode the carriage together alone it was so embarrassing especially when i seated beside him and that i had a huge crush on him she sighed dont tell him okay sure said ron smiling promise i wonttell anyone what you said you can count on me thank you hermione replied but i just want to get over him you know i just want to lash it all out just like that she snapped her fingers ron looked at hermione with a significant look you know when my mum wants to let things out she d write them on paper he nodded it helps hermione gave ron a puzzlingly look sorry what i meant that ron took a brown notebook out of his bag and shoved it to hermione hands you write how you feel about harry in paper and in a way it would make you feel better it like taking something nasty out of your system i see hermione opened the notebook but i dontthink my feelings for him are nasty then they aren t if you want just draw hearts around harry name or something ron suggested but i not that kind of person hermione looked at ron i would never pour anything secretive in a notebook what if someone looks inside it hermione you just told me your love life so you can trust me on this i not stupid i ll keep it hidden or i ll just burn it on the fire hermione looked unsure but picked up her quill nonetheless would she really do this i think it will be more appropriate if i did this alone ron hermione inhaled and exhaled please ron agreed and left the table leaving hermione to her thoughts hermione looked deep in thought what would she write she wanted to write something meaningful and something that would let her feelings for harry get out of her system then like a firework hermione knew what to write it was long and simple she didntneed to think it through are you done ron went to hermione minutes later huh hermione glanced up and closed the notebook oh yeah i done she was smiling broadly and i feel much better now thanks for the advice she winked at him no problem ron patted her shoulder and took the notebook in his bag before hermione could speak someone came to them and to hermione surprise it was harry hey guys hey harry ron smirked and made a furtive wink at hermione er what up nothing really harry sat down beside hermione looking exhausted but i did saw malfoy getting in trouble by a teacher so i had to stop and watch priceless ron looked at hermione who was just smiling at him looking slightly dreamy it was amusing to him to see her like this i think i better be going said hermione standing up ron raised his eyebrows at her while she mouthed not now to him ron nodded okay see you hermione bye hermione waved at her two boys and climbed out of the portrait hole and out of sight harry shrugged and turned to ron hey ron have you seen my notebook which one ron sat on the empty seat hermione used to sit on a while ago you know my transfiguration notebook you borrowed from me awhile ago color brown and has my name on it harry said obviously oh that ron looked around his bag and took out a brown notebook here ya go thanks i need to study on that test tomorrow harry opened his notes ron left harry to his business and looked into his bag for the notebook hermione wrote on he was planning on throwing the page on the fire where is it he rummaged around the bag i know its around here somewhere then it hit him the notebook ron told hermione to write on was harry transfiguration notebook oh my merlin ron shot a look at harry and saw him reading his notebook with concentration is he reading whatever hermione wrote ron had this feeling that wasntthe notebook hermione wrote on he could have had another brown notebook ron double checked and started rummaging his bag like a tractor but the sound of harry serious voice would ve made an impact that would send ron flying through the window ron ron in dread turned to harry who was holding up the notebook which showed a whole page devoted to drawings of hearts some written text on the side and what seems to be a whole essay in the center of it all what is this he asked as he shoved the notebook under his nose er i i didnttell her to do it ron blurted out pushing the notebook away harry eyes widened her hermione wrote this harry demanded it pretty obvious obvious harry stood up ron does hermione like me ron started fiddling with his fingers not really er like you she has an er has an er sort of an affection towards you he paused and sighed like a crush some secret keeper you are ron ron glanced at harry who looked shocked at the news so harry looked at ron she likes me when there was no point hiding it ron thought since last year ron said quietly last year but did she get nervous or any of that then ron started explaining about hermione feelings to harry leaving out important details like how nervous she was with him and her past crushes it was already five minutes when harry looked at the notebook again ron was already wondering what hermione wrote harry ron spoke breaking the long silence harry slowly looked at ron well ron asked itching to know how harry felt harry opened his mouth but closed them he looked like he was trying to bisect a huge word into a sentence then afterwards he finally said so she been crushing on me ever since last year ron nodded wow harry raked his messy black hair that s unexpected didnt have a clue what are you going to do ron asked desperately what am i going to harry looked at the notebook again and started tapping it on his temple thinking i i need to talk to her that all talk to her ron shifted in his seat that would make her more nervous than before you re not going to say i just want to be friends talk right this comment made harry look worried well of course it just a crush if she was in love with me then i have a bigger problem harry said in a sort of panicky tone so what are you going to do now ron asked again i think harry paused and tore out the page hermione wrote on from the notebook and stuffed it in his pocket much to ron disappointment i need to have a walk friends first than studies especially when your friend is crushing on you without biding ron goodbye harry left the portrait hole leaving ron in an uncomfortable spot ron looked up at the ceiling and covered his face in frustration i suck big time he said to himself quietly unknown on what will happen to his two best friends the evening wind rippled through hermione bushy brown hair she looked up at the twilight sky thinking on what she told to ron and that she felt better that she said her feelings to someone at least that she can trust after that long talk she had with ron she needed some time alone and sitting by the lake was a good spot enjoying the sights hermione jumped and looked up to see harry sitting beside her he had some sort of smug grin on his face oh well um yes yes i am hermione spoke trying to keep her nervousness not obvious i can tell you are he held hermione shoulder making her shake a bit and feel red it seems like a month since i talked with you due to the n e w t s and all he released his hand from hermione making her feel comfortable again you know hermione smiled being busy and everything taking down notes and such speaking of notes harry said seriously taking out a piece of paper i saw this in my transfiguration notebook he unfolded the piece of paper and held it up in front of hermione and to her horror it was the essay she wrote about awhile ago shouldnt ron hide that first of all harry said getting it away from hermione reach as she tried to snatch it from him ron didntdo anything wrong i found out myself since the notebook you wrote on belonged to me there was no point now in hiding hermione blushed so much she thought she could explode and the wind started to make her cold it shivered her a bit in nervousness and secondly harry continued can you tell me how you fell in love with the boy who lived he smirked at her then hermione started stammering about stuff well i i er had some sort of explanation but harry cut her off by pressing his hand against her lips you know what you donthave to explain he smiled i ve been thinking about this a lot a while ago and thought that maybe i can give you a chance hermione would ve smiled but harry hand pressed against her lips isnt helping i know you want to be happy and i want you to be harry said moving closer to her so if this makes you happy than anything in the world then it was in the biggest shock of hermione life when harry dropped his hand from hermione lips and replaced it with his lips kissing her he pulled back and gave her the slyest grin he could ever make oh my merlin hermione held her chest which was rising up and down due to heavy breathing she was wearing a very wide smile but what made you think she looked at harry i had to think a lot through tea with someone he smirked hugging her just dontget in the way of my studies hermione pulled away and raised an eyebrow you studying that will only happen if malfoy becomes the nicest man in the world i can bet on that said harry from that day on harry and hermione became together which all started because of a careless red head who is right now in panic in the common room wishing he could undo what he has done well in my opinion i think he shouldntbecause he just did what he can never undo it back baby yeah i want reviews so i can carry on with my flagship fanfic ty d by the way thank you for all the reviewers for reviewing my collection even if it was under hiatus much appreciated xxiii smile harry left the dormitory a few minutes after waking up he surveyed the dormitory and saw the person he wanted to meet for the day hermione hermione harry called as he sat beside her hermione jumped at his sudden greeted and smiled a toothless grin i haventseen you yesterday at the train nor did i get to meet you last night during the start of term feast harry smiled so it looks like this will be the first time i ll be talking to you for the year hermione nodded gave harry a one armed hug and leaned her head on harry temple showing signs of platonic affection she pulled away and went back to her work harry smirked and saw what hermione was working on to his surprise it wasntschool related at all it was a magazine about wizarding entertainment at this point harry soon realized that he never checked out the entertainment side of the wizarding world apart from quidditch what that you re reading harry asked cue to this hermione took out her hanky and started coughing and she spoke with the hanky above her it a magazine ginny owns she said with a slightly muffled sound due to the hanky i am bored so i decided to read it for a second there i thought you were into those things harry leaned backwards on his seat haha that will be a story she said dropping the hanky tell me about it said harry as he turned to hermione i dontthink so said hermione then she laughed harry smirked but as hermione laughed he saw a glimpse of something shiny and obvious within her teeth what hermione harry leaned forward to her only to make hermione flinch and bite her lower lip is there he saw her standing up slowly something on your teeth hermione shook her head vigorously without keeping her eyes away from harry dont lie to me harry said standing up are you hiding something hermione then lifted her hanky over mouth and made forced coughing noises i am hiding nothing harry she said with another cough put down the hanky said harry hermione didntmove but looked at harry put he walked forward to her down he grabbed her hand the hanky it was surprising that hermione was resisting his hand she pulled away from him and backed up to a wall a couple of first years witnessed this and eyed harry suspiciously dont mind us harry said as he walked to hermione hermione he asked her kindly what are you hiding he could feel hermione arrest as she sighed and dropped her hanky she looked at him with guilt ridden eyes and smiled braces braces harry made a dry laugh is that what you re hiding stop laughing she squeaked as she flushed brilliant red i am not harry chuckled i just find it amusing that you re hiding something so freaky hermione finished you re smarter than that hermione said harry darkly tell me why are you hiding the braces i i she stuttered for once harry could see her red face give a shameful look he suddenly felt a surge of pity over her she probably didntwant anyone to know save it said harry waving his hand i know what it like when one doesntwant to reveal their reasons i am sorry this apology must ve been unexpected for the bookworm since her eyebrow was raised what harry asked you cantbe that empathetic can you she made a toothless grin you re so sweet harry scratched the back of his head and chuckled haha i am so empathetic it so pathetic he made a mock wince and continued when did you get them this summer she looked at her shoes i didnttell you because i not used to being pointed and stared at hermione harry shook his head it not as bad as you think he pointed at his scar see you re not alone he smirked causing hermione to make a toothy smile harry didntknow what happened the moment hermione flashed her smile her braces shined a bit thanks to the sun that shone from the window beside her giving this sense of angelic aura around her for the first time in his life he just realized how pretty she looked whenever she smiled he didntif it was the braces but dammit she looked very pretty with them wh what wrong hermione asked nervously frowning harry swore under his breath out of the guilt for looking at his best friend that way and wanting to see her smile again n nothing he stammered i i uh you were staring at me like you were in a trance she said is it the braces she looked at him anxiously no no harry said taking double takes at the current events i really like them i do really she gave him a soft look yeah he said shaking his head out of slight reverie um hermione what she looked anxious again can you er smile again what for her brow furrowed n nothing harry blushed i just want to see your braces what she asked incredulously why please he said in a serious tone i want to see something hermione looked taken aback she rolled her eyes and made an awkward smile there it is harry couldnthelp it she looked very cute with those braces on he couldnthelp but just adore her petite size her bushy brown hair her big chocolate brown eyes it felt like her smile opened him open it made him see what he couldntsee before why didnthe see it before you re scaring me harry hermione said as she looked at him with a scarred look he shook his head and looked at her he silently swore for doing that to her harry raked his black hair and sighed s sorry he said i didntmean to be so direct dont be hermione raised a hand at him i think you have your reasons too right she smirked y yeah harry nodded almost absentmindedly i do but can i ask you something she asked anything harry said hermione walked forward to him slowly and with a sudden move she flashed a smile making harry flinch why did you do that he asked feeling taken aback hermione didntreply she eyed him suspiciously and shook her head i was looking for something she said look let have breakfast harry nodded things are getting awkward now harry couldntstand it he didntknow what stopping him all he could think was hermione smile earlier that day and it driving him mad that he hasntseen it for the past few hours what wrong mate ron asked during free time at the side of the lake you look like you ve been spooked he chuckled harry rubbed his forehead as if his scar was hurting he looked at ron an looked back at the lake ron harry said yep have you seen hermione braces yeah she showed it to me a week ago said ron harry did a double take what harry voice rose to a shout hey hey ron raised his arms in defense what with the unexpected annoyance y you knew about them f for a w week harry asked darkly yes ron nodded why harry didntanswer he left ron at the lake and went back to the castle to find hermione why didntshe tell him about the braces she had them for a week a week ago was summertime so they must ve used owl post why didnt she tell him harry stormed into the library and walked pass students and madam pince the librarian he turned to a corridor and entered a room filled with chairs and tables there she was in her usual spot hermione harry said oh harry hermione waved dont oh harry me harry said annoyingly as he walked forward what hermione looked at him with confusion why didntyou tell me about your braces harry said as he walked beside her and held the back of her chair what are you talking about ah she cried as harry leaned the chair backwards a few minutes ago i asked ron if he knew about your braces he knew about it except that he knew it a week ago said harry he released his grasp as hermione yelped when the chair fell back to place look i can explain dont you trust me hermione harry asked looking at her eyes this morning you were hiding it from me he sighed you thought i would laugh at you hermione he shook his head i would never ever do that i am not accusing you that way hermione said as she banged the table surface i was going to tell you but but what harry bore into her eyes again you donttrust me it not that hermione cried then what is that harry roared making hermione jump in fear i canttell you stop yelling at me she said wincing you know how much i hate it when you yell at me harry paused really hermione nodded harry noticed her eyes looked watery this sight made harry guilt rise i i sorry harry said as his anger ebbed away i didnt mean to i know she wiped her eyes can you at least tell me an idea or something harry asked nicely if it so bad to hide it from me than from ron then it has got to be big i just can t okay hermione pleaded please just leave it that way harry walked up to her so close that his nose was an inch from hers please he said you can trust me i can help you this is your best friend the young bookworm blushed furiously harry felt affronted at this because she looked nervous and she was biting her lip very hard she kept on blinking furiously and took deep breaths harry brow furrowed and observed her sudden change of disposition well he asked hermione didntspeak she just kept on breathing heavily she kept on looking at his chin then back to his eyes harry never saw her so strange hermione harry put a hand on her shoulder surprisingly the moment harry touched her shoulder she took a step backward as if she was electrocuted harry raised his eyebrow at her while she took a gulp and blushed more hermione what wrong with you bam harry eyes widened with her nervousness her blushing and the constant hiding of her braces why didnthe see it before h hermione harry voice was shaky do i donthave a crush on you she squeaked as her face turned red as an apple hermione slapped her mouth as if she said a swear word harry looked at her in shock i i never asked anything about a crush harry said harry knew hermione realized her mistake since she slid a hand on her brown hair she was sweating a bit hermione harry asked again is there something you want to tell me he didntknow why but hermione ignored him and took a brisk walk towards the exit but harry instantly grabbed her by the arm and dragged her to his front hermione i going to be straight with you alright alright she said releasing harry grip from her arm hermione walked away from him while she covered her face he saw her play with her fingers and she turned on her heel and finally said harry she closed her eyes and opened them i think i have a crush on you harry felt a numb sensation on his stomach he gave her a shocked look ookay he said with a kind tone er how then hermione rubbed her temple and said does it matter i have a crush on you it driving me mad and i i canthelp but hide these braces from you is that why you re hiding it from me harry looked at her with a face of relief and disbelief i i thought that with these braces you might think i not very pretty she said weakly looking at the ground hermione harry didntknow what to say you are pretty it just that i never looked at you like that until this morning what do you mean she looked at him your braces he said with a sigh of relief huh she raised an eyebrow just smile said harry to his sudden revelation hermione made a slow nod as if she solved a mystery harry had the feeling she speculated that harry must ve liked her smile she did what harry asked and smiled there you go harry smiled looking at her very cute smile when i saw you smile ages ago i couldnthelp but see how pretty you were he blushed i had a feeling you were she said but i thought i was dreaming so i declined everything and went on to have my crush with the boy who lived well here we are he said indeed she said there was an awkward silence between them look it just a crush hermione blurted out i i know harry nodded as he took a step away from her i it just a crush hermione smiled and agreed yes that right she said awkwardly like can you imagine us going out on a date harry made a mock laugh i cantsee it he said and i am not trying to me too hermione said quickly it just a crush right harry chuckled nervously big deal true hermione said just a crush i can get over it you should harry said i will hermione nodded then at the same time the two made a eh sound from their lips harry didntknow what happened but it felt like hermione wanted to assure him that her crush on him will be over and that it isnta big deal harry put his hands on the back while hermione hopped on the balls of her feet they now had a very awkward silence i donthave a crush on you by the way harry said quickly i know hermione replied the two then looked away from each other er want to go check on ron hermione asked yeah harry said instantly h he probably has a funny story to tell then let go hermione said happily as she walked towards the door oh harry she looked at him t thank you for understanding she turned a shade of pink it means dont worry about it said harry let go then she smiled flashing her braces at him hermione went ahead and left the area harry smirked and saw she left her book being the generous man that he is harry picked it up and started walking wha harry stopped on his tracks and saw a letter fall out of the book it was a short note he picked it up and with a glance around the place he looked at the letter and read dear hermione i am in a major crisis i donthave a crush on harry anymore good news bad if you tell me i think i in love with him well you too since i writing to myself sincerely hermione from a week ago p s keep this away from everyone a surge of electricity ran across harry nervous system her crush and braces was a pseudo scapegoat this is the one she been hiding from him all along why else would she not contact him for weeks she must ve written this out of going crazy over him harry remembered how he was insanely in love with cho that he wrote letters to himself telling that he should find a way to kiss her harry slipped the note into the book hermione ancient runes book and closed it he stared into space and pondered what he just discovered harry harry looked behind him and saw hermione y yeah he said in a dry sort of voice you know i cantgo to ron without you right she smirked what hermione said felt like a double meaning to harry he looked at her in a new light she was in love with him he kept her book out of sight under his robes are you coming she asked was he going to tell her that he knew sure harry said and together they walked out of the library with sudden high spirits hermione was smiling as they walked to the common room harry just looked at her thinking how that smile of hers will ever make him reveal that he knows about her secret harry looked at her and glanced at the book he looked at the sky and thought hermione has a lot of explaining to do climbing the stairs with hermione he couldnthelp but think that on his first day of the term he would find a single smile albeit dressed in braces so meaningful in his life read and review fluffateers loosely based on a true story that i witnessed in a third person point of view xxvi study buddy five essays in one week hermione irritably told off many first years that night to shush because she needed all the concentration in the world to finish these five essays the common room been buzzing for the start of the easter holidays and the only person who hasntbeen joining the holiday spirit was gryffindor brightest witch the nerve of them she hissed under her breath as she continued to write the fifth paragraph of her essay honestly canta person get some peace around here hermione said the familiar voice of harry not now harry i busy she rudely spat without glancing at him s sorry the sound of harry anxiousness forced hermione to look up at him i i didntmean to what she said in a kind voice sorry harry i just need to do this i just want to ask a favor that all harry said nervously trying to keep on hermione good side well whatever it is harry hermione lectured him wryly i hope it doesntinvolve getting a slytherin under my prefect wing no harry exclaimed it not that and what is it harry cantyou see i busy she sternly crossed her arms she wasntkeen on getting the famous harry potter to make her linger any longer it this okay harry said in a halfhearted and weak tone as he showed her a piece of parchment hermione surveyed it and saw that it was an essay i i need you to oh harry hermione rubbed her eyes tiredly will you ever learn she then shot him a matter of factly look i sorry but if you keep doing it this way you ll never ever learn hermione kept her eyes on harry who was fumbling with the parchment idly while he winced in slight shame but no hermione said finally feeling both guilty and satisfied that she is telling him off harry eyes shifted away from her which made hermione insides hurt with guilt for her it was very hard to see her best friend act this anxious but why is there something else hermione asked keeping her voice even i never mind harry sighed in a disappointment look no hard feelings alright now i know anyway see ya before hermione could say something harry turned on his heel and left her wow hermione winced uncomfortably is it me or did i do something wrong she shook her head he ll turn up soon he smart i wonthave to worry about him without hesitation she continued her work at ease you re looking really peachy today said ron as hermione sat down with him in the great hall peachy hermione smirked at him er never mind ron chuckled i picked it up some where anyway why are you looking all happy today i finished all my essays last night she said happily now i can enjoy the holidays that wicked news hermione ron smiled looks like you also took care of harry right hermione looked at ron suspiciously what harry she asked wait ron said slowly as he dropped his fork on his plate didnt harry meet you last night hermione bit her lower lip er yes he came up to me but i kind of she felt her guilt rising i kind of shooed him away and told him off that he should learn to do his essays alone or else he ll never learn why is there something i don t know aww hermione ron said in realization as he scratched the back of his flaming red hair i you dontknow what hermione asked desperately what there to know that i dont know ron took a deep breath hermione harry kinda flunked what hermione shouted making the great hall almost silent luckily the students reverted back to their business before hermione could continue he flunked when what subject transfiguration ron said sadly he been distracted by a lot of things lately you probably didntnotice but he fell asleep on the big test last week he couldntsleep last night hermione guilt bubbled to a fever pitch what did mcgonagall say she asked with a high voice which usually comes when she nervous harry told me that mcgonagall will pass him until he keeps up with the extra work she has given him before the holidays started ron explained while biting off a sausage she told harry to go to you if he needed any help hermione hid her face behind her hands no wonder harry was so anxious looking last night he wanted her to help him in his essay since he really needed her right now but why was he nervous in asking her wasnt he always asking her to help him in essays it been a really really long time since he asked me to help him in his essay though and it really has been a long time come to think of it it always been ron who been asking about a helping hand hermione groaned and dropped her head on the edge of the table muttering how a bad friend she is hermione are you alright ron asked looking at her in concern i fine ronald hermione said stifling her guilt i just need some air where harry i haventseen him but he still at the dormitory when i last saw him i reckon he sleeping right now ron said as he dipped three eggs onto his plate why i have to talk to him hermione said and left the great hall without a word to ron why am i worried harry never been this lazy i cantbe too worried can i he will never learn if i help him too much but he flunked he needed my care and i slammed the door in his face grrr i hate myself for that a few minutes later she reached the common room and fortunately harry was there writing an essay among a pile of books about transfiguration the strangest sensation of wanting to cry at this made hermione feel weird in the brain what was she thinking h harry hermione asked nervously harry stopped writing to look at her and nodded acknowledging her presence he went back to writing afterwards i i see you re working hermione said walking towards him look hermione harry said i know what you said last night and i understand he stared intently to the open book in front of him hermione had the impression that he wasnteven reading anything you want me to learn how to work things out for myself i know harry hermione cut him off before she could stop herself harry stopped and made a gulp what he looked at her i know she said emphasizing the last word ron told me r ron is making things up harry said as he unrolled his parchment while he scratched his nose hermione noticed that he didnteven go halfway with his essay harry hermione said kindly as she held his hand to stop him from unrolling his parchment dontlie to me ron told me why you came to me last night you er flunked transfiguration she winced hoping harry wontblow up at her harry chuckled and pushed his glasses up to the bridge of his nose he opened his mouth closed it again and then stared away from her harry why were you nervous to ask me last night why didntyou tell me i could ve set my work aside and helped you hermione clarified frankly i feel devastated about this i willing to help alright she said kindly as she stroked harry hand i was nervous to ask you harry said quietly because to be honest as much as i know mostly everything about you i dont really know where you stand with the whole homework thing harry then forced a nervous chuckle i afraid to ask you so i usually let ron do the asking harry then looked at hermione with his green eyes hermione frowned sadly at him he was always kind to her she knew he meant well harry hermione smiled i dontknow what to say but you can always ask me i just had a hard time last night with the holiday homework i was hoping i d have a free holiday i sorry i was shirty on you it alright harry said you know i somehow wished we d write our essays together last night he added oh hermione looked at him surprisingly i i never knew that she chuckled so you need help how about breakfast i can skip that for you she smiled let begin shall we harry nodded i just cantreally understand this thing about transfiguration spell he pointed to the book it took them an hour to master the spell of transfigurating a book into a bird and a half hour to write an article about its effects and tell if it can help the wizard society today while explaining why you answered yes or no for the whole time hermione made harry do most of the work she just explained to him what this meant and which is which so far she never touched harry essay so that way he can learn to do things on his own while she coached him what things meant to give him a better understanding you re doing great harry hermione said as the morning was about to end she was looking over his shoulder while he wrote his sixth paragraph i proud of you hermione caught harry smirk and she felt a glow of admiration towards him she sighed and slightly leaned her chin on his shoulder oh harry gasped as he made an ink blot on his parchment damn he swore under his breath here hermione stood up and reached for her bag you can use this she took out a rubber eraser that had the size of a large chocolate bar it an instant ink blot remover i got from hogsmeade last year thanks harry nodded as he took it from her he started rubbing it firmly when hermione interrupted no no no harry she laughed do it lightly like this she grabbed harry by the hand and moved his hand lightly along the parchment hermione didntknow what was happening but she could sense harry breathing on her neck she saw that the ink blot disappeared and all was left was harry essay she smiled and put down the eraser just take it lightly alright hermione looked at harry harry smirked at her and nodded i ll keep that in mind he said harry continued his writing while hermione watched him do his essay you donthave to be here when i dontneed you you know harry said i ll just call you if i need you no i rather worry about you than my first day of the holidays she explained while resting her elbow on the table besides i still have six days to enjoy it same can be said for you she smiled at him warmly harry looked at her and they both shared a smile you know harry said i never realized it but writing a thorough essay is a lot of work now you know how i work my essays hermione said i look at every page and read every word so i can have an easy path to make my point across before hermione could continue harry said thank you hermione for everything he said and looked at her well with the whole helping me and ron with our essays in the past and being a great friend you re welcome she replied to him with a grin it was quiet for the time being before harry started talking again i have to be honest hermione harry said in a voice of unusual reluctance recently i have been keen to spend some time with you really hermione asked startlingly yeah he said pausing on his work i figured that since i always spend time with ron why not spend time with my other best friend hermione laughed you re so sweet she said but you really donthave to c mon hermione harry said mostly i only talk to you about normal things when i have a crisis in my life or when i need help in school there are times why i want to know why you idly groom a strand of your hair sometimes and why you re quiet at times or what your favorite color is or what flower do you enjoy looking at that stuff i er want to know what you think about in life you re very likeable for that i have to admit hermione didntknow why but she blushed wow harry er thanks for appreciating that but you know you can always talk to me about er normal stuff any time she smiled it doesnthave to always be when we help each other at schoolwork or when you have a problem just come up to me and we can talk she finished rather lamely harry smiled at her which she returned and blinked at him tenderly for the record harry i enjoy looking at lilies hermione gingerly said haha harry replied i kind of figured that when i saw you having a fancy in staring at the field of lilies near the burrow last year that me hermione sighed sue me she giggled what seemed to be almost fifteen minutes it wasntlong enough before harry finished his essay done harry said i done he repeated after realizing it great job harry hermione rubbed his bicep and hugged him from behind i knew you could do it i couldntdo it without you harry said as hermione released her grasp and sat on a chair beside him you helped me a lot today no problem hermione smiled remember you can ask me anything you want just make sure you do it yourself alright dont worry i ll not get that out of my mind he said thank you hermione he pulled her to a hug i really appreciate it i here hermione said to harry kindly as she pulled away from him i ll always be she said come on lunch is ready and i really starving a week has passed since the easter holidays fortunately harry essay got a high mark of outstanding from mcgonagall and his practical test just saved him some time to boost his grades in transfiguration even further he seemed to be in focus with himself recently that whatever the mystery behind his sudden distraction the past week before easter didntmatter to hermione all she wanted to know was that harry is happy on a side note hermione has gone back to study mode as she prepared herself for a humungous quiz in ancient runes she cantremember the last time she had to memorize something this long hermione didntwant to publicly admit it but as much as she loves learning she had her own share of boredom with studying and tonight was one of them but she really wanted to ace the test her grouchy attitude went back to full scale as she hissed a couple of second years who were laughing out loud at the corner of the common room to keep quiet it like last week again hermione complained as she read a list of ancient magic runes from egypt concentrate hermione just concentrate hermy hermione stopped reading and looked up to meet the eyes of harry he was standing behind the table she was using to study his hands were behind him while he stood still as if he was going to be in trouble harry i very busy hermione explained can we talk later ever since mentioning it to him harry and hermione has been talking a lot about normal things in life like how they lived in muggle lives and that sort tonight wasntthe time i i know but harry hermione said if it about the charms essay i already told you ask me when i not too busy i know hermione harry said but was cut short in mid sentence we ve been through this you were able to do the transfiguration essay which is harder than the charms essay you can do it i know you can hermione i sorry harry i have to take this test tomorrow it not just like a week ago hermione put her foot down calmly and said no she felt more comfortably saying this to harry since she understood him a lot more than ever it only best that you learn to do things by yourself by now it not that hermione he said fretfully then what is it hermione asked irritably harry then made a slight grimace in his face and looked at hermione took a deep breath it just that i have something to tell you something important he said as he clutched a large lily behind his back while a clueless hermione surveyed his unusual stance read and review ii chicken pox for the bookworm soul harry reviewed his move if he decided to move the bishop ron might have a chance to capture his queen which leaves harry king protected move ron said in near stupor dreading what will happen next harry took his bishop and moved it three squares diagonally blocking his king from harm way then checkmate ron said triumphantly as he placed his castle seven squares away from harry king i win harry arched his eyebrows in disbelief as he looked at the results ron was right he lost i dontget it said harry his eyes on his king practice mate said ron fixing the chessboard practice harry sighed in defeat as he looked around the common room it the christmas holidays and everyone except for harry ron hermione ginny neville and the creevey brothers went home for the holidays two days before christmas day and harry decided to test his skills in chess to see if he gotten better but he now saw that he didntget any better dammit said harry in a hush voice as he stood up and stretched his arms before i close this board want another round ron asked grinning as he held the chessboard open nah said harry then they heard someone coming down the staircase behind them it was hermione she looked disgruntled as she scratched herself irritably while she started mumbling stupid rashes she mumbled irritably walking to them since when do i scratch myself nonstop she added sitting on the couch nearby ron and harry er when you are itchy nonstop ron said unsure of himself ha ha very funny ronald hermione said scratching her neck harry looked closely and saw faint red spots on her neck but not just on her neck her cheeks her forehead behind her ears everywhere hermione said harry walking to her and sitting beside her you have er spots on your face what hermione asked confusingly spots on your face harry said as he pointed to the full body mirror at the other end of the common room check it out hermione got off the couch and walked to the mirror harry then saw her face in the reflection of the mirror her mouth dropped as she gasped loudly what is it ron asked looking at her she turned to them looking shocked i i have the chicken pox she cried the chicken what ron said unknowingly chicken pox said hermione biting her knuckles nervously harry noticed she was scratching them with her teeth it a viral disease that only occurs she put her hand down and started scratching her shoulder in your childhood and since i never had chicken pox she scratched her waist since i was one day old it looks like i have it scratch my back weasley she bellowed alright ron said standing up and started scratching hermione back as hermione bit her tongue in satisfaction oh she said that better is it really that itchy ron asked scratching her back gingerly yes said hermione then harry saw her biting her lower lip guiltily oh i forgot scratching is discouraged you can stop it ron ron stopped and rounded her till he was on front of her with harry beside him are you feeling alright ron asked harry saw hermione calming herself down as she let her hands stay at her sides harry noticed her eye was twitching by the way said hermione moving slightly due to the itchiness have any of you experienced chicken pox i dontrecall having an itchy extravaganza said ron harry hermione asked the dursley locked me in a cupboard and when dudley got the pox i stayed there till his disease subsided so that a no hermione asked worriedly yup said harry oh no hermione said staring at the fire helplessly what wrong ron asked looking at harry it means that we are likely to get the pox too since chicken pox is contagious said harry dontworry it a once in a lifetime opportunity he added does that mean we have to stay away from hermione till she gets better ron asked i afraid so hermione said dontworry ron i ll be alright you ll still see me except only farther and i think i should sleep in the common room then why ron asked because i know that neville and ginny have no chicken pox since there magic parents use magic i however donthave magical parents she added rather disappointingly how about colin ron asked he here too so is his brother he doesn t harry said he blabbed it to me years ago his brother doesnthave it too it looks like i have to be isolated for the whole holiday hermione said in sad sarcasm merry christmas to me she added irritably i think you two should go now before i sneeze because that how the pox spread ron grabbed harry by the wrist and pulled him up the boy dormitory harry i worried we cantjust isolate her like this ron said as he sat on his own bed but it will only be a month i think said harry remembering how long it took him to stay inside his cupboard when dudley had his chicken pox bummer said ron its christmas and what will hermione do if we are gonna celebrate it with her when she twelve feet away from us i dunno said harry looking out the window i think that what she wants i guess harry went down to the common room that night carrying pillows bed sheets and a blanket that came from the vacant beds of the ones who went home for the holidays he went down slowly and entered the common room to see hermione now sporting red spots on her face reading a book on the couch his presence made her look up and said harry she asked as harry put the stuff he was carrying at the opposite side of the couch what are these for since you are sleeping here i think its best that you need to be comfortable as possible said harry hermione gave him a warm look aw harry you re so sweet she said as she stood up but paused when she said i would like to give you a hug but you know my pox harry smiled and said just have a good rest thanks harry christmas eve came and harry was all but happy when he saw hermione sleeping on the couch as he came down from the common room with ron do you think we should wake her up ron asked harry carefully prodded her awake but she just groaned and muttered i ll be up later mum which made harry and ron decide to go down to the great hall for breakfast hey harry said neville as harry and ron sat down in the half empty gryffindor table since everyone left for the holidays only neville ginny and the creevey brothers were the only ones at the table the other houses had the same number of students and unfortunately malfoy and his cronies stayed for the holidays hey neville ron replied as he helped himself with christmas ham we saw hermione at the common room ginny said frowning i hope the pox would go away then cue to this hermione came in the great hall she sat down at the most opposite side of the table away from harry and the others poor thing said ginny as hermione started eating with a look of loneliness neville ron and ginny started talking about what type of gift they would want for christmas i wish i had that self watering plant pot for my mimbulus mimbletomia said neville excitedly i wish my sweater was anything but maroon said ron i think a necklace wouldntbe so bad said ginny harry looked at hermione with concern she was holding her goblet of pumpkin juice with two hands as she took a swig of it the image of her eyes looking around just above the goblet rim made harry look at her with pity harry what are you doing ron asked as harry stood up look its christmas he looked at ron and the others with a face full of concern and if we can enjoy it hermione can too without waiting for an answer from the others he walked to hermione harry hermione asked as harry placed his plate of food and goblet across from where she sitting what are you doing here you might get the pox let say that there is this guy who doesntlike to die till his friends are all happy harry said grinning hermione gave him a quizzical look what do you mean you rather get the pox than see me like this harry nodded sipping into his soup he looked up and saw hermione giving him a warm look a very warm look thank you she said as if she was about to cry of joy harry ron ginny and neville decided to have a small but fun snowball fight it was very intense as the creevey brothers cheered on ha oomph ron gasped as he was cut off by a hurling snowball by ginny harry laughed and when he looked from afar he saw hermione watching them from the open double doors of the entrance hall harry waved at her and he knew she saw him because she waved her hand in a cute manner she then turned on her heel and left frowning harry dropped the snowball he was holding and started following her harry where are you going neville asked before he received a snowball shot from ron who started doing a jig i ll be right back said harry waving at them as they continued the snowball fight harry climbed the grand staircase and he already called out the password when he reached the seventh landing to the fat lady the portrait swung open as he clambered in to see hermione reading she smiled giving harry the impression she acknowledged his arrival she closed her book and looked up so she said crossing her legs forming her sitting position to an indian sit on the couch how christmas anything but horrible said harry walking to her as he held her chin while hermione looked up at him say ah hermione opened her mouth with an ah showing her mouth insides harry took out his wand and muttered lumos as he checked her like a doctor would do you seem to be fine said harry nox hermione closed her mouth and smiled at him er why did you come up here i dontwant you to be lonely said harry sitting beside her but what if you get the pox said hermione worriedly then i would have it harry gave her a grin hermione bit her lower lip as she hugged harry very tightly she looked at harry with her arms still around him there faces were very close you re such a good friend i so glad the boy who lived was my first ever best friend she said harry smiled then he raised an eyebrow when hermione was giving harry a dreamy look i love your eyes she said her face moving closer it gives the christmas feel though she added after a long pause harry and hermione pulled away and slightly blushing harry squeezed hermione knee and told her to take a nap which she did before he stood up on the dinner before christmas harry decided to bring food up to the common room while hermione was still asleep harry entered the common room to find her napping on the couch in front of the fire the warm glow that surrounded hermione made harry see hermione soft features even more accentuated he moved forward to her placed the food on the coffee table nearby and sat beside on the little space on the couch harry stroked her soft cheek with the back of his finger and gently moved a strand of hair to the back of her ear harry looked at her and remembered the times when she would comfort him in the hardest of time and now harry the one doing it to her she was with him ever since harry watched as hermione stirred and slowly opened her eyes she looked at harry and smiled i thought you went to have dinner she asked groggily rubbing an eye with her left hand is there something wrong nothing peculiar said harry giving her a soft peck on the lips hermione turned a small shade of red but she smiled casually as if this happened on a regular basis merry christmas hermione said harry tucking the sheets under her so she could be warm merry christmas too she replied yawning and holding his cheeks with a very sleepy but dreamy stare if this was a dream i wish i wouldntwake up harry smiled as he took her hand and kissed her knuckles gently and putting them under the sheets dontworry hermione you won t with a nod hermione went to sleep harry stood up and walked up to the portrait hole before he could climb out he felt an itchy sensation on his arm while he scratched it fanfiction within a fanfiction xxx sans rule 34 harder hermione yelled at harry harry thrust forward swiftly harry felt a tingling sensation in his arms as he felt a bit tired holding them up a bead of sweat dripped down his face as he felt his face feeling hot come on harry said hermione panting as her voice carried across the darkening dusk just a little further harry harry suddenly made another thrusting movement making hermione squeak in surprise that it she breathed yes faster harry moved forward and backward and after a few minutes of reiterating his movements he felt the energy being absorbed from his body as he glanced at hermione oh god hermione muttered harry smirked and after one final thrust with force harry hermione cried opening her mouth slightly crack the thick piece of log split into two as the two held their side of the saw feeling breathless harry craned his neck to see the two pieces of split logs hermione wiped her face with a lacy handkerchief as harry walks over to their newly chopped logs and tosses the two pell mell to a rack of logs you should ve said that it was about to cut through said hermione pointedly it gave me quite a shock really if i did you would ve slowed down harry replied smacking his dragon hide gloved hands together repeatedly got the job done quickly see harry smirked at her teasingly which she replied with a scoff of mock irate but returned harry smirk with a grin is that the last of them asked hermione looking around the backyard i think so said harry where is ron anyway harry and hermione realized they ve been doing this task without ron for an hour ever since he excused himself for bowel movement earlier hermione reckoned to harry that ron probably tired himself out after those packs of logs fell on him earlier in the afternoon harry reminded himself on ron abhors towards working without magic it was summertime in the burrow and it been four days since harry and hermione arrived unsurprisingly ron mentioned this to them prior to their arrival in his letters the lack of weasleys around the house led to mrs weasley asking harry and hermione if they can help around with the chores in the burrow mr weasley has been toiling in the ministry due to numerous complications regarding numerous healing potions that would chomp off one nose bill and charlie were in their respective jobs abroad while fred and george attended to run their joke shop only appearing in night occasionally because of this ron ginny and mrs weasley are usually the ones who are in the house for the whole summer harry and hermione gladly accepted the offer to help around the house which proved to be quite fun for the next few days today chore was to chop wood for the log rack in the backyard mrs weasley would ve allowed them to use magic to get the job done but since harry wontturn seventeen until the thirty first of july to be of age to do magic mrs weasley reckoned to ron and hermione that they would help chores without magic to give harry some sense of equality morality learning mrs weasley would call it here said hermione tossing a water bottle to harry which he took a swig without hesitation hermione sat on the grass and leaned against the tree stump that they ve been using as the base for their woodcutting i tired she said quietly taking a gulp of her water harry smiled and sat beside her i tired too said harry wryly you want to go in and tell mrs weasley we re done now hermione shook her head and said while looking up at the orange tinged sky no i just want to relax a bit before moving she winced as she rolled her shoulders my arms hurt from all the sawing never knew you were that strong said harry drinking his water there are many things you dontknow about me said hermione smiling at him well not really maybe a couple of things you dontknow about me but there you go harry laughed and the two relaxed as the sun started setting away from st ottery catchpole you think ron will be back said hermione looking at the half sun disappearing beyond the hills doubt it said harry mimicking hermione but he missing the view oooh yes hermione shifted on her seat it been awhile since i ve seen the sunset harry stared at hermione eager disposition it just occurred to him how amusing it was seeing her act dreamily towards the sunset come to think of it the sunset was indeed beautiful have you ever had those weird thoughts when you were a kid harry hermione asked conversationally what do you mean you know she said drawing circles on the grassy lawn like how you had always thought people were inside television sets or how babies are made through kissing why are you asking that harry asked looking at hermione peculiarly it was strange for her to ask these but it was probably for her own curiosity nothing said hermione turning slightly pink i just wanted to know more about your childhood that all harry stared at her she smiled weakly back at him giving him the notion that she just wanted to pass the time talking about things and na ve childhood beliefs was the perfect ice breaker fair enough said harry well i always thought that the world was flat and that if we were to sail to the end we will fall really said hermione laughing quietly yes said harry also i was afraid of touching a globe of the world why is that dontlaugh alright said harry smiling to himself gingerly er i was afraid of touching the globe since i thought that if i touched it he paused and chuckled my finger would probably kill the inhabitants on the corresponding country that i touched he bit his lip to keep a nervous laugh from escaping okay said hermione at once you re officially the best boy i ever met hermione then broke into fits of giggles the embarrassment of harry ebbed away as he surveyed hermione laughing state it felt a bit amusing and affronting for her laugh at his thoughts but then again the thought of killing people through a globe was pretty stupid glad thing you found it funny said harry derisively oh harry dontbe such a spoiled sport said hermione jokily i just found it delightful about knowing that you can be mad too yeah said harry says the one who thinks babies comes from kissing i was five harry said hermione in a matter of factly tone i could ve thought about anything farfetched i understand that but you do know where babies come from eh he said jokily grinning hermione threw him a serious look of course i know she said then she straightened herself up as if she was in a class lecture and continued according life and science iv the human image that was my fourth grade textbook in muggle school by the way human beings procreate through means of reproduction alright alright harry interrupted her getting red in the face for almost engaging into this kind of conversation with hermione i i get it i get it harry you cantpossibly think sex is all naughty talk can you said hermione sternly an uneasy bulge grew in his throat he really felt uncomfortable at this question he knew that hermione was a smart girl and her views on these kinds of things are more objective than subjective n no said harry feeling ashamed i i sorry it just it awkward talking about it with me she asked kindly yeah said harry quietly turning slightly red i just not comfortable talking about it let just change the subject okay sure harry said hermione rolling her eyes and smiled at him we can talk about other stuff instead of procreation haha very funny harry chuckled and pushed hermione jokingly on the shoulder making her almost lose balance on her seat hey hermione protested as she repositioned herself on her place you re the one going on about it going on about what said a voice behind them harry and hermione quickly wheeled their heads around to see the tall figures of fred and george behind the stump they were resting against the two were tall red headed adults in their late teens who owned their own joke shop they were identical in every way down to the last freckle fred had his foot propped up on top of the stump while he grinned at the two and how are the chores doing children fred asked with an air of mockery george and i fancied a little visit for the family you know he rested an elbow on his knees checking if things are still intact and that you three arentdoing any more mischief by the way fred looked around where our baby brother in the house said hermione pointing to the burrow fred and george were about to take a move on when george said oy hermione hermione looked at george harry followed her gaze and saw a fraction of george tossing a magazine to hermione harry noticed it was a very old magazine of witch weekly something about the cover where a curly haired witch who was smiling toothily while pointing to a sponge cake with her wand made harry recognize it oh my god hermione gasped where did you get this we went to their headquarters the other day for an advertising deal and we ran across back issues and we spotted that specific issue because george winked at harry there something that might interest ya oh well said fred conclusively patting the shoulders of harry and hermione we ll be off to greet our dear mum see ya the two entered the burrow where they met the greetings of their mother harry surveyed the burrow kitchen windows where a busy mrs weasley was fiddling around the kitchen preparing for supper harry looked back to hermione and saw her opening the magazine it looked as if hermione knew this article since she turned to a page instantly without searching for it but like hermione harry let out a quiet gasp hermione had her eyes fixed on a familiar article he had read years ago during his fourth year isntthat the article that skeeter woman wrote regarding hermione being a scarlet woman to you and viktor yes harry you re quite right said fred enthusiastically funny though he bent forward so he his head was level to hermione s the moment we apparated here we thought we heard the word procreation oh shut up said hermione irritably as she flicked the magazine page it was just a mature discussion maybe less of mature if viktor was around wontit said george impishly appearing on harry side grow up you two spat hermione glaring at them you do know that the article is complete rubbish dontyou of course we do said fred winking at george there just one problem what is that asked hermione boldly we re fred and george said the two in unison and they started laughing as they entered the burrow without a word will they ever learn to be mature hermione groaned under her breath they re just yanking your chain said harry frivolously i quite impressed that you didntblow up at them getting into a row with twins who run a joke shop i d save my breath for someone else said hermione grinning besides i know their intentions it just she drifted into silence as she stared at the article of harry potter secret heartache what harry asked warily it this article said hermione donttell me you she got to your head said harry that was years ago i know i know said hermione closing the magazine to look at harry it just that have you ever wondered about it harry looked at hermione what did she want him to wonder about how he had to suffer a lot of jeers from the slytherins due to the article and the other terrible things he encountered that year he recalled mrs weasley being cold towards hermione until he clarified his status with her wonder about what harry asked the sudden red spots on hermione cheeks made harry taken aback are you alright he asked her i i fine she said hesitantly i was just about to ask erm never mind it just stupid come on ask it said harry i bet it less embarrassing than the other thing i said awhile ago you mean sex come off it harry spat feeling a rushing sensation hit his chest and up his windpipe hermione was rolling on her spot as she laughed at him as he took an intake of breath to calm himself down before speaking just tell me what it is i doubt it will be the end of the world for you after regaining herself hermione sighed and looked at harry what i meant to ask of you was if you ever thought about erm she jerked her head on the magazine which fell to the ground when she laughed that what do you mean said harry not catching on what hermione said that hermione opened the magazine to the page of the article about them it took him awhile to figure it out what hermione was asking for he looked at her peculiarly and at the article what did she want from him you re asking me if i ever wondered about the article asked harry well i find it complete rubbish if you ask me i mean the very idea of you being with two boys at the same time it it would be very inappropriate i dontthink you are that kind of person hermione also the idea of you and me being a couple is maddening oh so you think the idea of an us isntpleasant hermione asked harry did a double take on her words erm yeah at least i think so said harry slowly he wasntquite sure how to assure her you do dontyou of course i do said hermione instantly can you imagine us being together think of the situations yeah said harry inadvertently just think of us walking around hogwarts with our fingers interlocking oooh she made a faux shudder that ll be quite an image and imagine you or me passing notes in the middle of class harry continued i ll be mortified said hermione humorously think of the classes and lectures i ll be ignoring while doing that let alone skipping classes with you so we can go have a picnic in the lake more like the quidditch pitch harry corrected it much nicer there yeah and clean too said hermione and continued but can you think about how long we will talk and bond if we were a couple ron will be furious and will feel left out i dontthink so said harry looking thoughtful we can always invite him on our dates wontthat be awkward she asked last time i checked dates are for two double date said harry casually he can have a date with either luna or lavender or erm parvati haha said hermione smiling ron needs love in his life too i guess anyway what place three broomsticks said harry madam puddifoot place reminds me of umbridge we canthave her in the relationship can we hermione giggled can you picture being in some of those romantic nonsense like how girlfriends and boyfriends give each other a part of something that if the two are together it makes them whole or something like they each wear bracelets with their name on it said harry remembering the fancy situations that aunt petunia would watch on tv yes said hermione think of you and me before i depart for ancient runes or arithmancy we give each other a bracelet and say think of me when you see this piece of rubbish my love said harry in mock drama then when i lose it you ll overreact and get angry at me for losing something meaningful then we ll break up and rita skeeter will have lots of juicy details to fill in her overly large head said hermione jokily after that we ll get together eventually thanks to ron being such a nice person for talking us to it yeah and then we ll snog snog snog snog all day long as a celebration of our reunion said hermione and shuddered she couldntbelieve she called that oh and we ll have nicknames said harry in mock eagerness ooooh said hermione lots of nicknames i think you ll call me erm hermy said harry chuckling that kind of couple ish right maybe hermione giggled and i ll call you snuggles harry raised an eyebrow snuggles your hair reminds me of my old stuffed bear when i was nine she smiled snuggles had untidy brown hair too bad i lost him when he got incinerated there was a short paused before harry said uncertainly i m sorry hermione chuckled it a stuffed bear harry hermione covered her mouth to stifle her giggles but thank you for your concern snuggles i rather be called harry hermy said harry in mock irate other than that we ll have field day of questions and bemusement in hogwarts i know said hermione think of how many of your admirers would want to hex me if they had the chance what for harry asked uncertainly you know said hermione shrugging i a mudblood well if they do then your boyfriend will be there to smack them one he said haha rita skeeter will have a field day on that one potter fights lies and ridicule as his girlfriend suffers the woes of racism it will be a prophet seller hermione burst out laughing harry looked at her as she held her stomach laughing heartily she stopped as tears started coming out of her eyes oh gosh she panted that was rich harry observed her cautiously hoping that she wouldntcollapse from laughing he found it strange that hermione would give his remark a large reaction she complete recollected herself and sighed leaving them in brief silence so you were thinking about it said hermione quietly what do you mean harry asked not catching on what hermione said this she turned to him the idea of us being together situations and stuff not really harry admitted i only made it up as i went along he picked up a pebble and threw it across the yard and into a bucket nice throw said hermione thanks harry smirked anyway there you go i really never thought about how we ll spend our time together but i have wondered about it how about you i did said hermione smiling at him after i read the article i was really annoyed by it and i asked myself about the idea of us being a couple then there i though about stuff and i just left it in memory she bit her lower lip i i was planning to ask you about it you know about your opinion on it but i thought it was best to not say so since you were busy with the triwizard tournament i never knew said harry looking at her what were your ideas hermione took a swig of her water bottle and made a deep sigh harry had the impression she was recalling what she thought about back then has it really been that long since the triwizard tournament well she rubbed her chin thoughtfully i thought about you taking arithmancy and ancient runes so you can be with me or something like that you know i can always walk with you to class right harry winced i really dontfancy reading runes or do wizarding math that fine she said speaking of which i never came across the idea of how we ll get together you know how we became a couple or some sort we really donthave to go around all places do we said harry already feeling weird about this it was fun talking to hermione about their faux relationship but there was a time and place to know when to set a limit they are best friends after all not really said hermione laughing i was jus throwing things around there i just happy that we re talking about this that all i see said harry his anxiousness ebbing away well i happy too hermione smiled sweetly at him the two then entered into a moment silence as the summer breeze raked their hairs harry yawned as he felt the taste of the moist from the summer leaves enter his mouth he closed his eyes as darkness surrounded his vision with a tinge of faint orange light from the suns light it was getting darker now he and hermione would enter the burrow to get ready for supper but you know said hermione resting her chin on her hand as she propped her elbow on her knees and gazed at the setting sun to be frank i i used to find it erm quite nice the idea of you for a boyfriend harry spun his head quickly at her he didntknow why the words that emanated from her lips were somehow soothing and as she said quite nice a growing sensation ballooned up inside him he knew it was somewhat strange to see her this way but he canthelp but feel delighted happy and satisfied that hermione liked the idea of him being her boyfriend i flattered said harry calmly smiling at her warmly that was nicest thing you ever said to me so far no problem she put her hands together and rested them on her lap as she swayed slightly blushing and smiling i really do oh hermione cut off as harry leaned forward and gave her a one armed hug it was something harry realized and that was how many times hermione would hug him whenever there was tension around him he would accept them in passing but at the moment this wonderful dusky moment he thought of hugging her himself he rested his hand on her shoulder as hermione leaned on his harry pressed his head on hers affectionately and pulled away i wontask said hermione beaming but you shouldnthave i should ve said harry besides i returning the favor after all of the hugs you ve given to me hermione blushed oh yeah she giggled i did it a lot of times didnti sure you did hermy said harry smiling the two gryffindors drank their bottles at the same time and took in the same quantity of water before putting them down again the sun was gone now harry noticed the sky turning blue with a shade of orange and yellow a faint star twinkled at him in the east i think we better get ready for dinner said hermione standing up harry turned to see hermione brushing her backside off of dirt for some reason harry wished they would skip dinner and just enjoy the night together he had fighting urge to grab hermione by the arm and pull her down on her seat harry hermione looked at him oh oh er yeah sure he shook out of his reverie and stood up quickly dinner time right after brushing the dirt out of his jeans he briskly followed hermione into the kitchen door as he noticed a falling star zoom by good morning snuggles hermione greeted harry as he entered the kitchen the next day harry tired eyes met the sight of hermione in her night gown beating eggs aroocooging harry muttered groggily sorry hermione asked taking a quick glance at him and back to the bowl of yellow beaten eggs are you cooking harry repeated registering the frying pan on the stove where mrs weasley she out said ron who was sitting at the table eating a plate of sausages she wasntable to cook enough for us er he ticked off his fingers four harry remembered that mr weasley usually departs for the ministry before sunrise and that fred and george left after dinner last night he was so used to all the weasleys being in the burrow that it felt almost downtrodden at the lack of weasleys his favorite family in the whole world have you eaten yet hermione harry asked seeing hermione pour a quarter of milk into the egg batter not yet said hermione pursing her lips i just cooking more eggs and sausages while mrs weasley is gone harry looked at her and a suddenly felt a rush of sympathy towards her he surveyed her every beat of the egg as the fork whipped in and out of sight amongst the thick yellow liquid which was now mixed in the white of the fresh milk let me cook said harry what let me cook harry nodded you need to take your breakfast hermione i can manage thank you hermione smiled at him come on said harry kindly i have more experience than you hermione chuckled before abruptly saying since when did you cook is it because of the dursleys harry caught hermione biting her lower lip before she finished her sentence there was an awkward silence between the two and harry knew why he could tell that hermione felt she said something offensive since it because of being ordered around by the dursleys that harry knows a lot of cooking frankly harry didntreally mind but he found it surprising that hermione felt insecure regarding his life with the dursleys i i sorry said hermione turning pink that was uncalled for i i didntmean hermy said harry holding her shoulder with a placate hand drop it he smiled at her i okay with it hermione turned to him and smiled weakly i just thought she bowed her head to face the egg batter i might remind you of your you know come off it said harry chuckling before harry could say anything ron stood up and looked outside of the kitchen door window frame oh bloody hell he groaned one of the gnomes is attacking the cabbages you need help hermione asked dontworry said ron i got it with a slick move of exit ron disappeared to the outdoors harry then turned to hermione and spoke to her as if there wasntany interruption look just let me do the cooking alright hermione nodded at him and sat at the table as harry started to cook eggs and sausages hermione did you bring your wand said harry overturning the sausages to cook the other side it in my bedside table why nothing said harry i was wondering if i could use it to help me cook he dodged at the popping oil i kind of read some of mrs weasley books and i was thinking of using one of them i mean we can do magic now right it was true they were of age now to do magic outside of school sorry harry said hermione checking her nightgown pockets to see if her wand was there i didntbring it would you like me to get yours if you dontmind said harry smirking at her hermione smiled at him and climbed up the stairs until she reached fred and george bedroom which harry used for the time being she opened the door to see the familiar boxes of weasley wizard wheezes products at the corner of the room harry trunk lay open as hedwig cage propped the lid open hedwig was asleep soundly at the top of the wardrobe above hermione looked around and saw the dresser facing the bed harry wand was as stiff as hedwig hermione picked it up and noticed something through the looking glass reflection on harry bedside table there was a piece of yellowish parchment which looked like it had a long essay in it curious got the better of hermione she turned on her heel while pocketing harry wand and walked to sit on harry unmade bed she took the parchment from its place and in spite of herself she read the first words of the long paragraph that stretched down to the bottom harry and hermione left the hospital wing right after they explained to ron what happened a few hours ago about how they saved sirius and buckbeak hermione time turner and how harry produced a real patronus they decided to go back to the gryffindor tower as they were all well and chocolate filled ron however had to remain behind due to his condition of a healing broken leg the two planned to visit him tomorrow when he ll be all well and done the corridors were quiet in the night as they walked harry looked out at the windows expecting to see the figure of buckbeak and sirius against the moon but they were probably flying over the mountains by now and beyond to a place where they will hide from the prying eyes of the ministry as another window passed harry looked below at a fraction of a second down at the grounds he felt a sense of foreboding about peter pettigrew wondering about at night how long until he reunites with his master and lupin wherever he is now he probably gnawing on a lone creature in the forbidden forest being all wild and dangerous he noticed one thing though he turned to see hermione she was the main reason how they managed to free sirius and buckbeak from grave fates he couldntbe any happier about her helpfulness tonight after all the things they did to her this year hermione caught his eye and raised her eyebrows at him harry replied with a smile which was returned by hermione the two traipsed on the corridor and up the marble staircase harry wondered where snape was he was probably up in his study swearing curses at a mental image of him sirius and lupin after what happened harry fought an urge to laugh for he enjoyed the quiet walk with hermione the thought of her returned to him again and he looked at her with the corner of his eye he knew that he shall soon thank hermione for everything that has happened tonight if it wasntfor her time tuner sirius wouldntbe free maybe when they arrive in the common room he will finally thank her flibbertigibbet said hermione idly harry gradually crept out of reverie as he followed hermione into the common room which was now empty a new idea sprang into his mind it was probably the best time to tell her well i off to bed said hermione stretching it been a strange night she smiled at him so goodnight hermione was on mid turn when harry spoke hermione she turned to him and said yeah you did great tonight he said smiling at her oh she looked down on him avoiding his eyes erm thanks no he said walking up to her so they were a meter apart thank you if it wasntfor your time turner i would never have a godfather now hermione smiled but still looked away from harry harry noticed she looked flustered erm you re welcome harry she said quietly you were great too she finally looked at him the patronus impressed me i thought it was amazing harry chuckled he couldntbut notice how stupid he looked scratching his head while he shifted balance on his stance yeah kind of surprised me too said harry frowning i i even thought it was my dad who did it he felt half ashamed admitting this and looked at hermione she was giving him the same look of sympathy she gave while they waited outside of the whomping willow you know she said smiling slowly i think he was there come off it said harry his embarrassment being at bay i was wrong alright i know i was just over i mean he was in you said hermione pointedly only a patronus that powerful can be produced through strong emotions you said you were able to do it because you realized that you can do it right well i think it was because you realize how much your father loves you which in turn made your patronus a stag this thing made harry feel clarified lupin said your father was named prongs i kind of connected a few things when i saw the patronus stag said hermione sheepishly i thought so too said harry recalling his face to face encounter with the white stag maybe i ll ask lupin about it after he gets back from being a werewolf he remembered how hermione revealed to them on lupin being a werewolf in retrospect he was quite impressed how she figured the entire thing out thanks to snape sending in the essays he frowned remembering how she found this all out when he and ron shunned her the whole time this year he somehow imagined the shock hermione must ve gotten when she finally connected the dots she probably had a hard time bottling it all up trying to find someone to talk to so she can feel free of being the only one knowing a jolt of guilt erupted inside him seeing hermione right in front of him smiling at him after all of the things she did for him then again there were lots of impressive things hermione has done this year that he seemed to ignore in the time being good call though said harry sounding casual on lupin being a werewolf haha she said tiredly it was nothing no i thought it was brilliant harry interjected her i would ve never seen it coming if it werentfor you in fact he held the couch which was adjacent to them and searched for words in his brain for the best statement to say to her to make her feel appreciated i i believe you deserve more than a thank you he felt a sensational grief in him you did things this year with much pressure that you still had the time to look out for me hermione didntanswer so harry continued the firebolt i i know now that i was immature for shunning you like that when you were trying to help he couldntbelieve he felt his heart pumping as his eyes felt hot i i made you feel that way he blinked again his eyes suddenly watery when hagrid said that he thought i would ve valued you more than a broomstick i couldnthelp but but he sniffed harry was very surprised he was welling up like this for hermione but feel i should ve been more appreciative you he pointed at her feeling quite a bit annoyed he was acting like this you were great you re a great friend i felt really bad when you ran away crying after my match with ravenclaw even how grateful i was that you were even there to watch me play he smiled at her i so sorry about what i did to you this year i i just want you to know that harry had the fighting urge to stop his arm from lifting to wipe his near watery eyes with his sleeve he looked at her and saw that hermione was in the verge of tears it was as if she wanted to hear this all year long there was an awkward silence between the two of them come here said harry croakily opening his arms come hermione walked slowly towards harry as he pulled her carefully by the sleeve of her sweatshirt he pulled her to him and wrapped her in a loving embrace harry felt hermione hot tears on his own shirt as he heard her soft sobbing he stroked her bushy brown hair as a new feeling of sensation erupted in his insides it was a wonderful feeling to hug her like this oh harry she moaned softly through sobs as she hugged him tightly thank you thank you its okay hermione its okay said harry smiling as a tear trickled out of his right eye rolled down on his cheek and landed on hermione hair he couldnthelp it he never felt any sorrier for her he hugged her tightly and lightly kissed her on the head it was nothing but this that made hermione look up at harry the two of them shared looks of apology grief of their own faults and realization harry looked into her big chocolate brown eyes and realized how pleasant she looked the two gazed in each other vision while interlocked in an embrace harry smiled down on her and slowly unknown of their own surroundings forgetting what they did tonight they kissed hermione lowered the yellow notepad feeling a numbing sensation it was one of those rare moments that she read something so touching and wonderful the fact that harry wrote this was something more shocking speaking of which i never came across the idea of how we ll get together you know how we became a couple or some sort hermione own words echoed in her mind she took a deep breath and reread the final part again they kissed she said weakly blushing she smiled broadly and bit her lower lip the last two words were powerful enough to make her feel this loving sensation hermione never knew harry would write this romantically but what made him want to write this she recalled their talk yesterday it was awkward talking about how they would do their relationship if ever rita skeeter articles were true but she thought it was okay to talk about it she really never felt a thing until now hermione slid a finger on the parchment with newfound longing it was a very nice piece of writing she thought to herself hermione then reread the whole thing again to make her giggle at it quietly when she read her favorite parts she couldnthelp it why would harry write this she didntwant to answer this herself but she just loved the moment of reading this sort of fiction of their own lives a fictional account of how they became a couple in their third year she found it both amusing and clever for him but what made her love it was how he described their embrace she couldnthelp but sigh longingly at the thought oh my merlin she said feeling butterflies in her stomach wow harry and at this moment hermione knew what has to be done she knew that this this piece of fiction idea must transition into fact ignoring her hunger hermione stood up and whistled as she worked about with hedwig groggily surveying her activity with one yellow eye hermione harry called opening the door of his empty bedroom it was already ten minutes in and she hasntgone back from getting his wand harry sighed to see it was still at the dresser where he left it last night he reckoned hermione went up to her room to get something and down back and grab his wand harry sighed and picked the wand up but only to see a piece of parchment under it he turned his head sideways to see a short paragraph written on it with hermione familiar neat handwriting looking around harry picked it up and read it he entered his bedroom calling out for her he said he felt that she was taking too long up there that he decided to take a look to see if she was there the moment he entered his room he observed his surroundings to see it was the same way it was as he left it last night he looked around his room to see it was indeed the same like last night and went back to the note he found a note on his dresser and read it his brow furrowed and as he reads it he will find out that the one he wrote for in his little story he made last night is right behind him before harry could finish the paragraph he reacted to what the parchment said and spun on his heel and saw someone standing by the door beaming at him with such infatuation while holding a yellowish parchment where he harry wrote a very meaningful but fictitious account of his third year in hogwarts it was hermione a n i apologize for the misunderstanding about the chapter update i had a little problem with the document upload oh lawd harry potter and the deathly hallows this saturday i implore that you all watch out for any possible leaked spoilers xxxii granger anatomy hermione wiped a towel in her wet ear as she descended the staircase towards the dark common room save for the pool of light that emitted from the fireplace her wet brown hair bouncing behind her at every step it was very comforting to feel the cool sensation traveling around her body after that nice shower hermione stepped on the landing of the common room to see that it was still like where she last left it her study things on a table in the corner of the common room and the fact that it was empty the bookworm dropped her towel on the backrest of the chair and flung herself on the other seat and pulled her defense against the dark arts book towards her hermione was already reading the first few words when she heard a low tired moan hermione stood up quickly and looked around the moan sounded horrific and she sort of felt her hair stand a bit on end hello she called to the dark corners of the common room nobody answered hermione slowly sank into her chair and then heard a familiar groan from the fireplace turning to look at the source her eyes met the backside of an armchair where she noticed an arm resting on the armrest the hand dangling on the edge lazily getting the best out of her curiosity hermione stood up and rounded around the armchair slowly and gasped harry hermione covered her mouth stunned it was harry alright but harry looked like he was in a right state his eyes were flickering wildly while obvious black patches were visible under them there was a twinge of green around his face and his nose was reddish his black hair was more than untidy and his mouth was slightly open as if he was wheezing in and out from it h harry can you hear me hermione bent over to him observing his face harry harry looked at her and opened his eyes slowly hermione couldnthelp but open her mouth in pity when she saw how red and tired they were h herbione wheezed harry weakly mispronouncing the m in hermione name the way he spoke this gave hermione the impression his nose was extremely stuffy oh my god hermione then held harry forehead which was hot as a water bottle in the winter harry you re burning are you alright harry opened his mouth slowly and spoke with great difficulty i ab fine h h herbione said harry weakly then in an instant he coughed loudly making hermione jump harry cough sounded like a cross between a bark of a dog and a hoarse croak oh my merlin harry you re sick hermione cried feeling his hot neck no herbione harry coughed another bark oh come off it harry hermione then pulled harry up to his seat and pushed him cautiously to the couch taking a seat beside him after doing so you re as hot as ever dontdeny it hermione watched anxiously as harry closed his eyes and made a sick gulp before nodding to her quickly m m maybe you re right harry croaked his voice sounded raspy i i just think by quidditch training gob be sick you re training too much harry said hermione kindly rubbing his back placidly look why dontyou go to your dormitory and rest there it too late to go to the hospital wing i i too tired he croaked tiredly i i just want to be here hermione winced at how weak he sounded she has never seen harry looked so helpless and needy if there was one thing harry needed right now it would be her care the hospital wing was probably closed and taking a sick harry who walked with jelly like legs wontbe an easy task in the dead of night i m c c cold said harry shivering of course you are said hermione taking her black robes off and put it around harry when one has a fever you skin gets sensitive to the temperature harry made a dry chuckle shivering under hermione robes i guess you read m medical b b b books then he croaked coughing seamlessly donttalk harry said hermione your sore throat will only get worse here she stood up and helped harry to lie down on the couch tell you what just lie down here and i ll get some pillows and blankets for you i ll even get you a hot water bottle to warm you up alright y y your really donthab to d do he coughed as he rested his head on the armrest that herbione i have to said hermione crouching so she was on eye level with him you need at least some care before we take you to madam pomfrey b but your studies remember when i said that there are more important things than books and cleverness she reminded him of what she said back in their first year during the time they went through the trapdoor friendship and bravery at the moment it all about friendship you need someone okay she warmly smiled at him i here and i not going anywhere harry stared at her with his tired green eyes for a fleeting moment hermione thought harry looked teary eyed which made hermione feel embarrassed a bit so said hermione standing up i am er going to go up to my dormitory to pick up a few pillows and blankets alright h how about you harry asked closing his eyes sleepily how are y y you going to sleep over there said hermione pointing to the armchair beside the couch that way i can be near you if you need anything harry turned to her and smiled at her weakly hermione returned the smile and stroke his jet black hair affectionately before going up to her dormitory and back down carrying pillows and blankets here you are harry said hermione handing him two of her pillows and a blanket just rest easy t thanks hermione said harry weakly before taking hermione robe off him removing his glasses off and lying down on the couch now that settled said hermione placing the hot water bottle under harry sheets taking harry glasses from him and standing erect while she observed harry do you need socks to warm up your feet harry shook his head i ll be right here if you need anything okay hermione smiled at him placing harry glasses on the coffee table hermione walked away from harry and summoned her book to her she took a seat on the armchair beside the couch and continued to study on where she left off as the minutes passed hermione would tear her eyes away from her defense against the dark arts book to glance at the sleeping harry who would cough or sneeze or sniff from time to time in between reading paragraphs hermione would drop her book and feel harry forehead and check if he tucked in it was quite amusing for her to do this she recalled how her mother took care of her when she was sick back in her pre hogwarts days hermione smiled at the memory of how her mother would stick a thermometer in her mouth to check her temperature speaking of which with a wave of her wand a thermometer conjured out of thin air as hermione caught it she slowly pulled one of the squat four legged seat cushions beside the couch so she could sit right beside harry sleeping state hermione shook the glass thermometer sharply and looked at it before slowly prodding harry awake harry harry hermione whispered as she prodded harry shoulder harry wake up harry groaned and turned on his side facing hermione and opened his eyes groggily even amongst the redness in them his brilliant green eyes never fail to show how engaging they were hermione didntspeak to harry but instead smiled at him and held up the thermometer in front of him fortunately harry knew what she meant and nodded opening his mouth slowly that a good boy she said soothingly placing the thermometer inside his mouth harry clamped the glass stick and idly rolled it along his lips hermione smiled and inadvertently stroked his jet black hair i just need your temperature harry hermione explained stroking his hair as she spoke that way we can have an idea on how warm you are harry nodded and his lips spread into a weak smile hermione giggled you know this isntthe first time i played nurse on someone i had to take care of my little cousin when she got flu my aunt and uncle werentthere at the moment so i had to take care of her for the evening until they got home with my parents she sighed luckily she got better the day after well harry croaked suddenly that m makes me f feel bositive sorry i i mean if y you re c cousin got better at least i know i will hermione felt harry hand grab hers as he squeezed it softly and tenderly looking from their closed hands to harry hermione smirked at him oh yeah a minute is over said hermione here she leaned forward to take the thermometer from harry mouth just as i expected said hermione in a satisfied tone oh my merlin you re closing in on high fever harry w we can always go to m madam pomfrey tomorrow croaked harry i i know she has the m medicine harry was cut off by painful throes of coughs hermione sympathetically leaned forward and patted his back as he coughed helplessly oh harry hermione moaned rubbing his back hold on i ll get a glass of water for you hermione stood up as harry coughed severely hermione took the pitcher of water which was usually stationed in the common room corner table for the house use and poured a glass of water for harry there there hermione muttered to harry as she sat on the seat cushion here harry honey drink it coughing up a storm harry nodded sat up to a sitting position and took a swig of the glass hermione watched anxiously as harry lowered the glass leaving it half empty or half full after drinking he breathed heavily and gulped a painful lump of air hermione unexpectedly moved to sit on the small spot of the couch behind harry so she could rub his back to relax him i i h hate being s sick harry groaned nobody does hermione assured him stopping her rubbing as she stood up are you alright harry nodded slowly t thanks h hermione said harry weakly for the water he lifted his glass feebly it no problem at all said hermione sweetly and without warning hermione leaned to harry and kissed him on his warm cheek an ice broke in hermione mind she didntknow why she felt it but she felt that she did something strange hermione leaned away from harry feeling embarrassed harry turned to her with his face sporting a tinge of redness s sorry said hermione quickly but fretfully i i didntk know where that came from n no said harry smiling at her i i r really d dontmind harry voice trailed away and they were met with an awkward silence erm hermione winced i will just get something there without another word hermione turned on her heel and made her way to the table she used awhile ago surveying a few of her school things a thought dawned to her it was never really a secret to her that she found an attraction towards harry well she found him somewhat of the idea boy she wanted in her life but the thought kept on going in and out throughout the time her fourth year was the moment where she noticed how handsome he was in fact there was a small glint in her soul during that time that she wished it was harry she was with in the yule ball fast forward to the present time hermione never felt any of a strong attraction towards him it has always hovered around her mind but it never fully developed due to her distractions with studying oh god hermione thought it kept bothering her that she put her studies before her love life not that it totally bothered her but if she kept on that habit for long she might never have her dream wedding ever but then again it never really hurt to take a few opportunities hermione recalled her birthday four months ago it was the most magical feeling ever when everyone prepared a surprise party in her honor initially her birthday started hurtful when harry and ron pretended her birthday did not exist which resulted to crying under suits of armor and feeling a surge of forlorn in the library it turned out that they were making her think it that way and ended up having one of the best birthdays ever the cherry on top was when harry gave her his birthday present oh how that present was worth all the trouble in the world four months ago sun rays passed through the windows of the defense against the dark arts classroom as they lit up the spot where a small gathering was once held among the area there was a table filled with school materials and an empty cake plate mind you the place isntalone for the hour since the presence of harry and hermione made it so er thanks again for what you did said hermione gingerly as harry swept the school materials into his school bag no problem said harry pointing his wand at the cake plate as it disappeared anything for my best friend he added and smirked at her hermione smiled and looked at the bracelet ginny gave her awhile ago you know for a second there said hermione her eyes on the bracelet i really thought you forgot about my birthday i was expecting you d be upset harry clarified frowning but i have to admit me and ron were surprised that you were expecting us to say something to you we wanted to make it a big surprise hermione giggled and i can guess that you told professor raptor to bully me in purpose in front of the class harry laughed while pushing the table at the corner of the classroom and said i told him that we were having a surprise for you he just improvised to catch you off guard it was convincing said hermione thoughtfully i really thought he was angry at me but look where it all ended up said harry turning to her smirking i know said hermione quietly turning from harry to ginny gift smiling oh yeah said harry dropping his bag i forgot my birthday present before hermione knew it she saw harry walk up to her and planted a kiss on her cheek and with all the power and energy in her hermione bit her lower lip looking stunned a rush of blood reached her cheeks as her mind raced in embarrassment and overwhelming emotion that was so unexpected like it harry asked raising his eyebrows amusingly at hermione i couldntfind anything else but that all i can give for all the things you ve done for me hermione nodded still biting her lower lip blushing furiously you re so cute when you look nervous said harry chuckling as he hoisted the bag up and left the defense against the dark arts classroom with a blushing hermione following at his wake hermione touched the spot harry kissed her she breathed deeply remembering the way his lips pressed on her soft skin as if it happened yesterday the way he just simply said that she was cute made her weak in the knees right there sadly though hermione failed to try to discuss to harry why he did it it just made him more appealing with his enigmatic stance but ever since the nineteen of september hermione never really thought of her crush on harry the only time she ever thought about it was during her rest hours or when she got out of a very deep conversation with harry by the end of it the crush ended up being an afterthought in her mind than something relevant though she would amuse herself by thinking about how her life would be if she ended up being paired with harry speaking of which harry fits of coughing woke hermione up from her reverie she turned to him and saw that he was recovering from his coughing he was shivering poor dear hermione looked at him with sympathy the only thing he needs now is three layers of sweaters sweaters an idea just popped up in hermione head how could she be so stupid she ran up the girl dormitory without telling harry and came back with a brilliant green sweater with patterns of pale green diamonds across the cloth hermione walked around the couch and stood in front of harry holding it up for him to see w what is it harry croaked squinting at the sweater hermione handed his glasses from the coffee table and held the sweater up again as harry put his glasses on a sweater he croaked weakly for you said hermione remember when i forgot to give you a christmas present last month well this was supposed to be the present but giving it to you slipped my mind for some reason i knitted it hermione smiled eagerly at him as harry sitting up looked at the sweater with his puffy eyes and turned to her it beautiful he said with difficulty a nice sensation filled her lungs at the compliment of course i made it for you she said joyfully it has love in every knit if harry wasntsick he could ve laughed at this but instead he made a very hoarse chuckle y you cantb be any wittier can you he croaked looking at her with amusement hermione frowned at him i really meant that she said with slight hurt in her voice i i sorry said harry sheepishly i d didntmean before harry could finish his sentence he started coughing rigorously again putting the sweater on her forearm hermione walked to harry as she sat on the couch patting his back consolingly dammit harry complained taking a deep breath i really really h hate this harry donttalk said hermione the more you talk the more it hurts e easy for y you to say come off it harry said hermione sternly look what you need right now is rest and relaxation i reckon you d get better by tomorrow if you continue resting harry just look you re shivering here she held up the green sweater this will warm you up ignoring harry retort hermione pulled the sweater over harry head fortunately the hole where the head goes in fitted harry head perfectly and hermione didnthave any trouble helping harry with the sleeves perfect fit said hermione happily i i cantpull the sweater down harry pointed out trying to reach the tightly rolled up torso part of the sweater at his back i ll help hermione unrolled the hem of harry sweater and pulled it down his torso until his sweater fully clothed over his pajama top it was at this moment that after properly fixing harry sweater around the torso hermione hand stopped on harry abdomen she didntknow why but for all the reasons in the world she slightly squeezed it gently and couldnthelp but find harry abdomen very firm wow he really worked out on the quidditch pitch h hermione harry croaked w what are you doing a strong mental mallet hit hermione in the head what was she doing oh hermione gasped and backed away from harry standing up as she did so i i hermione blushed furiously she couldntbelieve that she felt harry abs without his consent the way harry green eyes bore into her brown ones with puzzlement made hermione all the more embarrassed than ever what was he thinking will he shrug off this awkward situation will he think hermione is some weird lunatic who is trying to take advantage of him due to his sick and helpless state hermione took a sharp intake of breath and stared at harry with all her dignity d did harry croaked hermione felt anxious at how annoyed he sounded where you f feeling m my abdomen hermione he asked slowly with a twinge of tiredness in his voice i i sorry hermione whispered i didntmean to h hermione said harry trying to talk loudly but only brought out a rasp you donthave to be sorry argh harry gasped as he squeezed the bridge of his nose a are you alight hermione asked anxiously taking a step forward headache said harry through gritted teeth oh god said hermione seeing harry face contorted with pain here she waved her wand conjuring a ceramic bowl out of thin air aguamenti she chanted spouting water from her wand to the bowl after filling it halfway from the brim hermione went for her bag and pulled out her handkerchief dabbing the cloth with the water in the bowl hermione moved towards harry and ushered him to lie down on the couch lie down harry said hermione seeing harry obey her while he rubbed his forehead with his palms this will soothe the ache slowly and placatory hermione placed the wet rolled up handkerchief on harry forehead which was met by a satisfied moan from harry feeling relieved that the sudden headache forced them out of an awkward conversation hermione continued dabbing harry forehead slowly shhh hermione said slowly while harry groaned in pain as his headache throbbed a bit painfully dontworry i here hermione then continued doing this for the next fifteen minutes while seated on the seat cushion she couldntdeny how tiring this was but for what it worth being there to tell harry to calm down because she was there with him made all the difference feeling better hermione asked kindly squeezing the water into the bowl harry nodded sickly there there said hermione slowly placing the handkerchief on harry forehead i ll just put it there alright she stood up and bent over at harry i ll just get you a glass of water t thank you said harry groggily hermione returned to harry side with a glass of water harry slowly took a swig of it after sitting up the wet handkerchief on his forehead still he gave a relaxed sigh and gave the glass to hermione feel better my head still hurts harry groaned massaging his forehead i know said hermione earnestly standing up lie down harry harry obeyed while rubbing his head as hermione moved to the side of the couch and leaned against the armchair as harry lain his head on the fluffy scarlet pillow harry was met with a very tender yet soothing massage from hermione hermione smirks as she sees harry closing his eyes enjoying the massage her hands traveled from the temples of harry to the center of his brows his forehead and the top of his head which made harry moan in contentment hermione smiled warmly at him can he be any more adorable she cantdeny how his helpless state made him like a sad puppy ugh hermione that good harry moaned as hermione massaged the back part of his head it somehow didntoccur to her that as she massaged harry she was leaning her head close to his until her face was right above his upside down and only a few inches away harry then opened his eyes and slightly jerked his head at the sight of hermione w what are you doing t there harry asked weakly hermione didntanswer but simply smiled at him how the headache she asked it kind of gone said harry anxiously erm thanks i told you i can take care of you said hermione beaming there was a brief silence hermione and harry just looked at each other beaming with so much affection for each other i so glad y you re h here h hermione harry whispered coughing before he finally added i d pick you over madam pomfrey anyway a touching sensation overwhelmed hermione when harry said these words hermione smiled warmly at him and slowly leaned to him kissing him on the forehead t that w was less awkward than last harry chuckled harry was right was it because what harry said it made hermione felt less awkward than last awhile ago she kissed harry on the cheek resulting to a very awkward situation but right now as they looked into each others eyes the kiss on the forehead was nothing but lovely hermione cantdeny it as she was there taking care of harry she felt a surge of attraction towards him the same attraction she been keeping at bay for the past four months since her birthday all she wanted was to be with him and here she was having harry under her doting care without a madam pomfrey or a ron or a teacher to help her i sleepy harry croaked then go to sleep harry said hermione consolingly lying her cheek on top of harry forehead so she was leaning on harry head gently she wrapped her arms around his warm head as she sighed i hope you ll be alright okay of course i i will be harry whispered you re here with me and after a quarter of an hour harry fell asleep as hermione released her embrace she stroked his black hair lovingly and kissed him again only this time on the temple before standing up sinking into the near armchair and taking her choice to slumber for the cold night hermione woke up with a start huh she said groggily scratching her eyes as the image of the dark common room materialized before her eyes it suddenly occurred to her that the reason she woke up so abruptly was that harry made one loud cough hermione sighed at him and checked her watch it was only half past five not feeling sleepy due to the intense cold around the dark common room hermione left her couch and checked on harry who was still as hot as ever she carefully examined him and noticed he was breathing through his nose which made her realize that harry must ve lost the stuffiness in his nose last night while resting her chin on her knuckles a thought came to hermione as she saw the rising and falling chest of harry pretty soon enough she will be escorting harry to the hospital wing where madam pomfrey will be glad enough to heal him in no time it a good thing yes but why was it bothering her so she recalled last night on the way she took harry under her nursing it was very pleasant and it really brought her closer to harry not only that she had a guilty pleasure in seeing harry this helpless sick boy who needs treatment hermione winced at why she ever thought that but brushed it off when harry stirred w what time is it he offhandedly asked at the dark common room as if he initially knew someone was there ten minutes until six said hermione oh harry croaked and drifted to sleep again hermione smiled and stroked his bangs revealing his legendary scar she slid a finger on the lighting bolt shaped scar as she felt the thin rough line of the scar slide beneath her fingertips a frown spread across her face remembering the scar brought him to this status of being famous it never really bothered her that the famous harry potter is her best friend but what bothered her by the slightest was how much she had to cope with his fame without a thank you from him not that she thought it was mandatory she recalled all the things they ve done that was usually the products of his fame the fiasco at the department of mysteries the adventures into the sorcerer stone chambers and the d a d a a shrill of excitement reached across hermione face when she finally found a way to help her inner battle about harry but wontit feel like it more of an obsession she really likes him and didntlike the idea that she wontbe the one to care for him anymore if she were to go with the idea that has popped in her mind how can she pull it off without harry noticing he too sick to think properly just leading him will be easy hermione stopped stroking harry bangs and put her hands on her lap what in merlin name is she thinking this is a sick harry she thinking on hoodwinking what he needs is proper care from a profession healer not some underage witch who thinks she can do better but all she wanted was to let harry know that she will take care of him oh the bleeding hearts of the world all she wanted was for harry to remember that it was she who took care of him and brought him back to good health hermione shook her head vigorously and buried her face in her hands and started thinking it no lie i like harry and i really want to be the one to get him better at least that will make him think different of me other than a friend if ever hermione then thought it over her plan was fool proof after all what was there to go wrong she will have everything she needs to help harry go back to full health so what was the big holdback on pushing on with it i not a healer so what she not a fighter but she managed to survive the department of mysteries years ago and she didntreally have any formal training apart from the d a d a the thought of the d a went back to her making her feel a rush of decision making pressure if she has to do it she must do it now oh god hermione groaned to herself it now or never hermione prodded harry awake who woke up with a heavy bark like cough w whazzgoinon he croaked with a dry sort of voice harry it me hermione said hermione ginning at him i going to take you to madam pomfrey now remember in an instant harry nodded obediently and swung his legs off the couch and rubbed his eyes groggily hermione praised him for being obedient and ushered him kindly to put on his trainers which he did sleepily a minute later he was wearing his pajama bottoms still a sweatshirt and a very sick posture when he stood up gingerly just sit on the armchair over there said hermione turning to the couch where harry slept and waved her wand making all of the pillows blankets and the water bottle fly to her dormitory formally another flick of the wand and the small crater which harry made on the couch flumped back to place as if no one sat on it ready hermione turned to harry who nodded hermione helped harry up to his seat and helped him clamber out of the portrait hole the corridors at this hour were half dark but a tinge of purple orange and blue glowed across the horizon as the cold breeze whipped around them silently quietly hermione held harry by the arm as he walked with her in a staggered manner moaning quietly coughing occasionally the sound of the morning crickets chirped from the outside window that they passed as the smell of the morning moist met their nostrils it was a few moments until hermione led harry away from the marble staircase and down another corridor are you alright harry hermione asked anxiously harry nodded and obeyed hermione sense of direction they trudge forward a bit until harry lifted his head and surveyed a familiar tapestry of a wizard teaching tutu wearing trolls to dance the ballet w where are w we h hermione harry asked groggily t this is not the hospital wing is it o ofcourse it is dear said hermione apprehensively moving pass the tapestry we we are just taking a shortcut the marauder map says that there a passage here hermione croaked harry i know the map like the back of my hand i d dontthink there one luckily for hermione harry coughed loudly as hermione took this chance to pass back down the corridor of the tapestry of the dancing trolls i need a place where i can take care of harry i need a place where i can watch over him while he is sick hermione w where are you taking me harry asked sleepily now with worry in his voice as they traipsed the hallway the third time hermione didntanswer him but was delighted when she saw a door melting into view on the blank wall opposite of the tapestry of barnabas the barmy teaching the trolls to dance the ballet smirking hermione helped a coughing harry into the door where a new room met her eyes it was a small comfortable velvet room decorated with chestnut colored furniture a single bed was located at the center of the room facing the door and the floor was carpet tilled with deep crimson to the side of the room was a tall and large cabinet that played host to a lot of prescriptions bottles beside the bed was a small cabinet filled with medical equipment and to the side of that was drawer that probably contained pillows and blankets to the right of the room was a doorway that led to the bathrooms perfect hermione muttered turning to harry now let get you to the bed okay it wontbe hard luckily harry was too sick and weak to register where he entered taking this as her advantage hermione helped harry climb onto the bed and tucked him in she looked at him anxiously as he lay down on the bed dropping his head on the fluffy pillow hermione instantly took the reserve blankets on the foot of the bed and set the sheet on top of harry are w we in the h hospital wing harry asked weakly squinting sickly at the area hermione bit her lip and winced erm this is the hospital wing harry said hermione bending over to him we are in a erm private ward that i requested from madam pomfrey oh harry croaked and turned his head sleepily at the cabinet filled with prescription bottles m my head hurts hermione feeling a bit alarmed hermione nodded to harry and thought the first thing that came up in her mind shove an aspirin down his throat she glanced at the cabinet and approached it thankfully they were aligned in alphabetical order so all she needed to do was to find the pill this was not the case where is it hermione asked herself tiptoeing up to see that she has passed all the a letter prescription pills how can it not be here hermione frowned as she looked took a double take on all the corners of the cabinet surely no one had used the room of requirement this way we re out harry said hermione turning to him b but dontworry she added quickly when she saw a glint of pain in his eyes i ll think of something oh god hermione what are you going to do what are you going to do you should ve sent harry to the hospital wing where he rightfully belongs but no you had to give in to your personal feelings hermione shook her head and elaborated on the current situation now isntthe time to complain about harry current location what mattered was getting harry headache out of the loop rubbing her chin hermione thought hard on where to get aspirins obviously this was muggle medicine so that rules out the hospital wing and asking for a headache remover potion from madam pomfrey will make her look suspicious in fact she cantrecall if it was allowed to take out medication potions out of the school ward think hermione think who is the one person who would ever use muggle medicine in this school of wizards knock knock knock hermione rapped on the door courteously checking her watch she realized it was probably too early to wake him up at this time blocking out the thought of what will he do if he finds out that she woke him up from his sleep hermione knocked on the door again and was greeted by the opening of the door oh hermione gasped lowering her hand er good morning professor raptor miss granger professor raptor a muggle born wizard with a reptilian demeanor huffed groggily with a slight tone of indignant in his voice do you have any idea what time it is this wasntthe first time professor raptor sounded like this despite his usual cheery personality he tends to go borderline murderous whenever he is disturbed hermione winced and took a slight step backward from the office door s sorry professor hermione squeaked i i just n need y your help that all professor raptor sighed and bowed his head tiredly hermione then registered the red bathrobe he was wearing and the cane that he was holding himself up on hermione he said looking up at her with a sleepy blink what do you need feeling relieved at his generosity hermione asked him if he had any aspirins what gives you that idea he asked gesturing hermione to get inside the warm office er i recall seeing a prescription bottle on the teacher desk when we did double defense against the dark arts last week hermione said quietly oh really said professor raptor raising his eyebrows your sharp eyes amaze me granger he looked up thoughtfully as he limped across the office on his cane and went to a nearby cabinet are you alright professor hermione asked anxiously looking at his cane i ve been hearing about your er pain it nothing said professor raptor rummaging around the top of the cabinet surface hermione noticed he reached in for his pocket and took out a prescription bottle of white tablets thinking that this was the aspirin hermione took a step forward to ask but stopped when she heard the door open behind her hermione turned on her heel and widened her eyes at the sight of her potions teacher professor snape who was holding a potion flask filled with green liquid severus greeted professor raptor with an air of being steely dimitri replied snape softly hermione took a double take at what snape called to professor raptor and realized that this must be his real name professor raptor was always known as rapticon sr what brings you here said rapticon sr shaking a tablet from the prescription bottle hermione saw earlier onto his hands professor dumbledore has explained to me about the condition on your foot he nodded to rapticon sr bandaged foot he implored me that i create a potion for you to ease the pain really now rapticon sr grinned impressively hermione noted how he popped in the tablet into his mouth quite generous of the hogwarts staff to give me a little footing clearly said snape placing the potion on the desk that way you can see the superiority of wizarding potions in contrast to that he pointed to the prescription bottle that rapticon sr held my boat not yours said rapticon sr serenely cracking his neck besides vicodin works wonders hermione eyes widened at rapticon sr who now shoved another pill into his mouth i see said snape and turned to hermione and might i ask why miss granger is here at the wee hours of the morning in your office i might add she needs aspirin rapticon sr interjected as he limped back to the cabinet and pulled out an orange bottle of aspirins i think the potion essays are getting to her head severus he handed the bottle to hermione and winked at her humorously seriously they re getting longer he turned to snape i dontthe point in making them shorter dimitri said snape coolly anyway there a cauldron full of this potion if you need any i implore that you at least try the potion because it can take away the yellow ooze on your foot that is now perturbing the very sight of the naked eye hermione looked at rapticon sr bandage and saw that there was a tinge of yellow on it wincing hermione turned to him c can i go now sir hermione asked politely yes you may hermione said rapticon sr nodding to her courteously see you at class later thank you sir hermione smiled weakly thank you also for the aspirins anytime rapticon sr leaned on his cane as he waved a lazy hand at her hermione nodded to snape awkwardly and slowly walked out of the office seeing rapticon sr shove another vicodin pill into his mouth before going along the corridor it wasntover for that awkward meeting to end on hermione terms when she heard snape speaking why do you not deplore yourself for chronically taking in those muggle pills dimitri snape voice said lazily then rapticon sr voice spoke with sarcasm and sly because they are yummy hermione stopped dead on her tracks and stared back at the office door astounded then slowly she walked away with the aspirins in her hand and without knowing broke into a run here you go said hermione happily giving harry a pill of aspirin ten minutes later harry nodded groggily as he slipped in the pill in his mouth and began to drink from a glass of water hermione gave feeling better harry hermione asked stroking his black hair as he drank harry nodded slowly and put down his glass on the bedside table now go and lie down alright like an obedient puppy harry nodded and fell on his pillow and closed his eyes hermione leaned forward and touched his forehead it was less hot than last night you re not as hot as last night harry said hermione delightfully hopefully you ll be alright sooner harry moaned in response but didntsay anything hermione smiled at him and feeling half ashamed at how she took advantage of this she leaned and kissed harry on the forehead w where madam pomfrey harry croaked turning to hermione with his eyes closed s she somewhere t there said hermione nervously she almost forgot that harry thought they were in a private ward in the hospital wing she quite busy oh said harry and winced awkwardly as he stretched his arms and fell asleep again hermione sighed and sank to a nearby armchair watching harry sleep soundly dontbe too guilty he doing great not that it troubled her but she canthelp but feel that this whole situation she going through will come back to her and bite her in the ass not only was she taking advantage of harry weakness she was also lying to him and pushing him away from an instant healing from madam pomfrey her emotions towards harry were fighting inside her as she felt a lump in her throat gulping it in hermione groaned and started staring into space thinking what she had to do next until her eyes fell on her watch which told her that she had an hour to prepare before her first class starts ancient runes another problem came up to her mind at the thought of this she cantleave harry here all alone in this room what if he wakes up in fits of coughing harry needs me no harry needs proper medication hermione cursed under breath and paced around the room thinking of what she has to do about this maybe she can skip classes and say she got sick oh merlin hermione thought the irony in that excuse was astounding stopping on her tracks hermione turned around to see if there anything she can use for her current dilemma it quite strange that the room of requirement wonteven give her that at the moment but then again this was a medical ward not a planning room her mind swirled around for an idea until it finally hit her when she remembered how the room of requirement was discovered dobby it felt a bit awkward to think about it but dobby was a free house elf would he listen to her request of course this relates to harry potter and dobby would be glad to help she remembered too well on how devoted dobby was to harry but if i ask dobby a request wonti be going against my s p e w movement no this is not the time to think about elfish rights feeling that it was obvious to do this hermione turned on an empty spot on the floor and spoke dobby crack hermione nearly jumped when the familiar shape of dobby the house elf materialized in view as he eagerly looked around the room his green tennis ball sized eyes finally fell to hermione making his face contort with question i hear someone call dobby ma am squeaked the house elf that was me dobby said hermione wincing bending over to him i i erm kind of need you at the moment but i er have a feeling it might be awkward asking you ah no need to fret friend of harry potter said dobby puffing his chest out dobby knows the greatness and goodness of harry potter so much that his companions reflect his very personality feeling slightly affronted by this hermione tilted her head at dobby funny really said hermione crouching before dobby my request is related to helping harry helping harry potter ma am dobby eyes widened with eagerness dobby will be glad dobby is earnest to help harry potter friend you can call me hermione dobby hermione implored kindly but she was sure that dobby didnthear her but what task has harry potter friend entrusts to dobby ma am asked dobby eagerly i want you to take care of harry she pointed to the bed where harry slept which dobby only realized dontworry about him dobby he alright harry potter is sick squealed dobby shhh hermione pressed a finger to her lips quickly look all i want you to do is to take care of harry while i away you know like when he wakes up you come to him and ask if he needs anything i know what you are talking about ma am dobby nodded obediently dobby has his fair share of treating his sick masters in the past and more recently winky how is she she is doing great and is now helping around the kitchen said dobby that great said hermione happily dobby i just want you to take care of harry while i away dontdo anything rash or premature if harry needs water then the pitcher is over there oh if he says that his head hurts tell him to rest easy and get lots of sleep if harry asks what are you doing here tell him that you heard of his sickness and decided to volunteer to help him recover understand dobby nodded and stood straight to show his determination hermione smirked at this and one more thing hermione continued if he hungry just give him some vegetable soup always hits the spot ma am said dobby gladly dobby will make sure harry potter friend request will be fulfilled thank you dobby said hermione oh wait i almost forgot hermione took out the aspirin bottle and emptied the contents on a piece of napkin on harry bedside table this is harry medicine pills hermione explained i reckon harry will have a lot easier time getting them off a napkin than putting his fingers inside this small container she held up the empty prescription bottle and pocketed it make sure that he doesnttake too much alright just think of this as saving harry life got it ah harry potter is glad that he has friends like you squeaked the house elf he was right when he said that you are one of a kind a spark of interest hit hermione what she asked the house elf h he said i am one of a kind mmmhmmm nodded the house elf harry potter visited the kitchens last week to get food for his other friend ronald weasley i praised him for his goodness and he said that he is doing his friend a favor oh the modesty of the great harry potter while on the subject of friends he then told about you and your kindness that he adores so much hermione blushed he did she asked slowly yes yes he states that you are the only girl in his life worth caring for without question he says that never in his life that he met someone so fondly amusing a grin spread across hermione face as she felt a flattering sensation in her gut so harry has been saying things about her to other people what a nice thought the cough of harry brought her back to earth she checked her wristwatch to see it was already thirty minutes until ancient runes she still has to fix her things and get ready er dobby i have to go to my class now she explained looking down at the house elf can i leave things up to you here dobby saluted and nodded to her that a good house elf said hermione cheerfully oh before i leave if harry asks where he is tell him that he is in the hospital wing and that madam pomfrey is too busy to tend to him remember that it is you who is taking care of him wontthat be lying miss dobby asked anxiously n no said hermione forgetting that dobby loyalty to harry means that he wontlie to him it more like protecting him from doing rash things you see i dontwant him in a panicked state so we just need to calm him down as much as possible until he feels better luckily dobby bought hermione explanation and nodded to her in acknowledgement of his duty i ll be back at lunch and again in the afternoon said hermione walking towards the door what will i say miss if harry potter asks of your whereabouts hermione turned to dobby tell him that i went to my classes and that i wish him good health and that i will be back shortly hermione bade dobby goodbye and clambered out of the room of requirement hermione exited out of ancient runes class feeling both happy about her quiz results and anxious due to her wonder about harry right now checking her schedule to get her mind off harry she sees that her next subject is double defense against the dark arts she winced remember earlier how she found out her professor has been chronically taking in pain killers thanks to his injured foot but what bad could happen professor raptor is always a rational man a few minutes later she was greeted by the sight of her classmates entering the defense against the dark arts classroom hermione hurried after them and finally entered greeting professor raptor as she entered to her surprise he shook another pill of vicodin and popped it into his mouth oh that hits the spot he muttered hermione finally found a seat beside ron her other best friend who greeted her hermione i was wondering when i ll be seeing you today he said where harry by the way i haventseen him since this morning and during our free period an uncomfortable lump of air climbed up hermione throat i i really dontknow said hermione quickly catching dean and seamus greeting her and ron as they sat down in front of them i hope he comes said ron he might miss class quiet said rapticon sr aiming his wand at the door closing it the class gave their attention to him as rapticon sr scratched his head irritably and leaned on his cane he stuck a tongue out and surveyed the class with great interest i find this class interest interesting he said simply to the students and pursed his lips hermione exchanged unsure looks with ron what with him ron muttered remember that disease he warned us about during orientation hermione said quietly yeah bumblefoot was it yes erm well he developing that disease at the moment remember that it can render him with eccentricity hello wizarding people said rapticon sr happily stepping forward with his cane in one hand and their loved ones that is if you have a loved one here just remember the rule on public display of affection anyway in the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later we re are going to have a defense against the dark arts debate you can call it debate for short he then gestured to lavender brown and continued his speech now this ray of sunshine is today debate mistress you see she runs the whole debate so unfortunately she much too busy to deal with the whips and the deputy prime ministers why a debate you ask he raised his arms at the class because i am bored a certified soldier in the war and a graduate in cambridge university and i am also the only professor in this school who is forced to be here against his will hermione and ron looked at each other with widened eyes they never knew that bumblefoot would make their professor that much of a nutter he mad whispered ron but not to worry rapticon sr continued because for most of you this job could be done by a thestral with a bottle of firewhisky speaking of which if you re particularly annoying you may see me reach for this he pulled out a yellow prescription bottle which hermione instantly recognized this is vicodin it mine you canthave any hermione face palmed and peeked through her fingers at professor raptor who spoke and no i do not have a pain management problem i have a pain problem he then paused and said in a dramatic tone but who knows maybe i wrong then his eyes widened with a glint of malice in them maybe i too stoned to tell a sharp intake of breath could be heard from behind hermione instantly identified it as neville s so who wants a debate he asked happily nobody raised their hands but stood their stunned at their professor speech no rapticon sr looked around looking put out eh debates tend to get out of hand anyway they can be fun if you handle it right said lavender poignantly not really i have to admit said rapticon sr i i think so though said lavender quietly all the more reason this exchange is pointless said rapticon sr coolly and turned on his heel as he requested the class to take out their books hermione and ron smirked at each other at this and took out their books as requested hermione reached for her bag for a quill but remembered that she left it in her robe pockets taking out the empty prescription bottle of aspirin out hermione reached in her robe pockets and got her quill she placed it on the surface of the table neatly only to realize that ron was staring at the empty prescription bottle with interest what is this ron asked remembering harry hermione made an attempt grab it but failed when ron held the bottle to his eye in pointblank range what is this hermione ron repeated i it nothing ron now give me that what the commotion here rapticon sr traipsed towards them with his cane n nothing said ron quickly lowering the bottle on the surface isntthat the prescription of aspirins i gave you miss granger rapticon sr asked pointedly at the bottle ron lowered y yes said hermione nervously er can i have the bottle back ron it was too late though rapticon sr picked it up and examined it hey this was half full or half empty when i gave it to you he said lowering the bottle what happened to the rest hermione well i kind of emptied it hermione stuttered emptied it said dean turning to her you mean you took in all of them no it not like that dean oh my merlin gasped rapticon sr enigmatically putting a hand over his mouth are you being a chronic aspirin dudette everyone turned to hermione while hermione flushed is that why you asked me for the meds rapticon sr continued y you should talk said hermione quickly her voice higher than usual you and your vicodin there only one difference hermione said rapticon sr lazily as he popped in a pill into his mouth but whatever that difference was hermione will never know because the moment rapticon sr finished his say he jumped and yelped in pain as he clutched his infected foot yelling out lamentations about how he overturned a kayak as the class watched in horror it not true ron hermione pleaded as they exited the defense against the dark arts classroom an hour later i implore you that i not even accusing you hermione said ron it just that i heard from my dad about how muggles can get addicted to those things but i not addicted to it hermione cried turning on her heel at ron professor raptor is just saying things i mean he the one popping pain killers into his mouth so explain to me why are you carrying that ron asked hermione touched her cheek thoughtfully was it worth telling the truth this is ron she talking about hermione can trust ron right erm said hermione alright i ll tell ron leaned forward to her to listen carefully the prescription bottle is not for me it for harry said hermione quickly w what for harry ron looked at her confusingly i i dontunderstand the aspirins are for harry ron said hermione anxiously you see he really sick at the moment yes that why he wasntin class she added looking at ron eyes widening and i am taking care of him there no time to explain ron i have to go back to harry in the room of requirement wait you left harry there ron asked incredulously of course he is not alone ron said hermione dobby is watching over him oh and you think he more trustworthy to learn your little florence nightingale moment with harry before me eh said ron coolly not now ron hermione snapped look i know i should ve brought him to the hospital wing but i didn t now is not the time to explain further i really need to go see harry fine but i coming with hermione and ron entered the room of requirement ten minutes later to see dobby sitting on a stool and he seems to be reading a bedtime storybook to a sleeping harry dobby said hermione dobby jumped from his seat and was relieved to see hermione harry potter is doing great miss he squeaked gesturing to harry sleeping state he didntask any questions but he was a good boy harry potter just asked for the time and continued sleeping and then you came miss that excellent dobby said hermione patting the house elf on the head i can take it from here maybe you should go back to the kitchens oh of course i will said dobby i just honored that i once again aided harry potter and his friend and with a bow to hermione and ron dobby disappeared with a crack blimey said ron looking at harry sick state he seems to be in a right state not really said hermione quietly i ve been taking care of him since last night when i found him looking all sick in the common room all alone she sighed no wonder he wasntin the dormitory last night ron muttered yeah i reckoned he needs my care said hermione slowly spreading her face into a smile and i did but why not bring him to madam pomfrey now hermione said ron i bet she can get harry out of this state in no time shhh ron hermione cried lowering her voice harry doesntknow that he isntin the hospital wing ron jaw dropped what you mean you lied to harry hermione bit her lip kind of and added quickly look i just trying to help him alright but hermione think said ron his voice growing to normal volume madam pomfrey can heal almost any disease harry sickness is probably a piece of cake for her it not that ron said hermione blushing furiously it just that i want to take care of harry you re not even pursuing to be a healer hermione said ron i know that she said i telling you that i just want to take care of harry for a change for a change ron raised hi eyebrows i dontunderstand hermione i i just want harry to remember that it was i who got him well i know that but why ron asked pleadingly what are you fancying him or something he asked jokingly and chuckled hermione blushed furiously and bit her lip ron chuckling drifted into silence as he gaped at her are you he asked okay ron said hermione cautiously i i just want to take care of harry alright alright said ron skeptically but that wontbode well with harry when he gets back to normal just listen ron said hermione ignoring the fact that she was almost loud all i want to do was to take care of harry that all but then i realized how much i wanted to be with him so that why i sent him here into this place i wanted to be the one to give him what he needs i want to be the one who makes him feel safe i care about him so much ron that it maddening look all i want is for harry to know that i care about him a lot ron gazed at her perplexedly hermione bit her lip and blushed furiously she couldntbelieve she said that before hermione or ron could say anything a weak and feeble voice spoke t that w was the sweetest thing i e ver heard hermione harry moaned quietly oh god harry hermione gasped flinging herself to his side are you alright harry she asked holding his hand harry slowly opened his eyes and turned to hermione the aspirin worked for some reason he croaked harry voice wasntthat croaky anymore but rather back to his normal voice i was kind of awake though i heard you and ron bickering so i thought i d check what going on i heard some parts of it but understood why you lied to me hermione blushed and giggled nervously harry i so sorry i didnttell you about hey dontbe he said at least i know you d go that far to make sure i am healed right hermione smiled weakly but i should ve known better hermione cried what if i couldnthelp you heal in time you might ve gotten pneumonia or something oh harry i so sorry h hermione said harry calmly dontworry about it look i feel a bit better than hours ago sure my eyes are still maddening hot and that i still feel warm but thanks to you i feel better thanks to you so no hard feelings alright said harry hermione lip trembled but slowly nodded her mind raced a bit what will harry think of her now all she wanted was for harry to be impressed of her care for him she wanted harry to notice how much she cares a lot for him how much she loves him will that time ever come she really wanted to pay harry back for what he did for her on her birthday why the long face hermione harry asked with concern n nothing she said disappointedly i i have to admit i tried and wanted to be the one to nurse you back to good health she hung her head anxiously i guess that wonthappen hermione said harry quietly dontbe thick you were a great help to me i really enjoyed last night when it was you who took care of me i felt safe and secure i could really tell how much you cared for me hermione giggled well i just want to see you back to good health again i know i will be said harry rubbing his head you gave madam pomfrey a head start he smirked at her speaking of which said ron we should take harry to madam pomfrey to get him cured it the only way to get out of this mess hermione i think we can do that hermione said quietly besides i really need to get rid of this prescription bottle or else the school might think i taking in pills chronically in the corner of the girl bathroom a week has passed since the incident of the harry sickness happened after they left the room of requirement hermione and ron helped harry to the hospital wing where a very concerned madam pomfrey gave harry a potion that took away all his ailments in a snap hermione finally learned her lesson on what has to be done when you want to show someone how much you like him or her just thinking about the event just brought embarrassment to her mind speaking of hermione it was another late night in the common room in the gryffindor tower as a sweating and tired hermione wrote on her essay lazily she sniffed her nose as she rubbed it sickly hermione tried to reach for her book was met with a sudden awake oooohhhh hermione moaned helplessly i i cantthink she shook off the headache and tried to continue her studying but her intense coughing caused her to cover her mouth with her knuckles this couldntget any worse i i c c cantconcentrate she squeaked with a wheeze in her breathing ohhh god she moaned and decided that it was time to turn in for the night hermione was about to fix her things when she accidentally lost balance on her stand and was about to fall of when someone caught her by the arm turning around hermione eyes met the green eyes of a very healthy harry the person where she got her current sickness from are you alright harry asked kindly smirking noooo hermione moaned shaking her head h harry i need someone to help me she glanced at her table i ll take care of it hermione but i have one thing to ask of you he looked at her seriously what she croaked do you need a nurse for the night harry asked smirking at the very sick and delicate hermione a sick person like you needs all the love in the world at the moment and with that hermione knew she couldntlove him any more than now a n if you are wondering the vicodin part of this fic pays homage to the

knew her life but never have they encountered one of the most farfetched things in their life regarding their perfect daughter it was unbelievable but probable that there was something about her that was special there was something more about her a room decorated in white wallpaper with small pink roses stretches before the visual as far as the eye can see brown furniture in uniform carvings ruled out the empty spaces in the room giving a relaxed view of the sightseer there was something in this room that doesntrely on fancy woodcarvings to show interest for others on the white mattress weighed down on the bed frames was a girl she distinctively has bushy brown hair with matching chocolate brown eyes the girl was positioned on her belly as she colored a monochromatic picture of cabinet with a set of crayons by her side the activity seemed to make her happy due to the focus and determination in her face to color this picture it wasnttoo long until she felt like she needed to use the bathroom the girl halted her coloring to use the bathroom adjacent to her room she exited the hallway and felt relieved after her bathroom use it was when she felt a queasy stir in her head that she wanted to just take a little nap after coloring but in every step she took in the red carpeted hallway she felt her head throbbing harder and harder that she started getting really annoyed about her cold getting to her it been a week since she hasntgone back it annoyed her completely thinking how much she has missed all these feelings erupted in her that she massaged her temples and started muttering complains under her breath she really felt frustrated why she had to end up like this she continued to tread down the corridor and into her room where she flung herself on her bed to continue coloring the next few minutes were headache less until another searing pain erupted around her temples her face contorted in pain as she dropped her red crayon to massage her temples it was probably best to call her mother now for the prescriptions it didntmatter if she was an hour early her head really needed it her winces evolved into breathing difficultly as her headache overwhelmed her she began to get so aggravated that she wanted to scream her own well being controlled it because if she ever tried to let out strong feelings she might do things she didntlike to happen but she couldnttake it anymore without warning she let out a hoarse scream in pain and irate for a moment she felt her mother footsteps walking briskly towards her room until the bursting sound of a wildfire erupted on her side the girl jumped in shock as she saw her cabinet burn furiously in blue flame her jump caused her to fall of her bed she watched in shock as black smoke filled the room her initial coughing began to get worse but her state of shock didntmake her move the sound of footsteps outside made her turn to see her mother walk in looking alarmed oh my she gasped wendell there a fire she yelled then the girl mother turned to her and knelt before her are you alright dear the girl nodded and felt her mother cover her mouth with cloth for her to cough in it and to block out the smoke the mother stood up and helped her child move out of the room when the girl finally spoke m my coloring book the mother spotted the coloring book nearby and thought that it was good enough to get it since the fire seemed to restrict itself at the moment she nodded to her daughter to stay at the corridor and walked towards the side of the bed where the coloring book was located the mother bent down and nearly froze for a fraction of a second when she saw what her daughter colored it was a cabinet that had colors that mimicked the blue flames around them her daughter found it fitting to color the cabinet brown too hearing the sound of the cabinet collapsing she took the coloring book without pondering what she saw and ran out when the girl father finally arrived bloody hell he gasped seeing the fire building up around the room call the fire department i ll try to take it out the mother nodded and turned to her daughter and gave her the coloring book the girl stood there looking shocked and stared at her coloring book the mother noticed how shaken she looked when she was at the page where the brown colored cabinet picture surrounded by bluish color was monica said the father from behind call them now the mother shook out of her reverie and knelt before her daughter sweetheart she asked kindly but alarmed the girl shot a look at her mother and raised her eyebrows i want you to walk out of this house and wait at the yard alright i ll just call the fire department and i ll be there with you okay the girl didntreply but stared at her mom her hands still holding up the open coloring book the commotion around them made her feel traumatized call them yelled the father the mother prodded her daughter to urge on as she looked at her mother and nodded quickly shaking the trance out of her and without hesitation she turned on her heel and ran for the staircase as her mind raced in shock and confusion at what she thought she had done while she traipsed the living room her mother ran passed her to the phone and started dialing the emergency hotline as she stared into the calendar that said it was july 31 1986 today the little girl stopped on her tracks to see her mother look frantically up the stairs and back to the calendar hello she said on the mouthpiece but the sight of her daughter made her drop it slightly and yell hermione i told you to go out now like before hermione stood there looking both confused and lost hermione can you hear me her mother said indignantly hermione hermione hermione hermione said harry hermione looked away from her transfiguration essay and turned to harry what is it she asked harry pointed out of the window and beyond the window pane against the flecks of black sky and falling snow harry snowy owl hedwig fluttered about with a letter clamped in her beak oh she squeaked in excitement and ran to the window she opened the window frame to let hedwig in harry walked to hedwig while hermione took out the letter from hedwig beak to stroke her so he can show hedwig that they were delighted she did her job hermione thanked hedwig and sat back at the table to read the missive quickly so said harry stroking hedwig are you going to tell me why you wanted to use hedwig in the first place i told you harry she said reading the letter i need to write to my parents urgently oh said harry standing up what were you writing to them about writing to them about what said ron suddenly entering from the dormitory and taking a seat on one of the squashy armchairs hermione was about to tell me harry explained and turned to hermione well wait said hermione distractedly for she was still reading the letter harry waited and stared at hermione concentration it was almost like she was reading some sort of letter that decided her fate in life cantwait till the christmas holidays come said ron distantly looking at the crackling fire me too said harry it been a hectic year it will be a great change to at least relax a bit yeah said ron he sat up straight and squeezed the armchair armrests i just hope the trip to romania will come before christmas you better see the place when it christmas his face started to look wistful it has great atmosphere delicious food and it overall a great place to stay i glad that i must go this time mum is eager to have all of us together this time a mental image of dining with the weasley in a place harry interpreted in his mind eye as romania came up he smiled at the thought of enjoying their company while in a different country excitement flooded inside him when the sound of hermione excited squeals rang around the common room oh my god she said happily running around the table she walked to harry grabbed him suddenly and pushed him to couch in front of the fire ron astounded stood up and sat on the couch beside harry what was that about ron asked incredulously hermione dragged the coffee table in front of them and sat on it and looked at harry with so much yearning that it was already creepy what harry asked at once i want to ask you something said hermione quickly her voice filled with excitement fire away said harry exchanging looks with ron er have you decided where to celebrate christmas she asked harry gave her a look of confusion until it dawned to him why she wrote a letter to her parents and how excited she looked after reading their reply why are you asking this asked ron suspiciously well said hermione putting her hands together as they rested between her knees i i was er harry looked from ron contorted face to hermione eager but hesitant face it was very obvious what hermione wanted and what ron was suspecting from her the thought of it made harry feel appreciated and flattered well ron asked sounding demanding ummm said hermione i i er for the past week i was wondering she turned away briefly from harry and ron and back to them if harry here could spend the holidays with me at my home the expressions of surprise in harry and ron faces made hermione quickly add i mean think about it i never had a christmas with my best friends usually at my home so she looked down at carpet feeling a bit embarrassed i was thinking if harry could er stay with me harry blinked he didntknow what to say but the fact that hermione wanted harry to be at her place for the holidays was somehow exciting and a bit sudden he has never seen hermione home in his life and he hardly knew her parents the sudden thought of being there for the holidays was almost interesting i wrote to my mum and dad already said hermione promptly t they said it was okay if i brought friends over how about my mum said ron loudly the bemusement in his voice was evident she expecting harry to come with us to romania i already sent an owl to your mum ron hermione explained she said it was okay as long as harry is okay with it arentyou harry ron gaped at her harry knew ron was expecting to spend the holidays with harry at romania he felt confused at the moment he didntknow what to say to her but he didnthave to heart to say no to her when it looked as if she worked very hard to get him to spend christmas with her er said harry so hermione leaned forward my mum and dad needs to know now if you ll be coming wait wait ron interrupted how about me i wanted you to come ron said hermione honestly in fact i pleaded with your mum to let you off the hook on the romania trip but she said that she wanted to have at least a complete family christmas trip now that you have percy back this still didntmake ron indignant mood improve so harry hermione turned to him er can you come harry stared at her her smile her eagerness and her twinkling eyes made him not want to reject her he liked her very much but he was going to romania with the weasleys thinking about how much fun it will be to explore around a new place with a family he can always call his own with is almost endearing but the look on hermione eyes just made him want to go with her i ll think about it harry nodded he was surprised when hermione put up a disappointed face look i really flattered that you two want me to be with you for your christmases but cantwe have a holiday with us together he turned to hermione why dontyou come with us to romania i would want to but my cousins are coming home for the holidays she then smiled slowly i i wanted them to meet my best friends when they visit this year harry and ron exchanged uncertain looks it was funny seeing hermione look nervous like this it was a bit awkward to invite harry to her house for christmas despite how long they ve known each other just give me a minute alright said harry holding her shoulder i really appreciate it hermione but i have to think this through oh said hermione twiddling her thumbs i i understand i didntsay no though remember that harry assured her smiling hermione giggled a bit and nodded at him harry then stood up and raked her bushy brown hair tenderly and walked towards the window to delve into his own thoughts hermione looked at ron who was giving her an absentminded look and saw he also deep in thought she frowned and prayed that no confusion or deceit will come up later she really wanted ron to come if only mrs weasley just allowed him to get out of the trip looking back at harry hermione wondered what he was thinking she sighed sadly trying to think positive it would be fun to spend the holidays with harry for once after ron been hogging him for the past years the only thing worried her is how harry will enjoy his time with her frankly she doesnteven know what they could do at her place it was always unusual if her place had an exciting moment and those things hardly come to pass in her life before hogwarts the six year old hermione entered the dark living room from the front door her appearance was somewhat revolting she was covered in dirt her bushy brown was tangled and she was sweating all over she didntknow how it happened all she remembered was getting out of the toilet after doing a midnight leak and before her foot landed on her carpet tiled bedroom she found herself at the town park hermione silently walked across the dark living room she prayed that no one was awake she passed the clock to see that it was around one thirty nine in the morning hermione thought that if her mum or dad found out she was here will they believe her if she told them she ended up in the park through teleportation she was about to step on the first step of the staircase when the dark room illuminated revealing a living room to her right where white neat furniture sat on the red persian carpet wreathed along the walls were green drapes designed with faded white fleur de lis behind these drapes were wide windows showcasing the side yard while the one at the front where the front yard was shown below the front window was a wide windowsill big enough for one to sit down and gaze the outdoors a brown and shiny apothecary table at the center of the room showed a couple of magazines and a cigarette tray on the shiny surface surrounding the coffee table was a long white couch facing the front window where a fireplace to left looked dry and dead facing its back to the front window two armchairs faced the couch while an end table parted the two while being in between them on top of this end table was a lamp the source of the light that illuminated the room hermione wheeled around and squeaked in horror to see her mother sitting at one of the armchairs looking very angry and worried do you have any idea how worried i have been she said in a dead serious voice the small girl gulped nervously and nodded nervously m mum she squeaked i i sit hermione instantly obeyed and sat on the couch opposite of her mother she twiddled her thumbs nervously as she looked at her knees with concentration where have you been her mother said calmly the seriousness in her voice was worse than a yell hermione thought outsi look at me snapped the mother hermione looked up quickly and stared into her mother chocolate brown eyes hermione remembered how her mother was strict when it comes to eye contact during conversations outside said hermione quietly continuing her cut off sentence from earlier it was best not to argue especially when her mother was this angry and what did i tell you about being out of bed pass curfew hermione winced t that i shouldntbe out of bed mum she said quietly and why were you out of bed hermione or out of the house rather hermione stared at her mother what should she say should she lie to her or should she tell her the truth no matter how unbelievable it sounds well her mother asked sternly hermione then recalled how she used the bathroom when she felt annoyed at how she wasntable to find her lost book she thought of how the frustration caused her to get too anxious making her have a need to use the toilet afterwards she took a step out of the bathroom and into her room but before her foot stepped on the floor she found herself in the dark children playground at the park a few blocks from her house m mum she said quietly y you m must understand this is the third time hermione said her mother fiercely making hermione jump last month i find you sneaking in the house with dirt in your hands two weeks ago you were hiding in your closet when you should be at school during that time i dontknow what you re getting at hermione jean granger but this is getting out of hand i already told you mum i dontknow how the little girl cried as she sobbed in her seat looking at her mother anxiously i i d dontk know w w w why or h how i went t to those places i j j just d d did i s s sorry if i upset you i j just cantta she cried into her hands as tears rolled down her cheeks the fact that she could never explain how she did it sunk down to her that she couldnttake it anymore what was wrong with her why is she like this it been months since her cabinet burned only finding that the contents inside were still intact and yet she didnthave a clue on how it happened it wasntthe first time though last year after her cousin hugo threw a water balloon filled with raspberry soda her anger towards him caused the thorns from her godmother rosebush to shoot at him her parents and godparents were confused at how it happened despite hugo account that hermione shot thorns at her and then again how would they believe that hermione didntknow what was wrong with her but she always feared it it made her feel tainted and marked because it will always result to the destruction of an object the pain of a loved one or someone else after all these happenings hermione finally decided that all these paranormal events tend to come from her this thought was kept to herself in fear that her parents might think she mad or crazy tonight though hermione couldnttake it she cried and cried until she started hiccupping it hurt her throat but she couldntstop losing her breath then suddenly she felt the couch give in to weight to her left hermione then felt the arms of her mother wrap around her as she calmed down her crying she leaned under her mother neck and held on to her mother nightdress for comfort for warmth for love i i s s sorry m mum hermione muttered shakily shhhh her mother crooned dontspeak hermione dontbe sorry i was just worried that you might get hurt out there hermione sniffed i dontwant to lose you hermonica said her mother stroking her daughter brown hair you are a very smart girl and me and your father will be devastated if you go missing b but hic i i d dontknow h how i g got out hermione said in a high whisper i it j just hic h happened hermione didnthear her mother reply so she continued t they re r right mum i i t think i a f freak hermione said her mother holding hermione by the shoulder as she looked into her daughter teary face listen to me and listen carefully you are not a freak b but m my c cousins and c classmates t think i am they dontknow what they are talking about hermione wiped her face with her night shirt and blinked to stop herself from tearing up again she looked at her mother and pouted helplessly look said her mother holding her daughter shoulder you are your own person your own being isntmeasured at what you can do here she pointed to hermione head but what you can feel here she placed her hand on hermione chest indicating her heart and that what matters you re a not a freak hermione you are no different you are as human as you can possibly imagine you know that and for a long time for a week hermione granger smiled the love in her heart towards her mother is what mattered she wasnta freak who cares what others say now her mother smiled down at her why dontyou get cleaned up your father doesntknow you were missing so let keep it a secret shall we hermione couldnthelp but stifle a giggle she has always shared a bond with her mother this way she was like her best friend yes mum hermione said quietly i l love you i love you too hermione her mother pulled her daughter in a maternal embrace as hermione felt that nothing in the world could harm her now not even the paranormal nor the jeers from her classmates can stop the love of her mother and that is what makes all the difference in the world snap the class backed away on their seats when professor raptor snapped a slab of thick stone into two with his wand and that he said happily is how the dark wizards of cairo created the wizarding pyramids strong charm i have to say oh look at the time he looked at his wristwatch class dismiss then hermione stood from her desk as raptor called after the exiting class reminding them about the over the holidays homework and their final practical test tomorrow on the last day of the term before christmas she packed her things away and approached to harry who was waiting for her outside by the door lunch harry asked as she approached him ron says he really hungry now sure said hermione hoisting the strap up her shoulders er where ron like i said said harry ron says he really hungry now course he is said professor raptor approaching towards them holding up three small gifts wrapped in red and green wrapping paper but i surprised that he was able to hold the appetite when i was spending the whole hour talking about mummy preparations yeck he grimaced oh yeah he handed three gifts to them happy christmas it not really my own style to give out gifts to students but i canthelp it i fond of you three t thanks professor said hermione looking startled as she took one of the parcels y you really shouldnthave well i just being generous to you three he said with a nod it my favorite time of the year after all by the way the third on is for ron so dontbother opening harry i figured that one out said harry shaking ron parcel by his ear er thanks professor dontmention it said professor raptor waving his hand off handedly as long as i see the smile plastered in your faces i know very well that there is at least one silver lining in the world we live in that sweet said hermione smiling sweeter than a candy cane i tell ya said professor raptor nodding fervently took me a while to get that quote ready in a moment one day actually he raised his index finger which took hermione and harry taken aback p professor harry asked cautiously looking at his index finger i is that a koala bear climbing at your finger it was only at this time hermione finally noticed it too when professor raptor raised his finger it gave a clear view of a very tiny koala bear climbing up and down as it grabbed onto his finger its head turned left and right staring curiously at its surroundings is that hermione asked slowly a koala bear the two looked on as professor raptor turned slowly at his finger where the tiny koala bear stared right back at him hermione was about to ask an explanation why he had an unusually tiny koala bear in his finger when she saw professor raptor glance at them from the corner of his eyes which were filled with a glint of urgency embarrassment and guilt er professor before they knew it professor raptor pushed them out of the classroom and closed shut the door as they stood there hearing the unmistakable sounds of one hammering the door with nails and planks of wood it took them a while until harry and hermione found their voices seriously said harry holding onto his and ron gifts he gets mental everyday hermione giggled and without another word about their defense against the dark arts teacher they climbed down the marble staircase with students who were off to lunch at the great hall they finally reached the first landing when hermione asked her burning question did you think about it yet she looked at harry ask about what harry asked glancing at her smirking you know what i mean hermione replied returning the smirk at him pardon my misplaced memory but can you remind me what it was harry asked as he continued to grin i serious harry said hermione hopping beside harry in a un hermione way stopping her hop when they climbed down another set of stairs i need to know alright alright said harry stopping on his tracks as they stepped in the entrance hall and wheeled around at her i was just playing anyway no i haventthought about it yet hermione tried her best not to frown for some reason she really wanted harry to give her an answer something that will tide her over for the next hour until he finally decides where he goes for the holidays w when can i expect your decision then hermione asked taking a step forward to him trying to hide her eagerness unfortunately harry eyebrows rose at the way hermione walked to him as she fumbled her fingers anxiously hermione this takes a lot of thinking to do b but i trust you d make a decision before saturday right hermione interjected i mean the holidays start on saturday hermione looked at him eagerly and was surprised that harry smiled warmly at her as he reached for her shoulders look he said slightly squeezing her shoulder i know how much you want me to go with you this year for christmas but you have to play fair for ron side oh harry said hermione in a matter of factly tone think about it you never spent a holiday in my place i i know it sounds selfish of me but i just want to spend a holiday with you hermione blushed she just realized how weird that sounded hermione admitted to herself that that last sentence sounded better in her mind than when she said it wow said harry slowly grinning at her ineptly i i cantsay that didntmake me feel touched hermione she returned his smile with a small one as she placed her hands behind her back so she looked away from him will you go and celebrate christmas with me and my family this year harry looked hesitant so with an act of desperation hermione slowly took his hand and held it with her own two ones and smiled at him tenderly harry looked at her hands touching his fingers so affectionately that he looked at her with surprise er he said nervously slowly pulling his hand away from her grasp i i ll have to think about it hermione b but later hermione said harry his voice had a tinge of edginess now lunchtime remember oh she said quietly o of course lunchtime harry then walked past her as she looked at harry earnestly feeling the christmas wind from the entrance of the entrance hall ripple her robes and bushy brown hair hermione followed harry and entered the much warmer great hall while her mind danced on what she just did to get harry answer i shouldnthave done that shaking off the mistake she just did hermione sat beside harry and ate her lunch quietly while doing her best to hide her blushes from harry trying to avoid another awkward scene hermione didntask harry about his decision for the holidays for the rest of the day she thought it was best for harry to approach to her than to go and breathe down his neck for an answer to hold her anxiousness hermione took the task to borrow hogwarts a history from the library and read it in the common room during the night before the eve of the trip back home this boded well with her since she hardly thought about harry or his decision however she would take a glance away from her book to see harry who was reading his defense against the dark arts book at the corner of the room and wonder what was he thinking turning back to hogwarts a history hermione tried to push away one negative thought what if he said no she winced at the thought of her being in her home while feeling left out at the image of harry and ron in romania having the time of their lives bouncing off the image hermione tried to think of a contingency thought to ease her disappointment if harry didntplan to go dontget too sad hermione it his choice you dont own harry the bookworm shook her head abruptly and read intently at the page regarding how apparating in hogwarts is impossible due to enchantments around the castle this could ve been a good distraction from harry if only she didntrecall how harry was absentminded about apparating in hogwarts he tends to reckon that anyone can apparate in this school shaking her head again hermione turned the page to read up on the enchanted ceiling at the great hall suggested by rowena ravenclaw the great hall enchanted ceiling is one of the founders lauded achievements at the time the ceiling would mimic the sky above giving the great hall occupants a sign on what the weather was outside the portrait hole opened reverting hermione attention towards it ron clambered in looking quite satisfied with himself ron there you are said harry closing his book hey i need to talk to you hermione looked up to see harry lead ron to the couch she was quite glad that she was tucked away in the other side of the room harry and ron then went into a conversation that sparked ron face into contortion hermione wondered if they were talking about harry decision will harry try to talk to me about it hermione frowned she knew it was childish to think it but she was hoping harry would talk to her first regarding the holidays before ron it felt aggravating that harry was holding her off for a long time now when she hasntspoken to him since lunch hermione pushed these immature feelings away while she bore into her book not that it really bothered her but she just realized how much she didntlike being pushed away from conversations she wanted to take part in it just reminded her of her days in school where people would shun her away when they had the chance primary school hermione thought in bitterness god damn primary school primary school the car pulled into a stop in front of the black gates that stretched to brick walls on either side a cobbled walkway stretched beyond leading to a handsome fa ade of a building littered with gold tinted windows at the front that when one walks on foot the reflected lights from the sun would wink at you at every step at the passenger seat hermione stared at the window with an impassive gaze well said her father following hermione gaze i ll be picking you up later in the afternoon alright hermione turned to her father and smiled at him she leaned forward to the driver seat and pecked him on the cheek love you dad she said happily opening the door hermonica said her father before she could get out hermione turned to her father at the sound of her favorite pet name she raised her eyebrows at him questioningly he leaned over at her and held out a pound sterling under her nose her eyes widened at it and looked at her father with her mouth open donttell your mother he winked at her and if you get another a by the end of the day then expect that camping trip to the forest of dean to come sooner hermione flung her arms around her father and hugged him i love you dad she repeated her words from earlier hermione pulled away and jumped out of the car she turned to the car window as it rolled down revealing her father face be here when i pick you up hermione hermione waved at the departing car and turned to the black gates to begin another day in her primary education a few minutes later she found herself sitting at the front seat reading her mathematics book her engrossed state towards the book made her barely notice the two boys talking among themselves as they cast mischievous looks at her the chattering class silenced when a woman with spanish decent entered the room and surveyed them with her welcoming smile good morning class she greeted good morning mrs lecciones the class replied alright said mrs lecciones today we will begin with simple word problems i believe you all practiced your problem solving hermione nodded intently her teacher beamed at her we ll see with today activity she said taking out a book identical to hermione math book i would like all of you to turn to page twenty four and answer the following a moment later hermione was already jotting down her answers in the word problem given the way she instantly answered everything in a matter of time was something to behold by the casual eye she reviewed her work and with the feeling of satisfaction in the end she raised her hand i finished mrs lecciones she said eagerly i finished mrs lecciones one of the boys from behind imitated with a baby like voice emitting the class in a slow ripple of laughter hermione turned and glared at the boy now now mr turner said mrs lecciones sternly i donttolerate teasing in my class remember what i said donthumiliate one who does good deeds for everyone hermione turned to her teacher and smiled weakly if you keep that in mind the teacher said then i hope you learn something from it anyway she turned to hermione you said you were finished miss granger hermione nodded excitedly and gave her book to her teacher mrs lecciones observed the book behind her spectacles after a few minutes of looking into it she looked at hermione and beamed this is excellent miss granger she said handing the book to hermione revealing a large a at the upper right corner congratulations how did you do that hermione asked hermione companion thirty minutes later as they left the classroom i study john said hermione in a matter of factly tone i dontreally think i did something unusual you re the smartest girl in class hermione said john you cantsay no to that hermione smiled at john he was slightly taller than her and has jet black hair he had pale green eyes and is quite thin for his age for all the life she has lived john has been there for her since forever he understood her every motive and never left her side ever since john returned the smile to her as they walked down the corridor how did you do in today activity hermione asked not bad said john wincing at least i didntfail you really donthave to feel down in the dumps you know said hermione it just takes practice lots of rubbish if you ask me mocked a voice from behind hermione and john wheeled around to see the two boys from earlier walking up to them hermione glared at them and urged john to keep moving not so fast said one of the boys we would like to congratulate you for your effort hermione didntlook amused yes said the other boy we would like to thank you how your big head gives our class a standout front whenever students compare ignore them hermione said john l let just keep moving oh does wittle johnny want to get out of twoble said the first boy mockingly the second boy laughed does wittle johnny like to go home to his big mommy john ears turned red d dontsay that about my mum lyle he cried stomping the floor with his foot what are you going to do eh said lyle grinning smugly cry leave him alone said hermione coldly her fist shaking oooohhh said the two boys mockingly it looks like granger the stranger is defending her boyfriend to hermione surprise john turned scarlet she looked at him with a pitiful look before turning to the two boys a small crowd was already watching them be quiet hermione spat if you dontwant to get in trouble you re going to tell on us again lyle challenged that the best thing you can do isntthat right dustin that and be a know it all said dustin mockingly hermione shook in anger she has never been this angry in a long time her insides were burning as she glared the two laughing boys with utmost hate her stomach bubbled in anger as she somehow felt almost dazed uh oh said lyle doing a mock imitation of trying to hide behind his hands looks like granger the stranger is going to let it all out again it fine granger said dustin crossing his arms grinning let it all out we all know that you want to tell the teacher but what the good in it when you can fight back dontbe a coward said lyle mockingly then made mimicked a chicken hermione eyes did an unusual thing its vision flickered in and out of focus as if someone was adjusting lenses in a camera she didntcare about this strange thing due to her temper rising if only she could just run and punch them in the face h hermione said john warily let j just go alright but whether she tried to think about letting go hermione will never find out it all happened in a second bang hermione jumped as she watched in horror as blue colored flames erupted at the heads of the two boys they boys screamed as they ran around the hallway making spectators gasp and run from the commotion hermione took john by the wrist and led him farther from the scene as the ceiling sprinklers activated making the whole hallway wet hermione called john when he realized hermione stopped on her tracks as students ran passed him with her bushy brown hair plastered on her face hermione looked at the farther part of the hallway to see the two boys she loathed running around flailing their arms yelling out help hermione thought it would be funny to see them like this in her mind eye but after seeing the real thing it looked horrible hermione said john as he walked to her you re getting wet we have to go out hermione wasntlistening she was staring intently at the dancing blue flames that were burning the scalps of lyle and dustin the sprinklers were emitting so much water it was strange that blue flames didntextinguish and then again since when do flames turn blue h hermione said john shakily w we better get going shaking out of her reverie hermione nodded and with one last enigmatic look at the boys she followed john outside to the school courtyard where almost everyone in the school gathered there looking drenched while they shivered at the morning air hey hermione yes johnny hermione looked mechanically up at harry who was standing behind one of the chairs harry eyebrows rose what did you just call me he asked giving her a puzzled look realizing what she said hermione blinked and recovered herself s sorry she said turning a bit pink i i t thought thought what that harry was john you called me johnny said harry casually smirking at her are you alright and who johnny your boyfriend hermione frowned at harry as a glint of annoyance erupted in her stomach her expression seemed obvious since harry face turned from amusement to caution er i um never mind harry scratched his head awkwardly anyway you re reading hogwarts a history again well said hermione conversationally her annoyance ebbing away it for light reading really but you know the book by heart hermy said harry relieved that he didnttrigger her temper what the point of reading it hermione smiled i just want to read it again i mean it my comparative to a quidditch game and dontcall me hermy harry laughed touche he said holding onto the seat in front of him nice analogy by the way thanks said hermione putting the book down but i insinuate you to at least read the book before you leave hogwarts harry it quite a good read never in my life hermione said harry shaking his head i really donthave the man power then test your man power to at least take a peek said hermione sharply who knows you might learn something from here and you wontat least sound strange when you mention a few inconsistencies hermione said harry i serious i dontthink i will read hogwarts a history even if you paid me five hundred galleons said hermione smiling at him i just kidding but are you serious not even try out of an emotion or something nope said harry nodding with finality even if my life depended on it even if i offered you a whole year of my services in doing your homework hermione challenged humorously ha over your dead body harry replied knocking on the wood surface three times face it hermione i doubt i will read hogwarts a history ever fine said hermione flicking a page of the said book your boat not mine indeed harry said with a nod but i didntcome here to tell you about your book ron he nodded to ron who hermione realized was standing beside her tell her ron cleared his throat harry he gestured to harry has decided that he will go with me to romania for the holidays instead of going with you a silence rang into hermione ears as the words finally sunk in she found it unusual that her mouth opened slightly as an empty filling started welling up inside her her sheer disappointment surprised her she didntexpect how disappointed she would feel at harry decision hermione really felt that harry would say yes hermione harry asked well reality fell back to her head when she stared into harry green eyes what was she going to say honestly she felt really disappointed and saddened at this she felt really ashamed that she felt her eyes feeling warmer er she finally spoke but in a rather croaky voice i it all good she nodded keeping her voice casually calm i i well good for you she raised her hands to attempt an image of joy i er d dontmind i m mean that if you want to go there i cantstop you or anything that hermione bit her lip as she took an intake of breath she avoided harry eyes to hide the emotion in her face the last thing she wanted was for harry to see her like this oh how stupid he d think of her erm i i need to go to bed said hermione standing up not looking at harry she suddenly felt very annoyed with him merry christmas and goodnight she said but felt that she addressed it more to ron than to harry without looking at harry and ron ignoring her hogwarts a history book hermione turned towards the dormitory feeling unusually hurt and downtrodden before hearing a burst of laughter from behind hermione turned around and saw ron laughing as he held his stomach harry was giving her a smirk that showed slyness she wasntstupid enough to realize why they were laughing you she shot daggers at ron and harry tears falling down her cheeks you two are bastards she lunged for them as the two boys dodged her move running around the couch as she called out to them in rage you two know how much this would mean to me she stood in front of the couch glaring at harry and ron who were behind the couch sniggering she found it embarrassing that she allowed her tears to glisten her cheeks i cant believe you two would do that stop laughing harry and ron stopped their laughing and were now looking at hermione their faces startled when they noted her hurt face and what little her tears did to her cheeks sorry hermione said harry quickly looking apologetic m me and ron were just bluffing you it was typical hermione thought typical for them to think up of a clever ruse to make her feel this way when she worked so hard to convince mrs weasley and her mum to allow harry to spend the holidays with her harry must ve guessed her reaction towards a no and thought it wise to let ron in to joke her about it how inconsiderate of him but then again he was bluffing the whole thing which made a mental mallet hit her in the head ignoring her sudden outburst hermione said in a hoarse voice y you s said you were bluffing and at this moment harry and ron sighed in relief hermione was glad the common room was almost empty imagine the faces of a huge crowd if they were to see this scene it was ron who spoke this time yes hermione he said sagely we were bluffing you harry is not going to romania with me he has decided to spend the holidays with you hermione jaw dropped and looked at harry genuine smirk wiping the tears from her cheeks hermione looked at harry again and saw his nod of approval and ignoring her senses ignoring the fact that she looked like a happy child receiving her presents on christmas day as she let out a squeal and ran around the couch and flung her arms around harry hermione harry gasped take it easy s sorry said hermione pushing away from him all pink in the face her eyes beaming at him i i just oh harry are you joking again nope said harry i finally spoke to ron about it and i told him that i want to go with you this year ron was fine with it of course he gestured to ron as ron appeared at harry shoulder yeah said ron grinning not that i happy with it he attempted to look angry but couldntsuppress his grin you know since my two best friends arentthere hermione couldnthelp but fling her arms around ron which made him quite taken aback thank you so much ron said hermione releasing him from her grip i was worried that you might take it bad if harry chose come off it hermy said ron waving a hand just make sure you get me something good for christmas this year i will i promise said hermione and turned to harry by the way i cantlie that your little joke made me feel hurt inside yeah we know said harry wincing i sorry it didntreally matter though hermione beamed at harry with so much happiness she wanted to punch the air because one thing is for sure for the holidays and that is harry potter her best friend is going to spend time with her at her home for christmas hermione granger jumped out of the car and found herself facing the front yard of her house she sighed at the image of it and thought of going inside her bedroom to take a nice long afternoon map before getting into studying leaving her father to do his business at maintaining the car hermione walked down the front yards stony step as she skipped playfully at the tiles for her the red tiles meant lava while the grey ones meant a safe passage to hope on after hopping on her fifth tile hermione nearly lost balance when she saw four owls perched on the railings that surround the front porch gaining her footing hermione looked curiously at the owls and wondered why they were there in broad daylight aligned on the railings from left to right was a snowy owl a screech a tawny and a minute owl she had this instant feeling that she was being watched by them as they turned their heads towards her why are they staring at me can owls do that feeling a bit spooked hermione desisted her skipping and decided to walk inside immediately as she did she noticed at the corner of her eye that the owls heads were following her as she walked up the steps and onto the porch landing before entering through the screen door to her house with her hand on the doorknob hermione turned to the owls and saw that they were still staring at her one of them hooted at her which hermione felt that it was greeting her what are you thinking owls cantgreet people shoo said hermione stomping on the ground to scare them off go away shoo the owls didntbudge but they continued to stand there boring into her brown eyes with their wide ones hermione felt the hairs at the back of her head stand on end a bit as the snowy owl eyes grew this is getting scary hermione immediately turned to the door and opened it ignoring the fact that the tawny and the minute owl flew around the house and rested on a tree branch overlooking the curtained windows of her room where she entered the young girl of the grangers happily entered her room and ran for the calendar as she checked the date ooooh she said happily crossing out a square that represented a date on the calendar looks like i only have four months until i reach the day hermione she spoke to herself softly hermione sighed and scanned the calendar as her eyes finally set itself upon the square under the ninth page of the calendar septermber 19 1990 my 11 th birthday reading the square again hermione smirked at it thinking of how special that day would be for once in her life she was finally going to look forward to meet new set of people when she journeys into secondary school when september hits i ll show them she said under breath i ll show them all that i am better than them and with that hermione granger left the room for the bathroom outside closing the door behind her while oblivious to the fact that more than a dozen owls were perched on top of her house where they will wait for another full year until the little girl living in this place becomes of age for a place far beyond this place when the year of nineteen ninety one comes into view in the coming months to be continued busy college work is busy college work season 2 finale xxxvi hermione granger part iii it was the summer of 1991 alice hermione hermione ran to the living room as she descended the stairs to hug her cousin who sat on the couch her mother father and aunt elphaba beamed at the two hugging girls as they sat in their seats i so glad you re here said hermione pulling away from alice to look at her aunt elphaba a brunette woman who has always loved green colored clothing today she was wearing a green sweater i couldntsleep last night out of excitement alice was excited too said elphaba she refused to sleep on the way here and asked your father a lot of questions regarding you hermione beamed at her cousin who beamed back today alice wore a sky blue sundress with a white apron like garment in front of her skirt tied around the top of her dark blonde hair was a black ribbon that served as a hairband when did you arrive just this morning around five o clock said her father obviously exhausted from fetching them from the airport we had to avoid the morning traffic so it was quite a bit of a long ride than expected at least we were able to arrive here in time for hermione to wake up right really jacques we thank you for going to that trouble getting us here said elphaba it no problem said jacques beaming at his sister hermonica allie hermione and alice turned their heads to jacques hermione father smiled at the two girls and looked at hermione and spoke your mother then nodded to alice your aunt baked cookies for the two of you in the dining room i think i know two young girls who would love a mouthful eh the two girls enthusiastically raised their hands in the air as if they were in a class jacques chuckled and turned to alice i think my favorite niece would like a carry to the kitchen alice nodded adorably and raised her arms as jacques carried her by the back and the bend under her knees carry me daddy hermione said jumping on the balls of her feet there still some room up here jacques jerked his head sideways to point out his back hop on then hermione stepped on the couch and flung her arms around her father as he bent over a bit to give her a better leveling to the kitchen we go said jacques as he playfully carried the two girls to the kitchen swaying left and right as hermione and alice giggled uncle we might hit the wall alice cried jacques granger wontallow his little girls to get hurt would he he said sagely smirking down at alice hermione giggled from above and smiled down at alice over her dad shoulder alice looked up and caught hermione eye they smiled at each other i guess not uncle alice said then what are we waiting for said jacques the cookies are waiting and with that said jacques carried the girls to the dining room where delicious cookies awaited the girls who were deemed inseparable by their uncles aunts parents and family members alike hermione cared for alice as alice cared for hermione hermione cut half a piece of her cookie to share with alice which was returned when alice gave hermione her iced tea it was inevitable that the two would consider each other as sisters since they look unusually alike i actually thought they were twin sisters before i found out they were cousins one would say during gatherings or at parties it was a love that bloomed between them they loved each other dearly and it was because of the long gap between them that caused their separation that their hearts grew fonder as they missed each other whenever it wasntsummer but as it was the time of their reunion they were whole once more in each others care and presence oh alice gasped as her cookie fell to the ground sorry she added apologetically as she twisted her torso around to reach for the ground i ll get that allie said hermione kindly walking around to pick up the fallen cookie you know that you deserve all my care here take mine she dragged her plate of cookies to alice i ll just throw this in the rubbish bin thank you alice smiled at hermione you re the best cousin ever same here said hermione smiling back like you said together we re unlimited unlimited alice repeated happily as the girls happily ate and drank in the dining room of the good summer morning this was the big surprise we were hiding from you hermione said monica walking over to hermione side we know it been four years aunt elphaba and i decided that we should let alice arrive here two days in advance said monica happily she and aunt glinda will come here two days from now we ve been planning it since last month said jacques beaming at the girls i ve been very willing said alice casually smiling her best smile that hermione usually found very pleasant on a normal day but at this moment she thought alice was showing off alice was quite excited said jacques after her last visit we were quite amazed on what will happen next then he lowered his voice we miss you so much allie and we will be glad to have our favorite niece in the house again said monica happily that nice said alice in her adorably usual high gentle american accented voice that had a tinge of british accent smiling at her aunt monica i cantwait for what coming coincidence though said jacques nodding to harry hermione here brought her best friend to celebrate the festivities with us the granger way oh said alice looking at harry i think i will be very much interested to er get to know the best friend of my cousin dearest hermione fumed she clubbed her fist like a ball and hid her shaking fist under her pockets as she glared at harry who was speaking quite nervously er hermione d didnttell me that s she had a cousin harry said sheepishly i i mean you to be specific harry added of course said alice hermione doesnthave the obligation to tell others about her cousins i bet she has more important things to do isntthat right hermione hermione fixed her face to look casual as alice and harry turned to her yes said hermione quietly loathing unadulterated loathing i loathe your face your voice and your clothing hermione whispered dangerously that only she can hear herself whispering hermione clearly loathed her how dinah hermione suddenly asked in a mechanical voice she fine said alice coolly i wasntable to bring her because i was afraid she might be too much of a handful i ll give you a handful girls said jacques walking up to them hermione why dontyou go and help alice to the guestroom i bet you know where it is allie jacques turned to alice of course uncle jac jac said alice sweetly suck up excellent nodded jacques you two do that while harry and i he looked at harry will get a little reintroduction harry shot hermione a cautious look abandoning all her feelings towards alice hermione nodded him in support she knew this would come especially with her father knack of asking questions regarding her ugh he can be too protective at times just like with john hermione pursed her lips as her raging emotions dropped on her head she furtively glared at alice who was hoisting her rucksack up to her shoulders hermione can you help alice with her luggage while i get her lunch ready monica asked kindly hermione nodded to her mother she turned to see her father lead harry to sit down at the couch in the living room with a weak smile at harry hermione turned to alice who looked back at her where your luggage just one alice turned to a large brown bag that hermione failed to notice do you need i can do it said hermione sternly picking up the bag the moment she pulled the straps she was hoisted down as the weight of the bag overcame her this is heavy hermione exhaled and turned to alice do you need help she asked harmoniously hermione scowled and halfheartedly scoffed as she stood up to full height i ll take that as yes said alice picking up the first strap go on hermione picked up the second strap and together the two girls carried it up to the staircase nothing has changed said alice serenely stepping up on the landing of the second floor obviously hermione muttered rolling her eyes as she tore them away from harry and her father who conversed in the living room harry looked quite nervous hermione brought alice to the guestroom which was located right across her bedroom hermione opened the door and realized that she hasntbeen here for months now unlike her pink bedroom this one was color blue and was much larger the room was wide enough to fit four people due to the two queen size beds that were placed a meter apart from each other the room was comfortably lit and had the air of sophistication the white drapes blocked the outdoor view that the windows would usually give hermione looked around and saw a full body mirror at the corner of the room on the side of the room was a white personal computer it been awhile said alice entering the bedroom as she dropped the handle of her brown bag hermione had to regain balance as the weight of the bag fell does that have internet she pointed to computer yes said hermione lamely not looking at alice good i can e mail my mom and dad alice dropped her rucksack on the first bed and observed the room she sat on the bed and hopped on it to test the softness of it hermione dragged the bag to the corner of the room and huffed hermione looked back to see alice brushing her dark blonde hair hermione loathed herself for admitting it but she had to alice has beautiful hair i think we should go down hermione said quietly walking up to the door i think we should said alice standing up as she followed hermione out of the room er hermione hermione turned to alice and was expecting some sort of sly leer from her cousin but was surprise that alice was wearing a look of seriousness much unlike alice s what hermione asked alice hesitantly opened her mouth then closed it do you have anything worth saying hermione seethed not keen to hide her loathing to hermione surprise alice face went into a mix of irate and hurt fine said alice regaining her cool lead the way hermione the two girls climbed down the stairs to the living room where jacques was still talking to harry ah hermione said jacques gesturing her to approach him i was just talking to harry here and he said that you re the first female best friend he has in his life hermione beamed at harry who nodded awkwardly at her a soft scoff rang to the side of hermione ears as she turned to see alice appear at her side hermione glared at alice and turned to her father well father said hermione frankly we initially went on the wrong foot oh really hermione father boomed making harry jump wrong foot eh he turned to harry briskly what did you do to my daughter did you bully her dad hermione cried sitting beside harry dontmind him he like that just watching out for my daughter safety hermonica said jacques hermione dad hermione blushed after hearing harry chuckle you should hear her other nickname said alice instantly that everyone turned to her w what other nickname hermione asked mechanically shooting a cautious look at alice did she have another one yeah what nickname harry asked clearly looking quite amused ah yes said jacques joyfully kiwi was it yeah said alice grinning that the one hermione eyes widened as her face turned brick red how could she forget that kiwi harry asked amusingly turning to hermione kiwi you donthave to say it twice harry hermione spat blushing but why didntyou tell me or ron harry asked grinning from ear to ear i i hermione blushed i i dontknow circumstances ah alice said hermione father come here and sit i was just talking to hermione best friend here er harry said alice sitting on the white couch smiling at harry his name is harry harry chuckled nervously and hermione began to shoot daggers at alice ha ha jacques chuckled looks like you two are getting quite acquainted not in my watch hermione growled did you say something hermione harry asked no said hermione immediately harry said jacques i think you should be reintroduced to my niece he gestured to alice who smiled at her uncle her name is alice lindell granger said jacques allie why dontyou tell harry more about yourself i think your aunt will need another hand in the kitchen as alice waved to jacques who exited the room hermione turned to harry and whispered what did my dad tell you that his name was jacques wendell granger then he just asked questions harry said turning slightly pink you know if i was taking care of you or if i was er taking advantage by doing things hermione brow furrowed doing what things i i dunno said harry not looking at hermione i mean he nice b but i cantbelieve he actually asked th that my dad is like that said hermione supportively he just humoring you if he does that then that means he likes you quite strange for him to express that said harry darkly he ll like you in due time said hermione pointedly i swear while waiting you have to tell me about the back story of your nickname kiwi said harry grinning broadly at her before hermione could retort alice made a coughing sound mind if i join in your conversation she asked n no said harry gingerly not at all good said alice hey hermione squeaked in a split and surprising second hermione gasped in surprise as alice flung herself to the couch squeezing herself in between harry and hermione hi said alice looking at harry i think we ve met that scarlet woman hermione whispered angrily fixing herself up to see alice smiling at harry broadly y yeah said harry er you remember me right harry i just said your name awhile ago harry said alice playfully her eyes twinkling just in case my name is alice i beautifully tragic hermione did a big eye roll at this and looked over alice shoulder to see harry looking unusually flushed call me allie said alice turning sideways and saying aloud that what my friends call me why you hermione muttered before she heard her mother call her hermonica come here i need you to help me with something hermione harry and alice turned to the dining room archway where jacques appeared at the threshold hermione your mother calling you b but dontworry i ll keep harry company while you re away alice said hermione face turned murderous and without giving the satisfaction to alice that she ticked her off hermione did not look at her or at harry i coming said hermione nonchalantly hermione walked across the living room and was about to go through the archway into the dining room when she stopped on her tracks to look at harry and alice who were talking quite animatedly though hermione noted how alice was doing all the talking while harry spoke nervously i heard hermione say a name called dinah harry voice said dinah my white rabbit she said happily i have pictures in my bag if you want to see them later she very white till the last fur i bet there something else that also white that you want to show to harry in your damn bag hermione clenched her teeth and pushed her emotions away as her mother called her for the second time done said a young hermione happily walking up to the bed to sit on the side showing alice her drawing alice who was lying down on the bed her legs propped neatly in a straight line said it beautiful kiwi really said hermione looking at her picture i always thought yours are better though i donthave a talent in drawing to be honest said alice sadly you do said hermione how do you think i started drawing anyway alice looked at hermione skeptically sorry hermione i donthave a clue from you said hermione smiling me yeah said hermione ever since i saw your drawing of the waterfall the one that won you first place remember anyway when i saw that it made me want to draw be like you alice did not say anything but she smiled broadly you know said alice i ve had so many friends but only one that mattered the two girls beamed at each other and without further ado hermione leaned and gave her cousin a one armed squeeze unlimited hermione hummed leaning away from alice together we re unlimited you made our motto into a song alice said amusingly n not really said hermione twisting a lock of her hair i it just popped into my head that all well if we have time said alice maybe we can work on something the summer just started after all hermione giggled but why dontwe start with small things hermione said besides the boy i told you about johnny he coming over you know i want you to meet him he my other best friend whenever you re not around really said alice smiling i cantwait you two will get along really well i believe said hermione happily i hope so said alice pulling down her skirt how long have you and this boy known each other not too long maybe more than two years now hermione said oh alice fingered her lower lip thoughtfully then giggled i hope he funny i like funny people he can be a bit awkward to be honest said hermione i mean he can say things randomly and wontmean it then he gets all flustered for acting like that yeah he is funny the girls giggled so what are you doing today alice asked placing her hands on her lap nothing but spend time with you said hermione what do you want to do i know said alice maybe when johnny arrives we can play dodgeball allie i dontthink that would be er appropriate hermione winced well you know hermione looked at her bed where alice sat on c mon hermione said alice her voice becoming squeaky as it did so often i can always stay in one place but you might get hurt said hermione i very protective about you i know that kiwi said alice looking down at her knees i just want some energetic fun that all hey allie said hermione putting an arm around her dontworry you ll get your energetic fun when john arrives he ll prove to you that you dontneed to run around to have fun like board games said alice smirking we dontneed to run around right correct said hermione happily i know why dontwe play a board game i like monopoly alice clapped her hands excitedly hermione nodded and walked over to a shelf at the corner that held most of her possessions mostly books she looked up and saw three board games stacked above monopoly trivial pursuit and operation using a footstool hermione stepped up and took the monopoly board game and turned to place the monopoly board game on the foot of the bed oh yeah said hermione i forgot about the play money she usually kept the play money of her monopoly board game in a safe place to avoid an inevitable loss hermione walked over the dresser and pulled the drawer oh hermione gasped in realization what wrong alice asked from behind hermione looked below the drawer she opened to see the mysterious letter she received a week ago it was staring back at her with the green letters boring her name address and its yellowish splendor she looked at it intriguingly and picked it up to observe it once more what that hermione alice asked turning over the letter to see the candle wax seal hermione turned to alice it a letter she said from who from who was the question hermione thought until now she has never opened it and somehow forgot about looking into it due to her excitement over alice arrival i i not sure said hermione why dontyou open it hermione hesitated and had a strong feeling to rip the missive as alice suggested for a second there hermione thought the letter started whispering at her to open it feeling a bit spooked hermione shoved the letter on the top of the dresser took the play money from drawer and walked back to alice i ll open it some other time said hermione with a hint of finality anyway monopoly is waiting allie goodie said alice happily as they played their board game hermione and alice forgot to note how an owl passed by the window sorry mum said hermione entering through the kitchen what do you need i think harry and alice would like some iced tea said monica pointing a tray of iced tea on the counter i doubt it would hurt to offer harry another one hermione nodded to her mother and carried the tray to the living room where alice and harry were conversing hermione neared them enough to catch the tails of what alice was saying then this tower of cards fell over me alice exclaimed before i could do anything i woke up from where i started by the lake with my mom it turned out to be a dream or at least i think it was a dream it must ve been one harry said timidly i mean talking animals a white rabbit that can tell time a queen of cards it quite an imagination it felt so real though said alice but it was really a dream because my mom said i was squirming on the spot while i slept hermione harry said catching hermione carrying a tray of iced tea hi said hermione stiffly i brought you iced tea for your liking hermione harry repeated standing up as he reached for the tray it alright i ll carry that for you i fine harry said hermione irritably pulling the tray from harry reach just sit down you re the guest i insist harry implored looking uneasy hermione knew that harry was too modest i fine said hermione insistently hermione said alice i think it only fair that we also take the burden as hostess dontbe too modest said hermione icily i just trying to be polite alice replied coolly hermione rolled her eyes then harry said hermione here you donthave to carry everything for us really harry just let me put this down hermione go easy on harry he just trying to be a gentleman alice suddenly said hermione stared at alice as if she was something nasty harry chuckled nervously oh of course hermione suddenly said loudly that made harry jump silly me she clumsily placed the tray on the table then turned to harry i sorry harry for being too high maintenance at you her voice was high and very irritable pardon my rudeness at ignoring that harry wants to be a gentleman without a word hermione spun on her heel and walked quickly out of the living room up to the shelter of her bedroom she locked the door and flung herself on her bed and groaned for pete sake hermione she scolded herself placing her hands to her face why did you have to burst like that she thought it felt too immature to bite alice head off then again hermione thought it was a justified action dontbe stupid hermione you know very well that that wasntjustified but she hated her so much am i willing to throw away my dignity just to hate her for who she is how shallow of you hermione hermione groaned hermione felt confused the bubbling hate she has towards alice confused her what if alice changed it been four years since she met alice seriously what if she changed impossible the way she spoke and walk was still the same thing from four years ago hermione groaned and slapped her forehead hoping that the moment she gets out of the room she would ve been in a dream it been four years since then ever since that event four years ago hermione and alice drifted apart until now neither hermione nor alice told their families that they loathed each other so far the family of the grangers still believes that hermione and alice were still an inseparable duo everything was a lie though hermione and alice never spoke to each other in four years all because of a pivotal disagreement that led to a lot of chain reactions that jeopardized everything hermione cared for hermione went silent for the next few minute expecting someone knocking on her door probably harry but no one came everything was silent in her room hermione turned to see her clock on the wall it was already half past one in the afternoon she looked at the ceiling and stared at the rigged texture which she and her mother worked on years ago by rolling a roller brush in a unique way to make that kind of texture cool down hermione feeling her irritable attitude die away she sighed slowly and began to hum a tune as she hummed it hermione closed her eyes and absentmindedly counted the white dots that danced in the darkness of her closed eyes after a few minutes she parted her lips and sang i ve heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason bringing something we must learn and we are led to those who helped us most to grow if we let them and we helped them in return well i dontknow if i believe that true i know who i am today because i knew you hermione instantly gasped opened her eyes breathed deeply and began to be aware that her eyes were watery wiping her eyes with her sleeve she lifted her head to look at the door should harry come up and check on me it was a strange thought but knowing harry hermione expected him to come up to ask her if she was okay dropping her head on the bed hermione bit her lip to not let the song she sang awhile ago escape her lips again that was our song hermione sighed sadly and recalled the last time they sung the incomplete composition the song she sang was an unfinished song it was meant to be finished but until now after new circumstances hermione thought that it will never be finished we both live new lives now and for thinking that she wanted to finish the song hermione somehow hated herself for that hermione got off her bed and walked to her dresser she looked at the mirror and saw her gloomy reflection staring back at her she tried to smile but all she got was a sad one it then occurred to her that her mirror was framed with pictures of her harry and ron in numerous locations in hogwarts the surface of the dresser was picture free and all was present was a couple of bottles that contained perfume her mother friends gave her a summer ago to the right there was a large encyclopedia and to the left of the dresser was a white powder puff that looked rather dirty feeling the need for it hermione checked her drawers and found nothing but old objects that were probably there for years a piece of rectangular yellow plastic that probably belonged to a toy a pencil post its cotton etcetera obviously these things did not interest her as she closed the drawers it was at the last drawer that hermione finally found something that interested her lying at the corner was a small slab of yellow transparent solid hermione picked it up and felt the smooth and firm object with her fingers wow hermione whispered after all this time she thought she lost it but she felt quite relieved that this piece of resin was still in her dresser a sudden thought his her mind should i take it out hermione rubbed the resin with her thumb and bit her lip maybe it wasnta bad idea for her to do what she wanted to do at the moment knock knock knock instantly the bookworm rushed to the door and opened it expecting that it was harry to her surprise and disappointment it was her mother hermione there you are said monica what is it mum i was just looking for you tell you an important matter mostly because you ll probably love it monica smiled at her daughter w what do you mean i just got off the phone with your grandfather jack hermione eyes widened grand p re hermione said quietly monica nodded beaming at her yes him anyway remember how the tradition goes when relatives arrive to be with us in england said monica hermione smiled broadly w we go to grand p re country home i knew you d give that face the moment i ll tell you the news said monica happily s so we re going there hermione said excitedly ignoring that she looked like a little girl receiving sweets we re going to spend the holidays there yes we are hermione said monica i just going to give you a heads up so that way you can prepare early because i know how much you love your grandfather of course hermione grandfather jack granger took care of hermione when she was young telling her all sort of stories and interesting facts and figures it was because of her grandfather whom she affectionately calls grand p re as in peh reh that hermione learned the love and joy of reading and learning new things out of all of his grandchildren jack loved hermione the most due to the fact that she was the only grandchild in england whilst the rest that being elphaba and her children lived in the united states when hermione grandmother died more than a decade ago hermione kept her grandfather company and through that bonding that hermione began to learn the joys of being studious she brought joy to his heart that her grandfather valued hermione very much that she kept on getting very expensive gifts from him whenever a special occasion comes you look excited said monica her eyes twinkling at hermione hermione smiled sweetly at her mother and hugged her this is going to be great mum said hermione pulling away harry can see the family country home i was thinking that too said monica that way we wonthave to be in the burden of keeping everyone in the house the country home has more guest rooms when are we leaving for grand p re i expecting the day after elphaba and glinda arrives monica explained but alas we ll find out soon when they get here alright o okay said hermione calmly trying to hold in her happiness now what are you doing here her mother asked shouldntyou be down there with harry and allie hermione winced and smiled weakly at her mother what the matter dear n nothing said hermione looking away from her mum i i just got something to think about for a moment oh hermione said monica dearly hermione turned and saw her mother looking at her with concern you miss him dontyou she asked a saddening jolt sparked within hermione that wasntwhat she was thinking at the moment but then again things are looking like they re happening again you know harry looks so much like him said monica except that harry has brilliant green eyes hermione looked down at the ground and wished her mother would stop she didntneed to go and listen to this i miss him hermione admitted b but it probably the best that i learn to move on mum hermione said quietly that good said monica approvingly though i canthelp but notice that harry and alice are getting along quite nicely hermione looked after at her mother who was walking away down the corridor what do you mean her mother stopped turned to her daughter briefly and spoke i mean it like having john around the house again without a word monica left hermione alone by the threshold where she thought of nothing but what her mother said all the while that the thought of visiting her grand p re will ease her anxiety towards alice among many things hermione clambered down the staircase a few minutes later and met harry on the way down harry hermione said in surprise where were you harry asked with concern the moment you burst out like that i couldntthink why you d do that i sorry harry said hermione automatically sounding quite sad than she intended a are you alright hermione harry looked at her chocolate brown eyes you seem quite puffy i fine harry hermione smiled at him i just tired that all what that in your hand harry looked at her fumbling fingers at her right hand hermione stared down and saw she was holding a slab of solid resin of color amber it just something i picked up in my room said hermione simply she felt odd for some reason oh but are you alright harry held her by the shoulder i fine harry hermione said serenely i just wanted to see you that all what harry looked at her confusingly i i mean i wanted to come down here to see what up with you hermione said quickly well things are doing okay here alice is quite an interesting girl harry said timidly dontthink just speak how is she hermione asked casually she very nice i have to admit said harry smiling she has the most adorable voice getting a crush already hermione suddenly blurted out w what harry looked at her disbelievingly turning slightly red whatever gave you that idea oh nothing said hermione innocently walking pass harry it just that you seem to be sooo interested in her before harry could answer alice appeared from the kitchen with a cookie on her right hand and a glass of milk in the other harry you have to taste this it really delicious alice said walking up to them oh hi hermione she added when she caught sight of her cousin dontbe intimidated hi alice hermione replied sounding icy than she intended where were you after you gave us the iced tea i mean you suddenly disappeared like that alice snapped her fingers i was thinking of some things said hermione oh said alice well you should really try to at least talk with harry here because he seemed to be very worried about you afterwards hermione glanced at harry then back to alice oh well said alice considering that you re the brains of the family i cantblame for your brooding nature hermione bit her lip from saying anything anyway she turned to harry would yo u like a cookie s sure said harry nervously there a plate over there in the kitchen you must try some aunt monica makes the most delicious cookies she said in her distinctive high gentle voice harry nodded automatically and looked at hermione you want to come sorry said hermione glaring at harry for the first time ever since they arrived i busy preparing for aunt glinda and aunt elphaba arrival suddenly alice answered it too bad though i know how much you really love them hermione alice said unusually talking in an even voice but then again you might be too busy with your schoolwork why dontyou do what you love and go to the bedroom and entertain yourself by opening a book without all the control in her boiling heart hermione with a deadly glare at alice said in a dangerous voice oh oh alright she smiled in a rather creepy way i i ll do that and open a book in bedroom oh wait i know while i do that why dontyou go to the corner street and entertain a man by opening your legs hermione harry gasped hermione glared at alice with all the hate she had for her alice however wasntglaring in fact she looked extremely hurt and intimidated but kept a firm ground on her part the ringing silence continued on as hermione began to register alice features to her surprise alice looked saddened but a loathing expression was still profound in her cerulean blue eyes which looked slightly mirror like harry in the other hand looked at hermione with utmost disbelief d do you want cookies harry alice spoke in a stiff voice sniffing harry absentmindedly glanced at alice and mechanically nodded he turned to hermione and looked at her with an expression filled with confusion and shock i ll go on ahead said alice who turned away and left for the dining room leaving harry and hermione alone hermione what she spat what got into you harry asked cautiously i i cantbelieve you actually said that he walked over to her and took her by the shoulders are you sure you re alright hermione looked at his hands and then to harry she couldnthelp but feel a certain jolt of pride that harry cared so much for her feelings she pouted a bit and looked down at the floor i not then what going on harry asked do you do you have a problem with alice a problem with alice hermione brows lifted no she lied i i just have a bad feeling about dontlie to me said harry you bit alice head off awhile ago and now you just did it again i could ve done it to you for all i know hermione suddenly said feeling confusingly angry hermione harry said startled he let go and looked at her quizzically what wrong with you there is nothing wrong with me harry hermione implored nothing then why are you so out of character harry brows furrowed i not out of character hermione retorted defensively calm down wontyou harry said calmly hermione sighed and closed her eyes she pressed her hands to her face and said oh my merlin i sorry harry she said quietly i i just dontknow what came over me hey said harry moving closer to her it alright hermione it alright hermione dropped her hands and saw harry put an arm around her shoulder his cheek pressing onto her temple affectionately hermione leaned back in response and wiped her eyes now let forget about this and have milk and cookies harry said pulling away i think that ll cheer you up hermione smiled and suddenly remembered something actually i remembered that i should do something oh said harry frowning well see you around harry smiled at her weakly and left for dining room yeah you too hermione said quietly hermione silently dragged her feet to the living room and passed across it towards a corridor that led to the bathroom she found herself at the end of the corridor where the entrance to the bathroom was to her left and a double door was located right in front of her it been so long hermione opened the double doors to reveal a closet filled with objects ranging from boxes an old canvas a stack of books a wheel of a bicycle and more hermione rummaged around and found what she was looking for there it is she said she walked backwards pulling out a large bag that was shaped like a violin from the closet hermione took a minute to examine the bag stroking a hand on the curved angle that adorned the side of the bag it been a while a few minutes later hermione found herself inside her bedroom she cast muffliato at her door sat on her bed and eyed on the violin bag one of her unspoken talents that hermione did not share to harry or ron was that she was music literate she wasnttoo entitled to explore her music roots due to her studies but whenever she had the time she would either sing or play the piano her most recent instrument that she started learning was the instrument that was standing before her hermione slowly picked up the bag placed it on her lap and unzipped it she turned the lid over to find a violin lying inside it looked quite old but the wood glistened against the light that the bedroom window radiated it looks all good hermione said smiling down at it under the lid hermione saw a label that said j thropp in gold lettering turning away from the word hermione took out the violin from its resting place blew the residue of dust and propped the instrument on her lap she then reached for the bow and slid a finger on the horsehair that was strung to the wood hermione then pulled out the solid resin from her pocket and rubbed it on the horsehair string circumspectly afterwards she placed the violin the bow and the resin at her side unzipped the front pockets of the violin bag to find a piece of paper filled with musical notes hermione looked at the heading and read the title moon river without hesitation hermione stood up crouched over and looked under her bed she finally saw what she wanted and pulled out a black metal music stand that held musical pieces while the musician plays she unfolded the stand at the floor right beside the foot of her bed placed the musical piece on it and took the violin and bow with her remembering her lessons she peered into the piece placed the violin under chin held the bow against the strings and slowly she played a melodious sound that was soothing to her ears it really been awhile hermione played for a while and began to enjoy it it finally dawned to her how much she loved playing the violin a sudden empty feeling grew inside her while she played she wasntplanning to stop she kept on playing but this feeling inside her it reminded her why she started playing the violin two years ago keep playing hermione hermione played the chorus and kept her face concentrated when is he coming kiwi alice asked her hands placed innocently on her lap while she sat on her chair he ll arrive said hermione pacing around the living room timidly john tends to be late i hope he nice said alice he one of the nicest people i have ever met hermione said whenever i in trouble he always there for me oh said alice looking at her knees i hope he ll like me john will like anyone who nice to him hermione assured just be yourself alice sighed and smiled at her cousin i guess meeting a friend of my favorite cousin wouldnthurt would it it won t said hermione he a bit shy at times so you have to catch up on that oh i will said alice eagerly i just hope he gets here in time dontworry allie said hermione sitting on the couch dontbe too nervous i know said alice i just had a lot of not so good memories of meeting new people hey said hermione in a caring tone john wontcare about it b but what if he won t allie hermione cut her off he will like you no matter what to the point that i ll make him if he doesn t alice giggled you must really want this johnny to meet me dontyou well said hermione pulling a lock of her brown hair behind her ear i always wanted my friends to meet you i mean you re the closest thing i have to a sister and i want my friends to meet my sister alice lip trembled slightly but to hermione relief she didntpress on her emotions so said hermione slowly what do you want to do when johnny comes here anything said alice but no sports please hermione and alice laughed and stopped when they heard the knock of the door oh johnny here hermione squealed you wait here allie hermione ran to the front door and pulled the knob open revealing her pale green eyed friend john who wore brown shorts and a white cotton shirt to match the summer temperature johnny hermione greeted holding the door open for him to enter come in come in hi hermione john said smiling at hermione looking flustered you said you wanted me to come here immediately over the phone yes said hermione excitedly i want you to meet someone m meet someone john cocked up an eyebrow yeah said hermione cheerfully she my cousin i think i remember you saying that your cousin will arrive from the united states john said thoughtfully rubbing his chin as he walked in the threshold that her said hermione now come on she very excited to meet you w wait said john hesitantly h hermione you know me when it comes to meeting new people john scratched the back of his jet black hair hermione frowned at him anxiously please johnny hermione pleaded she very nice and i want you to know her as much as i do she like my sister but what if she finds me goofy she won t hermione said right now she thinking whether you might find her boring really john eyes widened for a second hmmm i never got someone to get nervous over meeting me before hermione made a dry laugh and said well dontpush it so what do you say er out of desperation hermione took john by his right hand with her own two ones and smiled at him tenderly she pouted her lips pleadingly as john face turned to a shade of red oh alright said john in defeat halfheartedly pulling away from hermione grip i ll do it thank you johnny said hermione clapping her hands together just wait a second hermione walked towards the living room where alice was waiting looking both eager and anxious allie i would like you to meet someone very special to me hermione said alice smiled weakly and nodded to her cousin hermione nodded in response and spoke john around the corner that blocked alice view from the front door a boy came in the living room with pale green eyes and jet black hair hermione smiled broadly at john who looked at alice with a look of utmost interest john said hermione gesturing to alice this is alice she my cousin from new york john walked slowly towards alice until he was a meter apart from her since she was sitting down on a chair john looked down at her the two looked at each other timidly h hi alice john said his voice sounding unusually croaky i john to hermione surprise alice blushed furiously as she giggled in her hands which she pressed to her mouth john appeared confused scratching the back of his head nervously he turned to hermione for support and hermione nodded encouragingly go on hermione said quietly john turned to alice who stopped giggling she looked at john and spoke er hi john alice said sheepishly er wow i i didntknow you were er tall hermione smirked at how her two best friends interacted t tall john said quizzically i i didntknow i was tall you look tall to me said alice happily turning pink i in america everyone finds that quite nice hermione widened her eyes at the way alice blushed it was at this moment that hermione knew what was going on the bookworm grinned mischievously at her cousin and at john who was now talking er that good to know er allie said alice instantly you can call me allie hermione wanted to laugh at how alice bit her lip nervously but to her delight john responded before she could do so a allie t that a nice nickname he admitted randomly er i mean i like the name he chuckled nervously and looked at his shoelace hermione then spotted a tinge of pink on his face and it also dawned to her that john is as nervous as alice was t thank you alice said putting her hands together adorably i er know your nickname it johnny right yeah said john erm i did not know hermione cousin looked like her alice and hermione laughed we get that a lot said hermione yeah said alice but i trust you wontget us mixed up i i won t said john instantly trying to sound apologetic i er i didntmean to hurt somebody feelings you re not hurting anyone feelings said alice apologetically i was just saying that because people usually mistake me for kiwi kiwi john asked allie nickname for me said hermione blushing a bit never knew that said john amusingly turning to alice is there anything you know about hermione oh loads said alice looking obviously relieved that they were making conversation hermione laughed nervously and felt quite happy that her best friends were talking let not make your friendship be based on my secrets allie said hermione defensively i sorry kiwi said alice sweetly then looked at john so i wontget you two mixed up i swear said john then added allie it alright if you make a mistake johnny alice replied timidly john chuckled nervously and glanced at hermione who was overlooking them with amusement so er said john it a pleasure meeting you he raised his hand to shake the pleasure is all mine alice said taking john by the hand to shake hermione smiled amusingly at her friends their faces looking quite pink than usual it became extremely obvious to hermione that she got what she wanted even if it more than what she intended her two best friends liked each other a lot this is going to be fun wow hermione hermione stopped bowing and turned her head to see harry looking at her with awe she noted that he was holding a plate of cookies and a glass of milk harry hermione said hoarsely standing up slowly as she placed the violin inside the case hey hey what are you doing harry said quickly putting down the milk and cookies on the dresser why are you putting it away i just dontfeel like to do it anymore hermione replied zipping the bag was it because of me no hermione said glancing at harry apologetically walking up to him no harry it not because of you then why stop playing the moment i entered harry asked grinning at her it could be anyone harry hermione said you seem bothered said harry i not harry did not reply but looked at hermione with a sort of gaze that made hermione feel like he was reading her mind whatever the case may be harry picked up the plate of cookies and turned to hermione again i brought milk and cookies alice said you really love them harry said hermione looked at the cookies and felt her insides bubble again how long were you listening to me play she asked ignoring the cookies er the violin harry placed the cookies down erm long enough he said wincing sorry dontbe said hermione actually you really shouldntsee that i mean i really not that good you were good said harry at least better than the girl who lived next door back at privet drive he scoffed she couldntplay a note even if her life depended on it hermione brushed her hair to the back of her ear then nodded to harry it not that she didntlike him around right now but she wished he went back to alice so what up harry asked sitting on her bed the sky said hermione dully sitting beside harry very funny harry said i serious nothing much said hermione stretching her legs i just excited you dontsound excited harry replied looking at her i mean three days from now we are going to celebrate christmas at my grandfather country home hermione explained feeling quite happier telling this to harry really harry said his eyes widening that sounds great i know said hermione i cantwait to see my grand p re grand p re i call him that as he calls me kiwi harry grinned hermione blushed and hit harry on the shoulder out of nowhere hey harry said rubbing his shoulder that hurt dontcall me that hermione said irritably why not harry stood up and faced her because in my opinion kiwi i told you not to call i think it one of the most amusing things i ever heard from you hermione leered at harry and sighed in defeat there was no stopping him from calling her that now why didntyou tell us about your nicknames anyway harry said kindly sitting beside her again i mean hermonica and kiwi are way better than what grawp gave you at least grawp called me hermy out of his lack of english hermione said lamely to be frank said harry sounding quite hesitant i think your kiwi nickname makes you look look what cute said harry turning to her hermione turned away from his eyes and stared at her lap nothing could tell her on how red she was this was the second time harry has called her adorable or cute what was he playing at since when do you call me cute hermione asked her insecurity getting the best of her i dontknow said harry his voice sounded defensive it just that i am finally seeing who you really were before you became a witch the pictures the nicknames it reminded me that you too had a little girl childhood he turned to hermione i think it adorable that all hermione held her cheeks to hide her blushes never in her life had she heard harry compliment her this much she giggled nervously and spoke oh harry she said in a high voice i m flattered you re funny when you re nervous said harry i not nervous hermione retorted your voice is high enough to give it away kiwi stop calling me that hermione cried turning redder than ever why do they call you that harry asked ignoring hermione last words kiwi how did that came to be hermione paused and stared at harry amused face it looked obvious that he wanted to see her appear this shameful go ahead said harry chuckling take your time you really need to find a hobby harry hermione seethed i break rules said harry apparently it looks like talking about anything kiwi related is against the rules so yeah maybe i doing my hobby quite fine thank you it was unavoidable hermione thought the best way to get rid of this topic is to tell him everything no matter how much she was traumatized by the story you want to know hermione asked roughly yeah said harry hermione inhaled and exhaled they all call me kiwi because she bit her lip and sniffed because i allergic to kiwifruit really yeah i am allergic but that not the end of it she said placing a hand on her cheek i i er there was a time my aunt glinda baked pies for us when she visited and t then she sniffed and rubbed the tip of her eye with her finger then what i loved pies i really do i was so hungry that the minute aunt glinda served my piece i ate it whole hermione bit her lip as her eyes started to feel hot t that s that when i realized that t that that what i ate a kiwi pie she said in a near sob whisper i i nearly died the allergic reaction was too much and i was in the hospital for days hermione felt deeply ashamed that harry had to see her tears fall down she quickly wiped them s sorry said hermione in a throaty voice i i just t thought it was terrible hey said harry scooting over to her you can cry all you want he smiled i mean it your feelings and i think crying over something like a near death experience is okay besides you re my best friend i have to understand why you re like this she sniffed and chuckled hermione smiled at the ground and had the sudden wonder if harry was going to give her a cheer up hug so how did it affect the family aunt glinda was mortified hermione said because it was the first time she saw me ever i was five years old when i met her by the way then she wanted to make a good impression for me so she baked pies for me because my mum who is my aunt sister told her that i loved pies did you hate her for that no hermione cried when i was at the hospital she kept on visiting me and whenever my mum and dad were at work she would stay right by my side the whole time wow she really must love you for that despite how she led you to food poisoning it wasntfood poisoning harry hermione said sternly what matters now is that even with that incident i love my aunt glinda she and aunt elphie are my favorite aunts you know what also matters from that story harry asked moving closer to hermione that they were side by side what she turned to him you re still alive and well he said and put an arm around her in a one arm squeeze harry you really donthave to say that said hermione feeling unusually affronted but pleased at harry concern i have to i mean we would never meet and become best friends he smiled at her mind you you and ron saved my life hermione said ironic eh harry chuckled you nearly died twice the two stayed silent for a long stretch of time hermione twiddled her fingers together and stared at her window which showed the house of her neighbor its structure being framed by a green line of christmas lights against the white snow can you tell me about your aunts harry asked they re all arriving and i think it best for me to know who they are you know just to avoid any awkward moments oh we can do that said hermione erm for the record aunt elphaba or aunt elphie as i call her is my father sister aunt glinda like i said before is my mother sister the names sound awfully familiar said harry everyone says that hermione giggled anyhow the two dontlive here in england they live abroad where new york city said hermione lamely most of my relatives live in america no wonder allie sounds american harry said smirking yeah no wonder hermione agitatedly said anyway i the only one here that seems pretty dull said harry tell me about it hermione turned to harry the only relatives i have here in england are my aunt nessa my father and aunt elphie sister and her husband uncle boq do they have children no hermione said they just married last year but aunt nessa is expecting a baby soon so here hoping how about the children of your other aunts apart from alice that is alice is the daughter of my aunt elphie said hermione ticking off her fingers then we have her brother jericho she said this in an acid tone jericho doesntseem to be in your favor he too much in tune with his stupid stuck up attitude for me to care hermione spat moving on harry said quickly s sorry hermione said remorsefully er after jericho we have twin girls maureen and doreen hermione smiled i love them so much they look up to me as if i were there big sister we call them mimi and didi respectively what the name of their father uncle fierro hermione said he and aunt elphie met during their days at the university anything else you want to tell me about your aunt elphie she loves green said hermione nodding thoughtfully she has always been a green person and for some reason she collects broomsticks are you sure she isnta witch she isn t hermione said dismissively if she was then she would ve been a graduate of a wizarding school as far as i know she studied at a muggle university but she has a collection of hundred brooms i can tell you a hundred brooms harry said in surprise that my aunt elphie said hermione wow she sounds wicked i know hermione giggled she quite enjoyed that she was sharing everything about her family to harry it was both a relief that she can share it to harry without worrying about anything at all how about your other aunt aunt glinda she my mother best friend said an adorably high voice from the door hermione and harry looked up and saw alice standing by the threshold of the bedroom door hermione quickly glared at her cousin as alice entered i was wondering where you two went said alice and turned to hermione i see your taking time into playing the violin cousin dearest i getting good you know said hermione coolly i ve heard a lot about that from aunt monmon said alice did you try bowing right this time of course hermione said in a steely tone i think i recall aunt glinda telling me that many times looks like after four years you re still the brainy cousin i have always known alice said smiling at hermione and then to harry hermione followed alice gaze and saw harry smiling at her weakly she felt somehow affronted at how harry appeared nervous hi alice said in the gentlest voice she could ever muster h hi said harry i er did what you asked me t to do aww you did alice said sweetly tilting her head adorably what do you mean hermione looked from harry to alice puzzlingly but neither of the two caught her words since they continued talking as if hermione said nothing yeah said harry standing up i erm thought it would be good if i did it earlier hermione raised an eyebrow at the two and glared at harry at the way he was rubbing the back of his neck anxiously you shouldnthave said alice turning slightly pink well t that way harry said slowly i took care of one thing so you can have one less thing to worry about wow alice said glancing at hermione with amusement you re too sweet harry alice reached out and held harry by the arm which triggered harry to chuckle nervously for all the reason in her heart hermione wanted to lunge at alice and pull her hair out of her skull until alice high voice screams in throes of pain her pretty face glistened in tears the thought of that was just so sadistic um excuse me said hermione standing up to full height sorry for interrupting but harry and i were talking thank you i aware alice said icily her cerulean blue eyes boring into hermione chocolate brown ones so i was wondering if i can talk to harry for a moment no said hermione instantly er hermione harry stared at her cautiously sorry you heard me alice said hermione irritably i talking to harry first and i wish we could finish our conversation before you get into it hermione alice said it only going to be a short talk make me laugh hermione muttered and i promise you it wonttake too long alice finished staring at hermione coldly if you take more than one minute hermione said but was cut off by harry i i ll go said harry quickly w what hermione gawked at harry her face feeling rather hot i ll go with allie said harry i mean she has something to talk about right i do said alice happily in fact it wonttake too long cousin dearest so dontcry over spilled milk alright hermione held her all to stop herself from punching alice in the face i won t hermione seethed i ll be at the living room harry said alice walking out of the door leaving harry and hermione alone once more she wasnthesitant hermione immediately walked away from harry and crossed her arms angrily as she stared outside the snow flecked window the nerve of him he chose that that scarlet woman over me hermione shook her head and sighed in defeat er hermione harry asked his voice sounded unusually cautious what hermione said her voice sounded booming and it had a tinge of anger in it hey look at me please harry said hermione obeyed and turned to her best friend what is it hermione said i er canthelp but notice that you and allie are not erm close hermione blinked and did not answer harry she turned away and bit her lip broodingly for years she tried to avoid discussing her hate for alice to anyone who asked but with harry asking should she tell remember the last time you kept a secret from a best friend an emotional pain struck her gut at that thought it somehow made her alarmed should she tell him hermione harry appeared at her side are you alright hermione did not reply again but continued to look out the window is there something you want to tell me about alice hermione looked at harry and sighed there nothing wrong harry alice and i are just two rival cousins who still she bit her lip regretfully love each other but ron told me about your hate for dudley and you never discuss that with me hermione said in a matter of factly tone hey why are you so angry harry asked in aghast i not angry harry hermione said though her voice sounded fuming so why dontyou just drop whatever i feeling for alice and go out there and see if she has something that might interest you hermione harry said making hermione stop what got into you it nothing hermione said her voice in a high tone i j just tired yeah i tired a silence followed between the two hermione winced at how she reacted it wasntbest to do that especially when harry looked doubtful at the moment great job kiwi harry doubtful look turned to a shaking of the head from him hermione watched him as he shook his head impatiently and to her surprise he turned and walked towards the door harry hermione said harry stopped on his tracks and looked at her i i sorry she said biting her lip i i didntmean to be so harsh i know said harry wryly i not mad or anything but i have to note that you shouldntkeep that attitude up if you want a happy christmas enjoy your cookies and with that harry left the room without a word hermione slowly raked her brown hair and grimaced at harry reaction it happening again it like four years ago oh harry hermione moaned pitifully thinking that it was the best hermione walked over to her dresser and took a cookie from the plate she bit off the edge of the chocolate chip treat and drank her glass of milk it been four years since she lost her whole life in the muggle world everything that meant something to her at first she had the wizarding world where harry and ron existed as her best friends and the muggle world where her life was equally the same but now it just harry and ron at this rate she promised herself that she wouldntreiterate whatever happened to her muggle life with her best friends from hogwarts but it happening again with harry hermione gulped and reminded herself that harry will never leave her no matter what he a good hearted soul that hermione thought it would be impossible for him to act anything harsh keep it real hermione harry will always love you would he always were the words that came from hermione lips she immediately gasped and took an intake of breath oh god hermione said holding her forehead i i didntmean that i did not mean that hermione dropped the cookie on the plate sat on her bed and looked at the violin nothing will happen again just think that and you ll be fine the christmas air slid across the window as hermione brooded on maybe she was right maybe she just too clung to the past that she thinking too much about a possible jeopardized act towards her friendship with harry and with that comfortable thought hermione stood from her bed and ate the rest of the cookies hermione and harry spent the rest of the afternoon unpacking it wasnta very talky session since hermione knew that harry was a bit annoyed at her after their last talk the two unpacked in silence in hermione bedroom while hedwig finally free from her cage perched herself on the surface of hermione dresser hermione dragged her trunk on the foot of her bed like how she placed it back at the hogwarts dormitories it was strangely bothersome for her to think that she and harry were not talking at the moment silence between the two happened before but this time was different hermione transfixed on the idea why it felt so and realized that she was just running around the dark of her thoughts harry on the other hand unpacked most of his stuff and transferred them in the guest bedroom they finally decided on where harry will sleep since the guest bedroom was bigger and had more beds than hermione bedroom it was all good except for one detail that didntbode well for hermione alice was sleeping there too this is going to be so much fun hermione heard alice voice from the room across the hall as she closed her trunk she lifted her head in time to see harry carry a bunch of his clothes into the guestroom door which faced hermione room giving her a partial view of the guestroom you can sleep on the bed over there said alice hermione saw her point at the unseen bed while i sleep over here she plopped herself on the bed nearest to her hermione rolled her eyes and picked up her bundle of wizards robes and placed them on the shelf you know harry alice voice said you know harry hermione mimicked in a mockingly high squeaky voice we should play i never alice continued obviously oblivious to hermione insult i never harry voice asked hermione peeked out of her door and saw through the hall and the open door of the guestroom harry sitting on the bed with alice conversing with her here said alice taking a plate of cookies on her end table the object of the game is to get to know the other person i will admit that i never did this or that and if you have done it what i claimed that i never did you eat a cookie got it er harry said scratching the back of his head for example said alice i never wore men underwear harry stared at her confusingly that means you can eat a cookie harry said alice pleasantly because you wear men underwear hermione scoffed turned away and stared into the reflection of her mirror when she heard harry reply oh harry nodded i think i get it now he picked up a cookie and bit its side see it easy alice said your turn hermione brows furrowed as harry said i never had long shoulder length hair inadvertently hermione touched the tip of her brown hair and noticed it was shoulder length as alice s that a good start alice said taking a bite of her cookie okay i never suffered from any visual acuity except for twenty twenty there was a long silence then a sound of cookies being bitten you got me said harry it wasnttoo hard to tell said alice beautifully but i have to admit my vision been a bit sucky so i use these hermione knew what alice was talking about even without looking around the corner to look at alice taking out her reading glasses you have nice glasses said harry voice thank you said alice a lot of people say that i look weird in them er harry said nervously i er dontthink you look bad i mean you look nice to me hermione reflection bit its lip painfully wow not even my friends back at college admits that thanks er no problem harry said chuckling you re very sweet you know that the anger in her mind couldntcontrol herself hermione immediately left her room and marched off down the hallway and went across the hall she stood by the threshold of the guestroom where alice and harry were a plate of cookies sitting between them on the bed and said shouldntyou two be unpacking hermione said bossily we re done said alice gesturing to the side of her bed harry helped here with my luggage so i was able to finish earlier and since he was such a nice boy she patted his knee i helped him with his luggage harry smiled gingerly at alice and looked at his fumbling fingers hermione felt somehow hurt that he didntbother to look at her i see then hermione said stiffly well i ll be off hermione spun around and walked down the hallway and stopped on her tracks she bit her knuckles worriedly and felt the hurt grow he is not like him what was that all about said the voice of alice the bookworm quickly took a step back and leaned against the wall adjacent to the open door of the guestroom which one that you didntseem to um notice my cousin erm hermione and i just had a little argument that all hermione sighed sadly and felt relieved that harry admitted it she was about to walk away but the temptation of listening in more grew when alice replied a quick footnote harry said alice intelligently you shouldntsever ties to your best friends what was this was alice speaking on hermione behalf because hermione probably wouldntlast long without one it was too good to be true i know said harry look i really dontwant to talk about it whatever floats your boat said alice happily anyway er where were we oh yeah my turn um i never play on a broomstick what harry said in a surprise tone hermione slapped a hand on her face and remembered that she didnttell harry this one tiny detail about her cousin broomstick said alice vaguely you know flying b but you didntknow i have knowledge about my cousin witchcraft alice said teasingly well obviously she told me and once i saw you i had a hunch you were her classmate in hogwarts hermione never said anything like that harry said lamely it not her duty to do so said alice so you know about quidditch hermione sent me a book about it a year after her first year there she told me loads wow i i did not expect that you would know i full of surprises said alice besides i surprise you know a lot about er what do you call that non magic people muggle said harry yeah that one i was surprised that you knew about muggle stuff well i full of surprises said harry sarcastically oh now you re using my own words against me alice replied jokingly yeah i was harry said courageously ha ha alice chuckled you re too much you know that the sound of a mouth biting to cookies drummed hermione ears fair enough anyway my turn said harry jokily i never went to disneyland thrice said alice biting her cookie i just love it there okay here one hermione looked on her shoulder and realized the unusual silence of her cousin as if alice was thinking through her next words i never she said thoughtfully moved on wheels her brows furrowed confusingly and heard harry mouth chomping down a cookie my cousin gave me a set of rubbish rollerblades years ago said harry you know he thought it would be a good laugh anyway i moved around with them until they finally broke donttell me you haventused roller skates you seem to be the type to tell you the truth i never did anything like that until i turned fifteen alice said darkly really harry asked the pace of hermione heart increased she never knew alice would bring this up again not now not ever yeah but it like complications of er providing myself a set she laughed oh hermione heard enough she left the two to their business and found herself in the second floor bathroom sitting on the closed lid of the toilet thinking of old memories as much as she hated it as much as her hatred for alice bubbled inside her she canthelp but miss everything about alice after what she said a couple of minutes ago kiwi alice said as she approached hermione in the living room allie hermione gasped i thought you were in the front yard with john i was said alice smiling he went home now i tired said hermione leaning her head against the couch backrest i never knew you liked strolling around the neighborhood alice blushed w well i i she placed her hands on her lap i really don t why john liked to walk around said alice quietly hermione observed her cousin timid behavior with interest the way alice stared at her fumbling fingers dreamily and how she glanced out the window with a sense of wanting for the past few hours hermione john and alice walked around the neighborhood to get some fresh air as john calls it john suggested this and hermione who was obviously protective of her delicate cousin alice decided against it but alice immediately agreed it turned out to be an enjoyable walk with alice and john talking the whole time while hermione smirked from behind it been days how do you like johnny so far hermione asked casually i d donthave a crush on him said alice defensively since when did i say anything about a crush allie hermione asked her eyebrow rising amusingly i never said anything like that alice turned to a deep shade of red and placed her hands on her cheeks i i didntmean that oh no alice moaned shamefully hermione smiled and moved closer to alice is there something you want to tell me allie hermione asked slowly enjoying every minute of her cousin timid behavior alice giggled nervously and shook her head vigorously n nothing kiwi alice said calmly nothing i think someone likes johnny i don t alice squeaked her trademark high voice getting squeakier than usual w well i mean i i hermione flashed a skeptical look at alice which silenced her alright said alice in defeat i admit it she blushed furiously i i think i like johnny oooooh hermione squealed bouncing on the couch i knew it ever since the first time you met dontpush it kiwi alice cried blushing further y you know how emotional i get but this is huge allie hermione smiled you have a crush on my best friend kiwi alice squeaked turning redder as they went stop that awwww is allie getting embarrassed alice pouted and looked sulky hermione knew well that alice was very sensitive and at times she enjoyed it when alice looked helpless it was too adorable you re mean alice said sulkily her adorably gentle voice becoming profound oh allie i didntmean it said hermione walking over to hug her cousin i just happy that all i know alice said softly do you think he likes me i think he does said hermione sitting back on the couch he couldntkeep his eyes off you really alice said her eyes beaming at hermione i think so said hermione in a tone of definiteness smirking well who cantlike you you re very pretty alice didntreply but nodded shyly not that pretty alice said you are allie said hermione everyone in the family thinks you re the prettiest granger i not alice said you are pretty too hermione scoffed who me the girl with big front teeth i doubt it but people say we look alike said alice and if you say i pretty then i can say you are hermione giggled whatever floats your boat allie ding dong i ll get it said hermione walking to the front door hermione reached the door opened it and was surprised there was no one there hello hermione peered out of the door seeing nothing but the afternoon sunlight that blanketed the road in an orange slab of light strange no one here oh below her sat three letters letters that looked awfully familiar oh my it dawned to her that the three letters were labeled with the same candle wax seal from the other similar letter the big h being surrounded by four animals it the letter again using her quick mind of deduction hermione presumed that the sender sent more letters assuring that hermione would get them are they expecting a reply from me how could that be an option she hasnteven opened her first letter and here she is looking down at resends now what kiwi is everything okay i fine hermione called out to alice her eyes on the letters what are you waiting for pick them up hesitantly the bookworm bent lower and picked up the three letters she surveyed it and was surprised that her bedroom was still the address the letter was sent to what kind of person would send such letters should she open them she was planning to open the first letter but due to her time with alice the letter seems to be nothing but a distant memory that not worth noting going through the letters again hermione saw that it was written in the same emerald green ink with the same handwriting as before it looked as if it was an exact copy of the last letter there were no mere differences on every letter to the very last edge not a single fiber looked different on the fore kiwi alice voice called again this time it sounded worried hermione returned to her cousin with the letters clasped between her fingers who was it alice asked innocently no one said hermione b but i found these she showed alice the letters alice craned her neck from her seat and surveyed them they have your name on it i know but the thing is i got another one like this a week ago hermione explained sitting on the couch you did yes well i think the sender is resending the letter to make sure i ll get it why would the sender resend it alice asked er i did not open the first letter i received hermione winced so i guess they re really making sure i get it this time she shook the two extra letters to alice why wontyou open it surely there isntanything there that will harm you right this was true alice has always been a smart girl hermione thought alice and hermione were known to be very smart for their age but for one who wants to know alice intelligence leans more of observation and keen sense while hermione intelligence came from facts and figures of books i just have a bad feeling about this letter that all hermione said looking at the letter bad feeling yeah bad feeling hermione said turning the letters around well because ever since should she tell alice about the abnormalities that had happened for the past few years hermione trusted alice so much that it could suffice a comprehension from her she might think i mad ever since what alice asked her voice gentle and serene hermione hesitated she looked at the letter and glanced to alice will this be worth her time could be a allie hermione said quietly are you alright kiwi alice asked worriedly i fine said hermione smiling at her i was just wondering if you can er if you can keep a secret of course said alice eagerly anything for you alright but hermione craned her neck forward to see the dining room where her mother was writing down papers that were related to dental finances let talk in my room we need some privacy it took them a long while to get up to hermione bedroom but at long last they finally made it hermione closed shut the door after alice rolled in alice turned to her and gave a look of questioning well she asked in her gentle voice it s hermione winced realizing how difficult this will be please dontthink i crazy allie i won t said alice innocently after a sigh hermione started w well you know these letters well erm dontbe shy kiwi said alice smiling confidently at her you can tell me anything hermione smiled back and knew that if there is anyone who can understand her it was alice okay said hermione walking across the room sitting on the surface of her dresser erm let say er years ago i i made snuggles fly hermione didntknow why she said it but telling her cousin that she levitated her teddy bear in this fashion sounded stupid i meant that i made snuggles levitate hermione said quickly alice blinked at hermione rather cutely hermione knew she was confused levitate to bring up in the air said hermione wincing i dontget it said alice hermione sighed what i trying to say allie is that i think i doing things what things things that er she stood up and paced around the room happen that i canteven explain because they re beyond reason but what is it kiwi alice asked anxiously hermione looked at her cousin worriedly should she tell her now or back out please tell me alice said pleadingly if it bothering you then i here to help you isntthat what sisters do alice words struck hermione emotionally never in her life did she want to hug alice and wish that she was her sister what do you say alice smiled hermione cleared her throat walked towards alice and gazed upon her cerulean blue eyes you really want to know hermione asked yes d don t think different of me when i done okay hermione said crouching before her sitting cousin i won t said alice holding her cousin hand i ll never think you any different i promise and that you wontdistant yourself from me why would i do that kiwi alice said beaming at her kindly no matter what happens you ll be with me like a handprint on my heart and with those words hermione knew nothing could go wrong something was wrong as the afternoon turned into dusk and then dusk into night despite how the granger household was alive with the christmas spirit christmas music playing from the stereo christmas lights twinkling around the interior and exterior the snow falling friendlily outside hermione realized how grim she felt it was during dinner that hermione felt empty she probably knew why and it was because how harry didntspeak to her except when he asked her for the mashed potatoes alice in the other hand was talking to hermione parents expressing how she enjoying so far and that she excited for visiting the country home this unusual feeling deepened when alice playfully talked to harry c mon harry said alice nudging his shoulder with hers tell aunt monmon and uncle jac jac tell us what dear monica asked scooping up a generous amount of mashed potatoes er harry said his voice sheepish allie and i were er snogging jacques asked in a booming voice that sounded both stern and intimidating hermione eyes widened like dinner plates as alice and harry blushed dad hermione cried what jacques asked his eyebrows rising i just being precautious to my niece b but that uncalled for hermione said her voice high and squeaky it both a father and uncle job said jacques humorously but seriously what did you two do he turned to harry harry his redness ebbing away cleared his throat and said er alice and i were erm cleaning the guestroom you did monica asked beaming looks like you saved me from cleaning that place harry here thought it was a good idea said alice pensively grinning at harry very sweet of you said monica turning to hermione you pick good friends hermione hermione smiled weakly at her mother and caught harry eye for a split second she thought he grinned at her but on a double take harry was back to his lamb chops well then said jacques i quite impressed harry you give that vibe of energy like my sister aunt elphaba harry asked politely yes said jacques looks like hermonica hermione hermione muttered under her breath has been telling you about the family harry nodded slowly breaking into a smile hermione looked at harry sadly and sighed she took a gulp of her water and finished what was left of her green peas so what have you three been up to asked monica harry and i were cleaning up the whole guestroom and just bonding to get to know each other said alice enthusiastically then her voice went back to a normal tone we really didntknow what hermione was up to you didntjoin the cleaning monica asked turning to hermione no i didn t hermione said giving a quick glance at alice with annoyance i was busy preparing for grand p re speaking of which said jacques glancing to alice and harry i suggest you two go pack for the country home i know you have all day tomorrow but the earlier the better dontworry uncle said alice sweetly harry and i will get busy tonight w what harry asked flushing i meant packing silly alice said leaning on his shoulder briefly you re too cute hermione stomach lurched when alice pinched the cheek of her best friend she wanted to grab her fork and toss it between alice eyes hey you can do the pinching when i not around said jacques jokingly as he chuckled kids these days really you said you werentafraid to put your arm around mum when her parents were around hermione said quietly that because your mother he placed a hand on monica s is my holy grail awww monica smiled dearly at jacques hermione rolled her eyes and turned to alice again observing how she smiled at monica and jacques anyway just take care of my two girls for me would you kindly harry jacques asked happily harry nodded obviously feeling pleased that he was worth of jacques trust hermione didntknow whether she should feel good about this or not this is so confusing wow looks like i ll have a knight in shining armor this year said alice amusingly harry smiled at alice who smiled back i would love that said harry confidently it was at this time hermione wanted to toss the fork through harry glasses and into his skull any plans for tomorrow alice asked instantly tearing her eyes away from harry i have to arrange with eddie about borrowing his van said jacques we will need an extra vehicle to transport everyone to the country home i settling some accounts said monica i cantimagine living the holidays with them breathing down my neck that good said alice interestedly how about you harry erm i really dontknow ooh we can build a snowman together alice said excitedly oh i almost forgot said monica speaking of snow i propose you three help in preparing the house before glinda and elphaba arrive oh bummer said alice cutely looks like we can do it next time harry even if hermione didntsee it she knew alice reached for harry hand to hold since harry turned red feeling possessive over her best friend hermione clutched her fork so tightly that she found it almost impossible to not toss it right at alice head are you alright hermione monica asked you look fidgety hermione is fine said alice smartly she just got off playing her violin the wondering face that was etched on her mother face turned into a look of pity hermione knew why and did nothing but smile sadly at her then turned to alice with a look of pure annoyance violin eh jacques asked still got the bowing right yes dad said hermione calmly looked at her unfinished food shook her head and said may i be excused but you haventfinished please hermione said pleadingly looking at her mother with a looking of wanting i not really hungry anymore hermione glanced to alice and harry who were busy enjoying themselves with talking feeling her irate rising she nodded to her mother without hearing another word picked up her plate and left for the kitchen she placed her plate on the sink and stared down at it with concentration listening to alice talking she ll be fine aunt said alice you know she ll go through anything hermione gripped the sides of the sink and glared at the dripping drop that fell to the sink metal surface she couldntunderstand why she was so angry at the moment the way harry was there enjoying alice company the way alice looked triumphant being with him it was so so annoying that that heathen why was she feeling this it was enough that she felt bad that harry wonttalk to her right now but to feel this possessive over harry i have no right to tell who gets to be friends with harry hermione you don t she raked her brown hair tiredly and closed her eyes she heard the giggling of alice and the voice of harry which seemed inaudible at the moment to her distracted ears you have to talk to harry apologize to him for snapping at him like that if she continued to not talk to him she might not enjoy this holiday at all but i dontwant him to be with alice does it matter hermione knew well that she cantstop that no matter how gut wrenching it was you really got off to a good start she heard her father speak of course uncle jac jac said alice from the outside of the kitchen harry is nicest guy i ever met i wish we knew each other long before no he mine i met him first and you have no right to take him away from me you witch you wicked witch you slu no hermione gasped jumping backwards causing her to collide with the kitchen counter behind her which hung knives her head bumped into the small knife making it fall off its hinge and thrust right onto her backhand ah hermione winced in pain as the knife fell on the counter surface in a clang ow ow ow ow she squeaked her eyes welling up hermione called the voice of her mother are you alright the wound wasntdeep but that didntstop her backhand from spewing blood she quickly washed her hands the cold winter water stinging her hands oh bugger hermione grimaced soaping her hand what going on said monica entering through the batwing doors of the kitchen hermione hermione turned to see her mother approach to her daughter what happened i was cut said hermione stiffly washing her hands oh dear said monica taking hermione hands observing it it not deep which knife the cheese knife hermione said dully wincing as her mother touched her wound well nothing that band aid cantfix monica smiled at her but frowned to see hermione grim expression what wrong hermonica for the first time in a while hermione did not protest at her nickname she lowered her head and shook it nothing mum hermione said quietly slowly pulling her hand away from her mother grasp i just tired that all you ve been playing his violin have you monica asked kindly hermione bit her lip she knew she would ask this yes said hermione sadly rubbing her hand which throbbed slightly but only once just this afternoon oh hermione said monica taking hermione by her cheeks i figured after i said harry reminded me of him i felt that i hit an emotional spot i sorry hermione pouted her lips and held back the tears that were welling up now she didntwant to cry not now it okay mum said hermione her voice croaky i i just miss him that all he loved that violin said monica lowering her hands it touching how you re taking care of it for him he gave it to me said hermione sniffing i promised him that if i felt like it i would at least learn to play it before before she nearly choked some air and felt like she wanted to run to her mother and sob she held it all with all the strength she could muster is there anything you want to tell me hermione shook her head again and forced a sad smile i ll be alright mum said hermione i just feel so tired well you better get some rest soon because you ll all be busy fixing the house for the arrival of your aunts and i hear my sister is baking pie again for you ugh hermione held her stomach dontremind me well it not kiwifruit this time said monica i know said hermione trying to push the painful memories away er i think i should be going up for that bandage now oh yes yes of course monica nodded just be careful or you might slip in the bathroom remember two years ago yes mum said hermione pointedly walking out of the batwing doors ignoring everyone in the dining room except her father who spoke are you alright hermonica i thought i heard a clatter i fine said hermione smiling i accidentally cut myself that all she showed her backhand which had her fingers were pressed on i just going to get it patched up you know in america people who cut themselves are considered unorthodox said alice instantly hermione blinked oh i bet they do alice hermione said snapping a look at alice catching harry eyes i mean mind you miraculous happenings can be considered unorthodox correct with a quick kiss on her father cheek hermione bade them goodnight and clambered up the stairs and into her room where she flung herself on the bed trust alice to say such rubbish unorthodox as if she wasntan unorthodox girl who rolled about that wasntvery nice to say hermione thought again shrugging off every emotion in her mind hermione found herself in the bathroom applying a bandage on her cut she massaged it and looked into her reflection to see her haggard face you look terrible hermione said pulling down her lower eyelid to reveal the red veins among the white on her eyeball she went back to her dark room sans for the night light that gave a whitish glow at the corner of her room and sat on her bed sleepily it was long minutes until she heard the voices of harry and alice ascending up the stairs she groaned as alice voice resonated through the walls of her bedroom you have to see new york city it so beautiful especially at night i know you ll love it maybe we can fly there on my broomstick said harry voice that ll be nice said alice kindly it ll be like aladdin except we re flying on a broomstick nice indeed said harry unusually hermione felt left out that she wasntout there talking with harry like that and for some reason she wished he offered her to fly with him on his broomstick hey harry alice voice said its volume loud enough to tell that she and harry were outside of the guestroom door have you ever used the internet a dull silence er no said harry his voice sounded excited of course harry has never used the internet at all oh well looks like i going to introduce you to the wonderful world of the world wide web i was supposed to do that hermione shook her head vigorously and groaned ever since harry accepted her offer to go with her on this trip she wanted to show him how using a computer was like after hearing stories from ron that the dursleys wouldntlet him use one and now alice beat me to it not that it was a big deal but there were lots of things she wanted to show harry if only if he could talk to me just apologize to him she thought it was the only way hermione left her bed walked up to the door and pressed her ear against it the voices were softer giving her evidence that they were inside the guestroom she opened her door gradually and saw the empty hallway but the guestroom door open and that what you call a mouse pointer she heard alice voice from inside what is this one for harry asked hermione edged closer and leaned to take a peek at harry watching alice use the computer luckily their backs were to her so they werentaware that hermione was watching them what this harry pointed to the screen where a white window popped up it a program like a thingy mabobber that makes you send mail like owls yeah definitely like owls alice said ruffling his hair you learn fast harry smirked with pride hermione gripped the doorframe and listened more so this mail thing harry said leaning on his knees e mail said alice yeah e mail how does it work you type in the address here she pointed to the screen then you write down the subject of the letter you re sending you have a choice to attach a picture or a file with the letter oh said harry who are you writing to to my dearest darling est momsy and popsicle said alice in the most adorable voice harry grinned broadly and looked at alice with a sense of admiration hermione rolled her eyes not wanting to watch them any further hermione left for her room and fell on her bed realizing how much harry meant to her you re not going to lose him hermione the only way was to go back into that room and tell him straight out that she was sorry for getting angry at him awhile ago she took off her shoes lay down on her bed rolled on her side and looked at the snow flecked window but what if he doesntwant an apology she asked herself quietly impossible harry is too articulate to not accept an apology oh hermione gripped her sheets tightly biting her lip as the cold of the winter night shuddered her to sleep dear miss granger we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry term starts september 1 the hogwarts express leaves from platform nine and three quarters on august 30 from king cross station enclosed is a list of the books and supplies you will need we await your answer by owl sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress hermione reread the letter was this legit well alice asked looking over hermione shoulder anything else hermione looked at the other letter and saw that this one addressed her parents another letter was the aforementioned list of books and supplies n nothing said hermione her voice was dry hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry alice mouthed looking at the heading of the letter you dontthink its fake do you i i not sure hermione said croakily looking over the letter b but i dontknow calm down kiwi alice said placing a comforting hand on hermione shoulder it might mean something mean what allie hermione turned to her i i dontsee how this means anything it means that this is the answer to why you re doing these weird things alice implored look it says it is a school of witchcraft so maybe you are a i not a witch allie said hermione sternly because that way i a freak you know what they do to witches back in the middle ages but that was so long ago said alice what if it a prank hermione snapped what if it just some stupid prank to set me up and look like an idiot by who alice asked by two people i dontwant you to meet allie hermione said hysterically who are they hermione silenced she wasntin the mood to tell her favorite cousin about the two people who bully her it nothing allie hermione said i j just confused and lost about this dontbe said alice i here remember my job is to keep you right in the head alice smiled confidently at hermione you re right hermione said breathing slowly i should pull myself together that good said alice you re one of the people i know who can go through anything thank you hermione said placing a shoulder on alice but i couldntdo any of that without you but we see each other only once every two or three years kiwi alice said i dontunderstand i limited said hermione simply frowning without you i feel that way you re my best friend in the whole world alice giggled well i know i who i am today because i knew you alice said like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes the sun hermione replied chuckling as she leaned and hugged alice but i really dontknow what to do with this letter it says the sender awaits your reply by owl alice looked at the letter pulling away from hermione what does it mean i not so sure hermione squinted at the letter but it obviously means that i should reply to them if i ll enroll to this school you actually think there is a school of witchcraft kiwi alice stared at her i not so sure hermione moaned i cant i really have no idea well lets say there is a school of magic and that will probably answer why i burn cabinets or let objects fly alice pointed out or turn soda into ice hermione nodded but i dontget why you re being too skeptic alice said i know you re bright and you re using your observations if this is a joke or not but after all you have told me the magic and what not who knows hermione stared at the letter and sighed there so much to think about allie hermione said picking up the letter but i really find it important that i dontlet this bother me all summer i mean you re here johnny is there i think it right to just let this go kiwi allie it probably a joke hermione said i mean answer by owl who does that i ve heard about mailing things with pigeons alice said innocently maybe that what it meant but and didntyou say that owls were following around you for the past few years and that one of them gave you a feeling that it understood you it was a she said hermione but does it mean anything hermione those owls could be flying around waiting for your reply letter for all we know they probably knew you are a witch it just too complicated allie hermione said it impossible beyond what books can explain you know that you re as bright as i am this was true another reason why alice and hermione got a long so well was because the two were studious but kiwi alice pleaded i am not as bright as you but i have a gut feeling that this will help you a lot it could answer your questions but what if it a joke hermione said what if it isn t alice countered a pause followed as the two looked at each other eyes is alice right about her judgment show the letter to uncle jac jac and aunt monmon alice said i sure they ll know what to do no hermione said i ll probably do so but not now not when they have the clinic to be worried about alice didntreply but eyed her cousin worriedly i ll be fine allie hermione smiled dontbe too worried about me let just enjoy the summer while it lasts okay alice bowed her head disappointingly i want to help you kiwi hey hermione crouched lower to meet alice eyes you are helping me allie you re keeping me happy by being here and that a lot of help on your part are you sure you re going to be alright i will be hermione said but if anything happens on the way you ll be there to pull me out of it right of course alice smiled as long as johnny is there the two girls giggled in delight while hermione felt better than she did for the past hour what they didntknow was the fluttering trio of owls that perched themselves on a tree branch just right outside of the bedroom window hermione shuddered while she lay on her side in bed it so cold she wondered how she slept without her blanket on where my blanket with her eyes shut close she reached out the darkness for her blanket and felt nothing but the cold smooth surface of her bedsheets oh god it cold mmmm she moaned in complaint c cold then just before she could get any colder she felt herself being blanketed by something fluffy and warm her body that shivered stopped abruptly as the comfort of the warmth under the blanket overcame her she clutched the hem of the blanket tightly and curled up to keep herself warmer warmth at last a hand stroked the back of her brown hair then traveled to her shoulder she felt the side of her bed giving into weight sinking a bit the stroking of her shoulder was nice hermione liked it as she groggily took the stroking hand from her shoulder and pulled it towards her wait a minute as reality kicked back to her mind her eyes flung open and gasped at the hand she held she pushed it away sat up and looked around the darkness who there she said in panic clutching the blanket hermione said a familiar voice calm down it only me that voice h harry no it ron hermione eyes widened r ron no it harry said harry sarcastically you actually think ron could come here as her eyes adjusted to the darkness she saw harry figure materialize in front of her he sat on the side of her bed his glasses reflecting the dim night light behind her oh hermione blushed i i thought you were someone she became quiet her knees curled up to her breast hermione gradually wrapped herself inside the blanket trying to feel warm as possible until she became aware on who gave her the blanket harry didntlook happy he looked like someone who haventeaten his grim expression boring onto hermione made her feel uneasy what are you doing here hermione said before she could stop herself i came here to check on you said harry instantly then drew circles on the bed i thought you werentokay well i fine harry hermione said her annoyed emotions getting the best of her i really dontneed you werentfine when i saw you shivering harry cut her off i thought it was best to keep you warm his voice sounded almost livid that made hermione shrink down in her place i sorry she said quietly i i should ve been grateful harry became silent and scooted closer to her are you alright now obviously i am you re here with me hermione nodded how your hand hermione took out her hand and showed him the bandaged backhand a red spot where the cut was could be seen among the brown plaster harry took her hand gently and rubs it slowly it looks red said harry it in pain that why hermione said rolling her eyes so that means you re not okay harry said i fine harry harry looked at her skeptically fine said hermione sternly i am not and why is that the green eyes that shone in the darkness were too much for hermione she grimaced bit her lip and blurted out because you werenttalking to me all day she blushed furiously realizing how weird the words were when said harry warmly smiled the smile that kept her safe and secure whenever he did so feeling embarrassed hermione curled up under her blanket and didntmeet his eyes she wished he could stop looking at her that way we re talking now said harry so i ask you again are you alright hermione buried her mouth to the sheets that were draped on her knees she didntmeet his eyes and caught them briefly before looking back at the ground again how alice she asked she fine said harry alice is like a mischievous version of you to be honest hermione flushed dontsay that she pleaded i telling you said harry she smart she loves reading books and she knows about the wizarding world it was like having another hermione then why dontyou go and talk to her instead of me hermione blurted out angrily obviously i lack being mischievous and pretty hey harry raised his hand in defense dontbite my head off and since when did i say anything about pretty you stare at her a lot hermione seethed well harry scratched the back of his head i cantlie she is very pretty oh god hermione muttered but that doesntexplain why you re so angry harry said look i came here for one reason only what to rub the fact that i am not enjoying my first day of the holidays hermione asked feeling extremely hurt that she thought of this harry jaw dropped slightly no he shook his head i came here because i missed you a double take what i missed you harry said smiling we haventspoken to each other in nine hours harry twelve harry said pointing to his watch it nearly two in the morning nonetheless hermione said i dontsee how you can miss me when we haventsaid a thing to each other in a short span of time nonetheless said harry regardless of the short span of time i can miss you but why you re my best friend said harry it was strange to not talk to you while we passed each other today you really did miss me hermione said lowering her knees yeah said harry and i felt bad that you werenthaving such a good day while i had a good one i mean i should ve gone up earlier and see if you re alright i should be the one harry hermione said i should have not been such a git hours ago it alright said harry i know how you can be at times she became aware that harry was tugging the bandage of her hand slowly what are you doing i want to see the wound don t hermione tried pulling her hand from harry just let me see it harry pulled it back i wonthurt you i swear hermione bit her lip do you trust me what do you trust me harry repeated hermione looked into his eyes and sighed yes then in a gradual moment harry pulled out her bandage her hand stinging in feeble pain it not too deep said harry looking at the wound it was a cheese knife hermione said that good i cantimagine hermione hand cut off for the first time in a long while hermione let out a genuine giggle she smiled at harry and felt glad he was here with her in her bedroom instead of the guestroom where alice was sleeping soundly in her bed unknown that harry was here with her imagine the look on her face when she finds out then a sudden thought came to her mind it materialized as she viewed harry gazing down at her wounded hand h harry she asked tentatively yeah he looked at her erm you know about my wound what about it well she blushed w when i was young she glanced at harry and back to the her knees whenever i got a wound m my mum and dad would kiss it hermione froze what are you thinking hermione are you actually hoping that harry will kiss your booboo y yes she said not meeting his eyes b but i know it stupid right now b but she was cut short but not because harry said anything but because she silenced as harry lifted her hand slowly to his lips she shuddered a bit as his soft lips pressed against her wounded hand a blushing fury rinsed across her face glad thing it was dark or else harry would ve seen her red face against the pink room much better harry asked smirking at her as he dropped her hand hermione nodded quickly and looked away you should ve not done that hermione said quietly i didntmean for it to happen you know hey i doing you a favor said harry moving closer to her look at it this way i am here because i want to make sure we re going to enjoy this holiday together it was all hermione wanted to hear i want to enjoy it too harry hermione said not looking at him i sorry about awhile ago dontbe said harry kindly moving closer to her that he was beside her you mean a lot to me and i made a promise years ago that i ll do anything to make sure my best friends stay happy he leaned forward i not going anywhere kiwi oh harry hermione couldntstop herself as she wrapped him in an adoring embrace around the torso she felt safe protected and happy with him harry hands hugged her back as his head rested on her head oh harry hermione repeated pressing her cheek against his body dontleave me it was the best thing for today hermione thought this was not going to be like four years ago after all a tear trickled down her cheek and rolled down to drip on her blanket she sighed and hugged her best friend so tight that she wondered how she ll ever pull away the next day hermione harry and alice were busy preparing the house for the arrival of the extended family of hermione the three took it upon themselves to shovel out the snow on the yard decorate the living room with more christmas ornaments and clean the kitchen all the while that christmas jazz music played in the background from the stereo mrs granger even helped in the cleaning when she took her brakes from her work as they sanitized the closet hermione felt in a better mood after last night with harry after they talked harry left for bed in the guestroom leaving her into a blissful feeling that made her sleep a lot more serene alice seemed to be less annoying as of late hermione thought despite her rant on how the christmas balls should be a bigger alice didntpush anything further to keep hermione in irate for the best of it hermione ignored alice the whole time and enjoyed herself as she and harry cleaned her bedroom together the cleaning of her bedroom had some memorable moments like how harry found her teddy bear snuggles under a pile of clothes inside her closet she held the urge to push harry away to hug her old teddy bear since she had always thought it was lost for the past five years i i ll take that harry she said taking snuggles from harry grasp almost hungrily as harry turned away to look into the closet depths hermione looked at snuggles and hugged him tightly only hiding the stuffed bear behind her back when harry emerged from the closet telling that everything was fixed another to point out was when harry found hermione baby pictures under the bed in a shoebox she couldntdescribe how embarrassed she felt when harry saw a picture of a three year old girl munching on oatmeal you re so adorable harry said in a goofy adoring face wow hermione snatched the picture and the box from him and shoved it under the bed before they went back to clean the rest of the room everyone went back to the kitchen to eat dinner when jacques granger came home with a friend hermione knew as eddie one of her parent fellow workmates at the clinic eddie couldntstay long because he had to go home to prepare to leave for paris france with his family apparently he lent the family van to jacques as he planned since he wouldntbe using it while he was abroad with a bidding farewell and a gift of cookies from monica eddie left the house where he ll go back home on foot as his house was only two blocks away where did you meet eddie uncle alice asked during dinner we met in bristol to get his van from the repair shop he was adding some extra oomph to the air conditioning but it winter alice said exactly now would you kindly pass the salad dear jacques smiled at alice after an all day work hermione found herself resting in the living room on the couch she sighed deeply as she sipped her hot chocolate while frank sinatra sang to her the christmas song on the stereo she placed her mug on the coffee table and relaxed you look relaxed alice voice said hermione turned and saw alice sit on the armchair in front of her alice wore a powder blue sweater and blue jogging pants that made her cerulean blue eyes look more obvious than before you look worn out hermione replied i was cleaning the bathroom mind you alice retorted great way to end the day eh hermione said lifting her legs to the couch not really alice said leering at hermione harry helped me anyway so it was worth it trying to keep her mind at ease hermione nodded that good she said it nice to know that you re just fond of my best friend of course i am said alice he such a gentleman your fifth gentleman hermione said alice eyes flashed what did you say she asked dangerously hermione sat up straight and said you heard me he could be your fifth alice looked murderous hermione smirked in pride that she got alice annoyed oh arentyou just a wonderful ray of sunshine alice drawled thank you hermione said ceremoniously i say the same to you alice not the two cousins threw daggers at each other but was cut short when harry entered hey he said sitting on the armchair beside alice what up nothing honey alice said reaching to touch harry hand hermione and i were just sharing another cousin moment the two girls exchanged looks of disgust hermione wished harry could pull his hand away anyway said harry his hand unmoving to let alice hold it we did it we cleaned the house without magic hermione said conversationally yeah without magic harry said indifferently there were times during the cleaning periods that harry wanted to use magic but after a promise made before they boarded the hogwarts express harry vowed he will do everything the muggle way while he stayed with hermione family you ve done your own magical charms harry said alice confidently i dontthink you need magic for that she winked harry smiled back and winked back hermione avoided looking at this and proceeded to drink her hot chocolate well said alice standing up i dead tired take out tired wontyou i ll go to bed early mom and dad are arriving tomorrow so i have to look well rested for them you really need it alice i being perfectly honest said hermione thoughtfully her voice filled with mockery alice glared at her i ll keep that in mind cousin dearest she said firmly good night hermione then her face broke into a gentle smile as she turned to harry good night harry and with a force of a thousand mallets hermione jaw dropped when alice pushed harry bangs and planted a quick kiss on his forehead bringing harry to an unending wave of redness hermione blinked a fire sparked in her gut and for all she knew she wanted to run and pull alice dark blonde hair so hard alice giggled winked at harry gave hermione a triumphant look and left the living room to the stairs harry looked beside himself he was fidgeting with his fingers stalwartly while he inhaled and exhaled quickly hermione wanted to punch him in the face harry hermione spat harry looked up at her his face looking obviously distracted instantly he walked up and sat beside her on the couch y yes he asked anxiously how was it hermione asked in an innocent singsong voice how was what harry asked you know what i talking about she punched him on the shoulder buddy ouch harry jumped rubbing his shoulder why did you do that for i thought men do that when they re really good friends hermione asked casually keeping her bubbling insides steady well i dontknow ron and i never punched each other harry said groaning as he rubbed his shoulder wow i thought you two were manly hermione muttered what nothing hermione said quickly what got into you hermione smiled sweetly does someone have a crush on dear alice lindell upland granger hermione said adorably harry eyes widened i er um you see oh god harry hermione chuckled i i donthave a crush on her but you do hermione pushed on scooting over to harry you cantstop thinking about her can you h hermione that m my business oh so you do like her hermione said her eyes twinkling harry did not answer but blushed hermione tilted her head cutely and pouted are you in love hermione harry cried stop it hermione laughed with fervor of a nutcase she shook her head and turned to her best friend you re too obvious harry hermione said you cantget enough of her hermione please not too loud i mean really harry i was expecting you to bag her sooner but one and a half days that not seeker material hermione urged on her mind racing with mad thoughts while her insides suppressed the potential explosion you re getting weird harry said his face as red as the red christmas baubles am i hermione asked sternly the two met silence and harry sighed feeling relieved that hermione did not ask anything else as her sanity surfaced hermione felt ashamed by her sudden outburst and drastically tried to find a way to change the subject hermione yes john the boy with the timid face glanced up to see alice chewing on a chunk of a twix bar at the kitchen john turned back to hermione who was in the living room with him and took a deep breath what is it hermione asked closing her book t there something i want to tell you he said turning red hermione smirked she knew what he was going to say after all the things he has done to make it so obvious and what would that be she asked casually grinning er he glanced at the kitchen i erm is it regarding allie a allie n no who said it was about her john said sweating from his brow hermione laughed softly oh johnny sweet dear and innocent johnny she said how obvious can you get john looked nervous now his hands were wringing and he bit his lip so hard that it looked like he was going to eat himself you like her dontyou hermione smiled broadly at john john blushed and made a nervous dry laugh what gave you that idea you give her chocolate every time you visit hermione pointed out isntchocolate the symbol of lo i i just want to show that i appreciate her that all ah appreciate hermione nodded you appreciate her johnny i meant in a friendly way i never said anything about the gesture being more than a friendly way hermione grinned so go on tell me that it true all right john groaned hermione i really like her i knew it hermione said kneeling on the couch excitedly dontmake it a big deal alright it just a crush but you like her hermione squeaked that good to know but dontsay it where she might hear it hermione john said looking around worriedly she wonthear us john hermione said but how long did you start liking her ever since day one the day we met he said dreamily awww you re getting your first summer fling she giggled hermione i need you to help me on getting her to like me he blurted out hermione smirked are you sure she might like you as we speak she asked slyly a girl like her like me john laughed it hopeless she laughed when i stumbled yesterday when we went to the ice cream parlor remember allie might have thought you were funny hermione said donttake it too personal and from what i can tell i think she really likes you too oh really yes really hermione nodded my tip is to just talk to her and keep her happy allie is one of the happiest beings i ever met so make sure she stays that way she ll like you more for that gee i dunno john winced i cantreally find ways to do that alice loves chocolate you got that one right said hermione now the next to do is to find out her interests she loves talking about what she interested in so that a good place to start and whatever you do keep away from conversations that might offend her like er anything that is offensive in general but she very tolerable about that stuff but it good to not stretch your chances here stretch your chances where kiwi said alice who strolled into the living room hi johnny hermione wanted to giggle at how alice smiled beautifully at john john chuckled and waved nervously at her get your act together you two hi allie johnny said his voice cool and calm er how was the twix bar oh it so delicious alice said happily i love twix i was so glad you gave me that as a gift i really am john thank you john nervously nodded and glanced at hermione you re doing okay she mouthed to him furtively putting her thumbs up john went back to alice and said no problem the two beamed at each other with significance that made hermione grin broadly well then hermione said picking up her book look at the time it looks like i have to do something before the day ends where are you going kiwi alice said wheeling around to hermione just in my bedroom said hermione dontworry though it wonttake too long you have johnny here to keep you company she winked at john alice turned to john and smiled sheepishly at him with a toothy grin that showcased her teeth i ll be off okay hermione said grinning from john to alice you two take care hermione immediately ran up the staircase and paused on the landing to listen to alice and john downstairs unsurprisingly she heard john pose the first question that would spark a dozen other ones leading to his closeness with alice stereo hermione said instantly sorry stereo she repeated as she stood up looked at the stereo that played frank sinatra singing christmas songs w what about it nothing hermione said quickly looking down i i just thought about listening to music that all without waiting for a reply hermione stopped the cd player pulled out the frank sinatra christmas songs cd and replaced it with a random disc which she played she did not turn to harry but she stared into the led that said 01 moon river instrumental the digital timer started as the familiar notes resonated the living room isntthat the same song you played on the violin yes hermione replied sadly hermione took an intake of breath and increased the volume of the song she closed her eyes as the song entered her ears and played a relaxing tune that she can only comprehend hermione felt much better now after her outburst then slowly she turned to harry and stood in front of him hermione harry stared at her is there something wrong nothing hermione smiled at him i just love this song the instrumentals soothed her ears while she recalled fond memories of dancing to this kind of music with her grandfather when he taught her how to dance she smiled remembering how many times she failed only to get up and improve herself until she got it right it been a really long time since she danced with her grandfather three years ago she wished she could dance again she has always loved dancing just one waltz would do her good to let her recent frustrations against alice ebb away and like last night an idea sparked in her head it was the perfect opportunity harry yeah er she turned to the stereo which continued to play the song this song what about it he looked at the stereo my grand p re and i erm danced to this when i was little so what are you saying he asked hermione bit her lip and found it queer that she felt nervous in asking him also quite fearful of rejection can you dance with me hermione lifted her hand harry gaped at her confusingly er i dontknow how to dance hermione the yule ball harry hermione brows furrowed i didnteven dance said harry sheepishly fine i ll teach you come on she pulled harry to full height and pushed the coffee table out of the way giving them more room er hermione i not sure about this harry said nervously come here she gestured him to move closer to her harry obeyed and was now in front of hermioe now put your hand on my waist she said placing harry hand on her waist erm sure harry said with uncertainty after going into proper position hermione hand on harry shoulder and their free hands holding each other hermione smiled now all you have to do is follow my lead since this is a slow song we ll just sway and turn got it yeah i think i do harry said looking down at his shoes you ll get it in time said hermione now hermione leaned closer to harry to the point their stomachs were touching this didntbother hermione but she noticed how awkward harry looked before saying follow me hermione swayed right while she synchronized her steps with the music harry grinning from ear to ear as he watched his step followed her movements to the music you re getting it harry hermione said after a few minutes of dancing i know harry chuckled twisting hermione around slowly it quite fun too my grandfather was a champion in many dancing tournaments and he taught me everything he knew hermione said proudly when she stopped spinning to hold on to harry in their previous position he a great teacher then said harry placidly hermione giggled and stopped on her steps thank you she said no problem harry said stepping away slowly i just hope i was good enough you know you were good hermione said holding her hands in front of her i really dontmind a boy with two left feet i that bad harry grimaced no hermione cried you re not i just saying that you re good for someone who hasntdance before oh harry chuckled sorry dontbe hermione reiterated her words the last time harry apologized i quite glad i haventdanced in years really harry eyes widened but you re very good and er fluid fluid pardon my lack of better term harry explained embarrassingly its fine hermione giggled sighed and took a step forward thank you by the way for for dancing with me even if it was short and even if i acted a bit she cocked her head sideward to the couch random awhile ago it all good said harry nodding besides i having fun anyway i glad you are hermione smiled well you ve been great through and through hermione you made me feel comfortable here he gestured his surroundings i cantsay i thanked you enough you re welcome said hermione happily squeezing harry hand affectionately the two looked at each other in silence as the song reached its final notes what was this feeling the feeling that bubbled inside her was different this time ever since alice has taken the role to spend harry for the past two days hermione found that every moment with harry was more valuable than ever but why did it make her so happy than she intended was she happy because she had harry all to herself tonight that she can express everything she wants with him what was this feeling hermione wondered why did she suddenly like the gleam in harry brilliant green eyes i cantdeny it he is handsome but was it because of the christmas setting that hermione found harry very nice tonight hermione harry asked hmmm she raised her eyebrows the world coming back to her i i think i better go to bed he said looking back at the stairs you know we need our rest since your aunts are arriving oh sure yeah i forgot hermione nodded blinking quickly how about you are you going to bed erm no not yet anyway hermione answered honestly oh well harry said breaking into a smile good night then good night hermione crossed her arms smiling back harry nodded and walked away to the staircase before he could climb up hermione suddenly called him harry she said what hermione walked up to him and said sweet dreams harry and with all the power she mustered she leaned forward and kissed harry on the cheek hermione moved away and her eyes widened when she just registered on what she did wow harry said quietly smirking at her er thanks harry reached for her shoulder squeezed it and said goodnight leaving hermione alone in the living room what did you just do hermione hermione touched her shoulder shuddered and gazed up at the stairs that harry clambered up and for the first time in her life hermione granger had no idea how to explain what she was feeling at the moment to be continued i sorry for being so zetta slow with the updates season 2 finale xxxvii hermione granger part iv dontbe nervous said monica i won t mum said hermione fixing her collar i was talking to harry dear monica said kindly are you alright harry hermione spun from the mirror in the living room to see harry wearing a checkered polo shirt trying to look best for the arrival of her aunts she smiled at his efforts as he raked his hair to make it look less untidy your hair is alright harry said monica fixing harry collar elphaba is always fond of untidy things though she can be a bit of a neat freak mom will love you said alice observing harry back especially your eyes since its green yeah i heard she loves green said harry she obsessed alice joked well her and my dad room is green when we got our new car dad gave her the privilege to pick the color and she picked green does she wear green harry asked yes said alice nodding because of her love of green st patrick day drives her into a green spree you re irish harry asked curiously grangers are part irish hermione pointed out walking up to them which explains why i wanted the irish to win when we watched the quidditch world cup remember i bet krum didntlike that harry chuckled who krum monica and alice asked a wave of red and realization dawned hermione face as she pulled harry by the collar responding j just a friend mum she chuckled nervously harry hermione grabbed harry by the arm and dragged him to a corner away from earshot what he finally asked donttell me they yes she said looking over his shoulder nervously er my mum and dad or anyone in the family for that matter have no idea that i used to have a boyfriend didntyou say that krum was just a just friends thing harry said at the moment asking that is futile so just shush she lifted a finger at harry but i have to ask you to please not push on the subject in front of my parents why because she paused and recollected how awkward this may sound b because my mum and dad will go ballistic n no said hermione twiddling her thumbs it would ve been fine if i told them immediately after the yule ball but it been three years exactly hermione nodded they might think i was holding out on them my dad will kill me easy kiwi harry held her by the shoulders i promise i wonttell anyone thank you harry no problem he smirked just dontcall me kiwi sure thing kiwi hermione punched him on the shoulder so hard that her knuckles cracked on collision to harry hard shoulder ah hermione squeaked holding her knuckles that throbbed painfully a are you alright harry took her by the wrist carefully to look at her hand i just punched a trained quidditch player shoulder do you think i alright i fine she said weakly reeling her hand away from harry grasp beep beep the sound of the car horn echoed across the living room from the outside oh they re here said monica looking out the window that was quite fast for uncle jac jac to go forth and back from the airport said alice excitedly looking out the wide window i bet he doing his speed driving again monica said with a hint of contempt she has always disapproved of her husband fast driving we re home said the voice of jacques from the outside oh look at that mimi and didi are excited cue to this hermione heard scuffling and talking about from the outside and a knock on the door monica quickly dashed to open the door when the cry of twin children called out aunt monmon hermione smiled broadly when two identical blonde haired children hugged monica by the leg mimi didi monica said happily hugging her nieces you ve grown so big monica glinda a short blonde haired woman passed through the threshold to hug her sister she was nearing her forties had blue eyes and gave a sense of motherliness in her overall disposition considering her white dress matched the snowy outdoors this was hermione aunt glinda aunt glinda alice greeted happily as she trotted towards her hermione followed alice but was pushed back by a strong force around her legs hermione squealed two voices below her looking down hermione eyes met the identical twins called mimi and didi mimi said hermione crouching lower to hug the two didi awww i missed the both of you we missed you more said mimi in a very cute voice yeah we were sooo excited to see our big sister again said didi adorably oh you shouldntreally call me that said hermione kindly swelling with pride i think you re more than welcome to be called so said aunt glinda looking down at her aunt glinda hermione stood up and kissed her aunt on the cheek kiwi glinda said sweetly my my you ve grown taller hermione blushed a bit and smiled weakly at her she did not know what she was blushing for being called by her nickname or hearing her aunt say that she has grown taller not to mention glinda added holding hermione by the cheek you look a lot prettier than i last saw you before she could blush even more a very american voice from the outside called out jacques would you give us a hand here i on my way i on my way said jacques recognizable voice boys said the other help your uncle here as hermione heard this another woman entered the door this woman was taller than aunt glinda and wore a green owl neck sweater and matching earrings aunt elphie hermione squeaked as she flung her arms around her aunt elphaba oh hermione easy there said elphaba pushing her niece away i glad to see you too hermione smiled broadly while alice greeted her mother with a kiss as this happened a few people entered led by her father and a sandy haired man carrying a large trunk behind them were three boys a short stout one a tall one and the last one who looked like he played many sports these three carried bags and luggage of many sizes need any help dear monica asked to jacques yeah we need lots and lots of help thank you said the tall boy sarcastically carrying two duffel bags to the living room in fact i think a spot of iced tea would do the trick drinking a cold drink in christmas is murder the stout boy replied irritably as he pulled a stroller bag into the threshold hey stop arguing and move spat the last boy outside who are they harry asked behind hermione oh those are aunt glinda children hermione explained quickly i ll introduce you to them later where krista in the car looking for her teddy bear aunt glinda reckoned allie help your cousins with the bags said elphaba no no said jacques shifting the trunk to the living room fierro the boys and i got it elves you mean said the tall boy jokingly wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his trench coat ever since the trip i ve been treated like a servant boy destined to be if you ask me said a drawling voice from the door everyone turned to see a handsome looking boy enter the house wearing headphones cynic as always eh jericho said the tall boy that jericho hermione heard alice say to harry the angelic brother i told you about boys said aunt glinda sternly making her sons jump show some manners and greet your relatives comically the tall one hopped or trotted hermione could not tell as the stout and the other one followed aunt monica the three greeted monica by kissing her on the cheek one by one aunt elphaba said the tall one hugging his aunt it been awhile what are you talking about said alice chuckling you were with her the whole time good point he said pointedly pulled away and smirked at alice just four days allie and i missed ya as alice kissed him on the cheek the tall boy turned to hermione and smiled broadly well well well if it isnthermione he said happily hermione waved back timidly she realized she hasntseen her other cousins for years now are they the same as the last time she met them how school asked the stout boy appearing beside her how life asked the third of the brothers and more importantly how are the books i sent you last year for your birthday asked the tall one crossing his arms hermione laughed i loved it she said i never knew you could find such a weird and funny book five hours in the university library doesnthurt he replied with a smile thank you said hermione turning to the stout boy where your sister cue to this a small girl entered the threshold carrying a very large bag bigger than her around her left arm was a white teddy bear dressed in a brown shirt right there said the tall boy hold on here krista i ll help you while helping the little girl named krista hermione turned to the youngest of the boys i thought matt coming he outside helping with the luggage said the youngest i guess you can say we re all here and ready to go the tall boy and his sister named krista

still two months later before hermione could reply she felt someone tug her skirt looking down mimi gazed at her for a few seconds before saying who he she pointed behind hermione hermione spun around and saw harry hovering beside the stair railings awkwardly a boy in hermione house said the tall one in mock disbelief even i cantget a girl to stay in my house that because the last one was too conservative the stout boy remarked oh hermione said walking to harry and grabbing him by the wrist er he she pulled him towards them is my best friend from school hermione pulled harry in front of them and smiled at her cousins then to harry who looked nervous we cantcall him best friend from school all the time right the tall boy asked uncertainly hermione giggled no hermione said grabbing

brilliant green eyes said elphaba blatantly ignoring glinda forward at times glinda said while she hung her head slightly hermione giggled and remembered glinda intolerance of elphaba antics back when the two were at secondary school years ago m my eyes harry asked innocently putting his hands behind his back er thank you i told you my mom loves green said alice walking in between the two mom this is the charming new friend i mentioned i can see that said elphaba beaming down at harry you seem quite shy though he just nervous around new people said alice winking at harry give new people some space and they ll be fine said a sandy haired man who appeared at the shoulder of elphaba harry alice said dragging harry by the wrist meet my dad fierro he nodded with a toothless grin nice to meet you he added as he lifted his hand to shake pleasure harry said taking his hand quickly dad this is the boy i was talking about said alice gesturing harry in my last email remember ah yes i think i remember he looked at harry with a friendly nod you must be hermione best friend then harry gazed at hermione who nodded to her uncle fierro y yeah hermione stepped forward beside harry he my best friend he came here with me for the holidays actually said alice harry was supposed to go to sweden romania harry corrected her alice paused and blushed sorry she winced apologetically at harry it fine said harry anyone can make mistakes you re just er blonde hermione said loudly before she could stop herself what harry elphaba and fierro said in unison hermione clapped her mouth shook her head and took a step backward alice looked confused but eyed hermione apprehensively never mind hermione finally replied behind her mouth luckily the three shook it off though hermione swore she saw a glint of suspicion in harry eyes and went back to talking anyway said fierro nice to meet you but we can talk later elphie he turned to her your bag is there already oh thank you honey elphaba said then turned to harry well i have things to attend to alright i ll get to know you more later i hope and with that elphaba and fierro left the three hermione then felt someone grab her by the wrist as she spun to the kitchen harry released her grasp and looked at her anxiously what was that for said hermione irritably i heard what you said about alice said harry quietly hermione blinked but did not reply did you say blonde harry asked no hermione lied immediately why on earth would i say that for your information hermione said harry alice is a smart girl as smart as you to be honest i didntcall her blonde hermione lied you did said harry dontlie to me hermione hermione bowed her head and heard harry tisked impatiently why are you doing this to allie harry asked desperately you ve been nothing but mean to her if you ask me just drop it harry hermione spat angrily i dontwant to get into another argument with you but can you at least tell me why obviously there is something wrong here nothing is wrong harry hermione pushed on c mon i might help you no please i won t fair enough just dontgo on lying to me said harry darkly hermione crossed her arms and glared the floor hermione harry said he sounded angry now as he spun her to face him dontlie to me hermione realized that harry was holding her tightly around the wrist his grip was too strong that she winced while her eyes were on harry y you re hurting me hermione spoke softly the two turned their gaze below and harry briskly let go off her i sorry said harry i i didntmean to harry the two gryffindors turned as alice slid across the kitchen towards harry my mom is calling you the family wants to get to know you she said enthusiastically harry shot a look to hermione he looked at her then at her wrist that she massaged gradually hermione looked at harry with apprehension and nodded to him i think you need to get acquainted to them said hermione enigmatically come leading the two hermione led alice and harry to the living room the whole family was there sitting at the couches and armchairs exchanging stories and what not hermione rubbed her wrist as it throbbed i i need to go to the bathroom hermione said not looking at alice and harry excuse me she steered herself not for the first floor bathroom but went upstairs to her room shutting the door hermione leaned on the door and looked at her wrist no hermione it not like that it not like before not like that you didnteven burn anyone hermione rubbed her temple annoyingly and assured herself one important fact this is the present that was the past harry just acted on natural reaction that all she groaned and leaned her head back that it touched the door go down and act civil now no blonde jokes without further ado she brushed the front of her long skirt and left the room during the first hours of their arrival hermione got around to be with harry to help him get to know her relatives more much to her delight alice wasntavailable since she had to help her mother with some thing related to luggage but before they could even do so hermione swallowed every bit of her own embarrassment and faced harry before they left the kitchen the area where she saw him after she left the room hey she said harry she smiled feebly at him as he drank his glass of water hmmm he asked raising his eyebrows gulping the water down hermione looked away a bit bit her lip as she interlocked her fingers together ummm i just want to say save it said harry putting the glass down what hermione looked up to her surprising delight he was smiling i said save it he walked up to her you know shut up he chuckled because if we both know what best for the both of us and that is to shut up right while taken aback at this hermione knew what he meant and nodded but can i at least let you know she said quietly know what that i sorry about awhile ago it not big deal said harry scratching his nose let bygones be bygones something was up hermione observed harry features and noticed he looked normal but gave off the air of something strange what wrong harry asked hermione brows furrowed and asked did something happen while i was away what do you mean said harry you re looking too happy and you got me off the hook easily hermione pointed out suddenly harry laughed and said i dontknow what you re getting hermione but whatever it is it nothing really i just want us to enjoy the season it seemed like a fair answer hermione would not want to spend the next week in animosity with her best friend but she canthelp but feel a bit curious on why harry felt different right now anyway she continued dropping the subject i was thinking to let you get to know my relatives more ummm sure but if you re going to let your aunt elphie talk to me then you re going to get a lot of interesting stuff harry said what wrong with my aunt elphie hermione asked defensively nothing bad harry raised his hands in defense while you were away she couldntget enough of my eyes hermione laughed i told you she loves green she can be pretty creepy about it if you ask me harry made a mock shiver and laughed but i like her she very nice so would you like to get this over with and talk with the others hermione asked they are going to love you i sure of it fine said harry holding on to her shoulder but only if you allow me to call you kiwi without you complaining about it hermione eye twitched you clever little sneak said hermione glaring at harry but fine if that will keep you from begging to call me that like a lost puppy deal said harry taking out what left in the glass let meet them now shall we hermione smiled and followed harry out of the kitchen only to stop when harry turned oh yeah said harry his hands about to open the double swing doors of the kitchen into the dining room do you know why i got you off easy hermione looked at him quizzically harry looked at her enigmatically smiled sweetly and said because she told me that you wouldntenjoy a second of your christmas without your best friend by you she my mum hermione winced why would her mother get into this no said harry chuckling alice told me hermione jaw dropped slightly before she could reply she took a double take and blinked a bit before replying a alice yeah said harry distractedly hermione what shall we he gestured to the door your family cantwait long shaking off whatever she felt now hermione nodded and followed harry out of the kitchen through the swinging doors summer 1991 the sun shone brightly over the park which was located near hermione home it was a great day for hermione to spend time with alice outside instead of being in the house all day the two sat right by the tiled walkway that slithered across the small park eating blue colored popsicles which hermione called sea salt ice cream they taste funny said alice sniffing her popsicle they do but you ll get the hang of it when you spend time eating it hermione replied licking her own i guess said alice hesitatingly opening her mouth to suck on the ice cream she let it out quickly and groaned what wrong allie hermione turned to her cousin i sorry but i cantreally get into it she sighed i so sorry kiwi dontbe said hermione reaching for alice popsicle as her cousin handed it to her at least i have two now she giggled alice eyed hermione calmly which hermione caught what with the look she asked nothing said alice i just feel happy that you re still being yourself even after that hogwarts problem i really dontneed it to be a problem to be honest said hermione besides it could be a prank set up by mean boys but how about the weird things that you mentioned to me alice asked i know they are things that cantbe answered yet but you cantdeny that they happened i really have no idea allie said hermione turning to her cousin i just hate it that there a small part of me that thinks that i should push further into figuring it out i have no idea what to do you ll figure something out alice said tapping her lap i know you probably wontbut telling your mom and dad is the best thing you ll ever do i know but i scared said hermione but what am i scared about i mean they must think i mental remember the saying kiwi the sanest person in the world is the one who admits he crazy alice made a point hermione did admit once that she might be crazy but would that make her sane the thematics behind alice saying made hermione brain rattle are you alright hermione alice asked kindly you re rubbing your temples again i fine allie she said i just somewhat indifferent about all this that all alice placed a hand on hermione and beamed at her cousin everything is going to be fine kiwi i ll be there by your side alright it was more than enough to keep hermione in check as long as she has her cousin support nothing will ever go wrong well except for one thing hey yelled a mockingly loud voice the voice that sent a thousand shivers of shock and anguish down hermione spine echoed across the park from where the two girls sat hermione turned a dreadful head and saw the last two people she wouldntwant to meet k kiwi alice asked anxiously who are they as dustin and lyle two of hermione most hated boys in the world walked up the walkway one of them was juggling a large ball that looked much like a softball hermione looked wary and scooted closer to alice well well well said dustin disgustingly wiping his sweat from his forehead if it isntgranger the stranger hermione hushed alice the moment she heard her cousin gasp at such an insult this was the one thing she would never want her cousin to see her two bullies what do you want hermione asked acidly she wasntgoing to back down from them that easily alice is here i cantlet them harm her nice question said lyle pulling up his shorts arrogantly as he walked right in front of hermione i think it pretty easy to know what it is eh granger hermione glared at lyle before someone suddenly wrenched her ice cream from her arm hey she heard alice squeal nice ice cream pop said dustin smacking his lips at it it free right why you hermione screeched and tried to reach for dustin but was interrupted when lyle instantly grabbed the other popsicle from her grasp kiwi alice screamed nice catch eh said lyle laughing his ass off free popsicles and making sure we ll get a cry out of you hermione was in utmost rage she stood up and glared at the two what now granger dustin asked smirking leave us alone hermione yelled us lyle looked at her stupidly oi lyle look y here said dustin pointing to alice sitting stiffly on her chair another granger leave her alone hermione growled stepping in front of dustin way k kiwi please dontget hurt alice spoke behind her it must be her sister said lyle mockingly hey dust you think she too aintright in the i said leave her out of this hermione yelled thankfully the park was almost next to empty being the in the center of it hermione would doubt that anyone would hear them ooooh the boys said in unison granger the stranger is putting up a fight stop calling her that alice suddenly shouted on her seat hermione spun around and held alice by her arms please allie dontget involved hermione said in a voice filled with urgency i can handle this but just sit down allie hermione said i dontwant you to get hurt of course she wants you sit down said lyle because granger here doesntwant your support i said shut up lyle hermione turned on her heel to glare at lyle whatever said lyle biting off the popsicle eh dustin waved a lazy hand at hermione it better that you stand for yourself since the image of you having a friend to help you is utterly daunting hermione clubbed her fist but stood her ground anyway back off barked dustin as he shoved hermione out of the way lyle passing them by to approach alice hey hermione yelled trying to push dustin out of the way to go to alice dont dontyou dare k kiwi alice shrunk at the size of lyle alice is not a fighter hermione do something lookie here dust said lyle bending over alice this one here a beauty aintit hermione caught alice fearful face her cerulean blue eyes terrifyingly turning from the closeness lyle face to hermione brown eyes allie hermione didntknow why but it was at this moment in between the very pinch of time and space that she was undeniably angry the look of helplessness in her most beloved cousin eyes was the one thing she could never stand the idea of alice being hurt it was one thing she would never want to see why dontyou stand up mocked lyle in a loud voice are you scared i said hermione finally yelled shoving dustin away leave her alone bang bang bang in the sudden moment of time a blinding flash temporarily blurred hermione vision as the familiar sounds of fire and screaming echoed across the sky aahhh kiwi the sound of her cousin voice brought hermione vision into full looking at the scenario before her hermione couldnttell what was happening dustin and lyle heads were burning in a turmoil of flame and fury their arms flailed madly as they danced on the spot alice scooting back on her seat aahhhhhh argh yelled the two boys in torment then she saw it again on their heads dancing blue bell flames oh no the boys writhed everywhere wildly that they ran across the parkway walkway to jump at the nearby pond to extinguish the fire but it wasntover bash hermione jumped and fell on the ground as two trash bins flew out of nowhere towards the boys knocking them off their feet the two screamed as their heads burned it was too much for hermione now but it wasntover not yet as the boys stood on their feet frantically for the pond which was just a pinch away from them a couple of stones emerged from the shorelines of the pond as if an invisible person held them the rocks looked marginally smaller than a soccer ball but it was big enough to knock someone out cold is it going to aim at their skulls the boys arrived on the shoreline heads ablazing preparing to take the dive but the sight of the two floating rocks before them made them freeze figuring out at how chaotic this will end up being hermione quickly yelled no wait she raised her hand at the general direction of the boys in a split second the rocks fell right on the shoreline in a squishy thud alice gasped hermione eyes widened ignoring the yell of the boys as they jumped into the pond extinguishing their heads at last the park echoed with nothing but the splashing and the yelping of the boys hermione say there frozen at what just happened did i just stop those rocks no impossible she felt numb hermione just sat there on the ground feeling as if she just froze over kiwi hermione snapped her neck towards alice both unharmed but shaken her face looking anxiously on her seat at the distance the boys emerged from the pond at the other side and ran crying about as they went their heads looked charred and ashy and from the looks of things they probably would be in pain for the long months to come what just happened ere said a man voice to hermione right hermione looked up and saw a man with a handsome face he was tall had long brown hair and his features looked rough to smooth i hermione finally spoke what are you doing down there the man asked looking down at hermione hermione immediately stood up and fixed herself she walked over to alice and sat beside her from the looks of things alice looked shaken and shocked but she did not show any signs of crying are you alright allie hermione asked quietly putting an arm around her cousin alice turned to hermione with a curious expression whatever it was hermione knew what it meant at the corner of her eye she noticed the man looking at them with a face of concern y yes hermione asked turning to him do you need anything n nothing in particular he said his voice with a light scottish accent is she alright hermione looked at alice and nodded to the man we re fine thank you said alice quietly the man smiled for some reason he gave off the air of comfort something was different about him those two boys giving you a hard time yeah he said crouching before them so his eyes were level to the two girls the two girls did nothing but nod at him the man chuckled and reached for his pockets here he handed alice a kerchief you look like you ve been burned hermione now noticed that alice had some blackened hands did the blue bell flames catch her too they re not burns said alice kindly but thank you the man nodded and stood up pocketing the kerchief as he did well as long as i know that you two young girls are healthy i guess i have to take a move on he said grinning t thank you sir said hermione for you know checking on us dontmention it he said putting his hands on his knees i had bullies in my time but i wouldntflame them to hell now would i hermione shot a look at the man who winked at her hermione looked down and noticed a wooden stick sheathed in his pocket like a wand n no she said looking up at him i dontthink it would be nice he laughed heartily and fixed his rucksack over his shoulders excellent then he smiled at the girls oh look at the time i must be going then so see you in another life yeah he waved at the two girls and began his trek down the walkway wait hermione got out of her seat calling out the man he turned to her and raised his eyebrows at her what your name mister she asked innocently there was a few seconds before he gave out another smile and spoke it desmond he answered and with a final wave he turned on his heel and walked off hermione wanted to call out to him but out of stress and the pinch of reluctance she closed her mouth and did nothing but watch desmond disappear at the distance there was nothing but talk and bonding that day hermione got harry and her relatives to know each other more for the early parts of the afternoon she had to expect it but their questions were rather too much hermione harry and her four cousins aunt glinda sons according to kent krista was fast asleep in the guestroom sat at the living room while the rest were busy with things packing i guess thought hermione how long have you known hermione asked kent sitting on the couch looking tired hermione realized that they must be experiencing jetlag seven years now said harry seated at the armchair facing the three sons of aunt glinda in fact she one of the first best friends in my life i see kent nodded and chuckled hermione seated on the arm of the armchair rolled her eyes oh god kent she said the day i find you with nothing interesting to say i going to eat kiwifruit i sorry i just have jetlag problems alright he pointed out shaking his head from drowsiness kent is usually talkative said hermione looking at harry and tends to have something to say about everything not everything said kent leaning forward my mom wanted to say a speech during her birthday two years ago remember that kline i dunno he made shrugged his shoulders his eyes set on a rubik cube yeah you dunno anything said kent sarcastically and moved to harry anyway i just couldntsay anything because there are times i could go about unexpectedly obnoxious oh said harry with uncertainty i see see kent gestured to harry looking at hermione we re both speaking the same dialogue to each other that i think we might even want to do something else oh shut it hermione waved a hand at him the only thing you want to do is sleep instead of catching on with long lost relatives we send emails every week kiwi said kent in aghast it not like we dontsee each other everyday though we do realistically speaking see he has a say on everything hermione said to harry laughing but dontworry because whatever he has to say they make him loveable speaking of loveable said the cousin his stupor getting the most of him as his voice sounded offhanded sorry but he laughed but i have to ask out of curiosity but have you two ever got together nope said harry casually hermione furrowed her brows that a bit beyond the line isntit kent you told me to say something interesting he raised his hands defensively ayyy kelvin sighed as he stood up would you excuse me but i have to ask mom about my books harry passed a quizzical look at kent who answered he has midterms after holidays so yeah he nodded humorously he going to ask santa an interesting present but you still haventanswered my question hermione said kent if harry said no obviously it would make my answer the same said hermione glaring well you might say he could be boyfriend but he doesntknow about it kent said awkwardly i mean it happened to kline here during our days of grade school but still it illogical for you to say such things hermione retorted i taking this question and cutting all corners said kent i mean you might be doing it right now he turned to harry hey have you noticed anything strange or romantic about hermione harry looked at hermione and squinted at her what he actually taking his question seriously a glint of suspicion rose in harry green eyes what was that oh god he actually thinking i showing something romantic towards him well i canttell said harry ah i canttell kent shook his head tsk tsk tsk that not a good sign hermione fine hermione crossed her arms my answer is no i love you cousin dearest kent blinked lovingly at her squatter kline said shaking his head at his brother all the while solving his rubik cube moving on said hermione uncrossing her arms her anger ebbing away if you dontknow we re spending the rest of the vacation at grand p re starting tomorrow tomorrow kline eyes widened i just unpacked at the guest room you dropped your bag and left the room that not unpacking kent exclaimed i should be the one who should be shocked i unpacked the nintendo 64 already your loss cousin dearest said hermione laughing yeah laugh all you want said kent in mock sadness no one knows the sufferings of a man who packs after another moment of bonding the rest of the day drove on with everyone getting ready for the departure for the country home hermione was feeling quite happy that she gets to spend the whole day with harry packing in her room for the trip tomorrow but something bothered her why did harry look at her suspiciously when kent asked the question if she showed off anything romantics towards him it not like i showing any but have i dontbe stupid she thought you did show some sort of signs that could ve been misinterpreted like your kiss last night before you went to bed remember i wouldntcall that romantic dontbe stupid hey said harry hermione turned to him and saw he was handing her a cardigan this is yours harry continued i found it among my stuff last night feeling a bit dazed from her inner mind argument she distractedly took the cardigan and folded it silently he wouldntthink that was something romantic right i mean it was just a kiss on the cheek but it came after a dance hermione thought bollocks she suddenly felt embarrassed at what she did her own consciousness took the best of her that she was already feeling borderline paranoid calm down hermione it not like anything weird will happen harry is still here and he ll surely not ask a single thing about it you okay kiwi harry asked quickly snapping out of it hermione nodded and added a smile to go you sure said harry folding his clothes inside his trunk it looks like you ve been thinking of something the last thing hermione wanted was a conversation regarding what happened last night it was best that she steered to other topics i ve been thinking of my grandfather hermione explained i haventseen him in a while oh said harry for a second i thought something dreadful has bothered you he added with a laugh very funny said hermione transferring her clothes from the trunk to a duffel bag so what does your country home look like harry asked it beautiful said hermione it not very far just a three to four hour trip is all it needs to get there hermione then went on how it was a great place to live in it sat in a forested area with other houses the two story building was big enough to fit many people from the front of the house a double door welcomed guess into a foyer and living room beyond according to her the living room was a large room with a high ceiling that took the both the structures two stories to the left of the living room is where the kitchen and the dining room were a set of stairs located near the dining room entrance led one to the upstairs portion of the house this is where the rooms were located the backyard led to a wide porch fit for parties beyond the porch there lay a small lake and a tree line leading into the deep forest apparently the country home of her grandfather shares this small lake with three other houses so basically the houses surrounded the lake like a wreath what time are we leaving harry asked five in the morning said hermione i know it too early but that my father for you always an early bird reminds me of someone i know said harry not meeting hermione eyes hermione glanced at harry and grinned shaking her head at his remark by the way i like your relatives said harry turning to her they re really nice and all haha thanks said hermione i knew you d love them in fact harry continued i enjoying this trip so far hermione met harry eyes and saw he really meant it the way he beamed at her his kindness getting the most of him it made hermione happy and mind you i dontregret missing the romania trip so he cleared his throat thanks hermione hermione felt harry hand on her shoulder she didntlook at it but she really felt all his feelings from that simple touch it was enough to make her go to alice and give her a good ha in triumph there you go said harry dropping his hands you look happy now i am said hermione quietly hiding her broad smile from harry by turning away to grab her sweater from the trunk maybe because you re here with me what was this feeling she was getting anyway there was something lingering in her gut that told her she was experiencing some uncharted territory could it be that her earlier frustrations over alice spending time with harry more than her caused some sort of secret happiness that she wants harry to be with her i not afraid to think that that i happy about being here with harry but why should she be afraid it not like they re romantic feelings yeah i doubt harry would think i am showing any signs i mean i dontwant to cause anything awkward but what was that small feeling behind her head it kept prickling behind her back like a bothersome fly hermione couldntdeny it but ever since alice arrived she canthelp but feel threatened that a girl like her has entered harry life at this point she doesntwant harry to be with her out of hatred but what does that make her it not her place to tell harry who to fancy or not she has no control over that so why in the world is she feeling so possessive over him when alice isntaround she feels like being with harry is almost a godsend almost as if she really likes him and now with the question raised by her cousin she doesntwant anything awkward to happen between the harry and her if harry does suspect anything what is this feeling oh my merlin i so confused maybe she needs to cut some slack and relax yeah i overthinking too much god i cantbelieve i letting a question and some run of the mill idea get the better of me so silly hermione i need to go to the bathroom harry finally said folding the last of his clothes into a duffel bag hermione lent him be back in a few minutes harry stood up and walked out on the threshold only to bump into alice at the hallway oh allie said harry his voice becoming suddenly hoarse i er was going to go to the bathroom i see she replied hey i haventtalked to you today y yeah i noticed harry scratched the back of his head awkwardly dontworry we have lots of time when we reach grandpa tomorrow said alice there goes the feeling again hermione suddenly felt a small jolt of annoyance over alice airy attitude it is as if she is high as a kite oh i better go harry said quickly thumbing behind him so um later later then alice said hermione did not want to further anything else with alice so she decided to finalize the packaging of her duffel bag taking only what she needed read lots of books it was only a matter of time until she felt that familiar feeling of being watched what do you want hermione asked stiffly knowing very well who was still standing by her door wheeling around she saw alice looking back at her with an air of indifference and sternness well hermione asked surprisingly instead of a retort alice walked into the room and handed hermione a red box with the size of a shoebox er mom wanted to give you this she said she told me to tell you to not open it until christmas eve sure said hermione taking the red box rather quickly tell her i said thanks setting the box in a small space in her duffel bag she still felt alice being there what is it hermione looked up at alice who was standing before her can you see that i busy i just wanted to ask you one question alice said suddenly looking red in the face fire away i donthave all day said hermione standing up to check her drawers for any thing she might have missed it about harry hermione froze half opening the second drawer yeah i knew you would stiff up like that alice said quietly what about harry hermione asked conversationally keeping her voice even er said alice hesitantly just spit it out already if you re going to ask me if he is single then congratulations said hermione closing and opening the drawers randomly because harry is quite free um quite quite do you have to nitpick my statements it means alice hermione turned on her heel to face her that he not in the burden of a female companion aka a girlfriend oh said alice i see anything else hermione asked lamely not catching alice deep in thought stance nothing she replied i ll be going now good riddance make sure you open that present on christmas eve said alice from the door aunt glinda says it important you should do so hermione sighed as alice finally left looking back it feels strange for alice to be in the same room with her but even stranger that alice was less cocky than before in fact the trademark serenity that alice tends to emanate got to the bookworm in a non negative way i ll never understand that woman likewise alice would probably never understand what she feels about her right now unless of course a miracle happens hermione couldntbare it but as the number of days alice has spent time here in this house the memories of the past tend to overwhelm her to a degree that made it look like as if fate wanted her to remember them summer of 1991 hermione never stopped thinking about what she did yesterday you re thinking this too much hermione you probably didntdo it how on earth did she make those blue flames appear there was obviously no explanation to it as the young bookworm stared into the summer sky from her bedroom window she played the mind game and remembered how much chaos she caused i did that no doubt about it but if i did do it then how much more can i do i cantcontrol it it like i m a mutant or something but how is this possible no books can answer this while she has encountered the paranormal in her past such as making her teddy bear float or see her classmate hair turn red when he annoyed her they all cantbe explained by logic am i some experiment or something she asked herself the idea of being some government experiment crossed her mind could it be possible that during a forgotten memory someone broke her free from the clutches of an experiment an left her here in this place she calls home that stupid hermione but what if it were true what if she is some mutant a group of people created maybe someone is monitoring her every move that if she were ready they would take her from her family and make her do extraordinary things for their benefit stop thinking that hermione hermione held onto her head and rubbed it vigorously she wanted this big question to end is there a mutant academy i can go to speaking of academies the letter from hogwarts sprung up in her mind are the letters and her so called powers connected how could they know about her or is this just one big prank i cantturn away from what i know this cantbe a prank maybe this school of witchcraft and wizardry is the answer to her problems connecting the dots it probable that her powers are currently uncontrollable and that this school can help her control it but i cantassume it real true she cantjust say that there is a school that teaches magic because the idea of a place where people teach kids to pull a rabbit out of there hat sounds like a big waste of time the evidence of what i can do shows that there is a possibility that it exists you ve been quiet for the past day kiwi hermione snapped out of her reverie and turned to alice i ve been thinking a lot allie said hermione sitting on her bed i ve been thinking too said alice about what you assume you did really yeah said alice i dontknow about you but i think you re actually special hermione did not say anything so alice continued what i trying to say is if you are like this maybe it uncontrollable so alice has been thinking the same thoughts hermione thought and that this school hogwarts is the best way to know how to control it alice moved towards the dresser and took the hogwarts letter from the drawer kiwi this could be the ultimate answer to all your questions but what about my doubts hermione asked doubts you cantdeny it hermione alice said you have something special inside of you i can feel it honestly hermione cantdeny it but the whole thing seems too farfetched i dontknow allie hermione scratched her head it just too much for me but kiwi look allie hermione explained it not just simple what if i dangerous what if this school turns me out for the worse like an experiment or something you re reading too much science fiction said alice with concern i must be besides alice continued i think this could be good for you i mean you get to be unique in the family but i dontwant to be a freak hermione blurted out freak alice raised her eyebrows people can be different and not be labeled a freak look at me hermione wanted to laugh she really wanted to but she was too confused and the utter idea of more people calling her a freak because of this made her somewhat angry it not like that allie hermione said awkwardly what just because two boys insulted you does that make you any lesser of a person alice said sternly hermione has never seen alice this annoyed no not that said hermione alright fine those two boys they ve been bullying me for the past few years alice gave hermione a look of pity i hermione continued i didntwant you to know why the thought of why boiled inside hermione why would she let alice know that for the past few years she been nothing but a human target for people just because she different she doesntwant alice to know these things because these are the things that make her angry hermione would never want to share some negativity to alice who has brought nothing but happiness in her life because of the sole reason of insecurity she did not want alice to worry her too much too but she answered anyway because said hermione sadness in her voice those boys made me miserable for a long time alice simply stared at hermione with the same look of pity hermione however continued for the past few years they ve been nothing but a thorn on my side she breathed heavily they ve hurt my feelings humiliated me damaged my reputation to others kiwi said alice her eyes watering hermione felt like crying too she has never opened up about this issue to anyone and just because of my differences i suddenly a bad person hermione said with contempt i just dontget it the few words she wanted to let out in a long time the feeling was unbelievably satisfying why she said quietly looking at alice why am i like this allie why do people pick on me k kiwi please dontbeat yourself up alice squeaked i didntwant you to know because you d be too worried about me said hermione but you know what alice sniffed which hermione took as a response when they burned and got hurt in the park the other day she said her anger and sadness getting the best of her a small part of me made me feel that i i enjoyed it hermione stood up slowly now i enjoyed it hermione said her voice cracking up while her eyes turned watery i enjoyed every bit of their pain she looked at alice who was now in tears you re not a bad person kiwi dontthink that but they deserved it hermione blurted out those boys over there who cried for their mothers deserved it sure while i mortified at seeing all this happen right before my eyes but looking back i think it time they need to know their lesson kiwi stop that said alice you d never want to hurt anyone out of spite i dontcare hermione spat tears rolling down her cheeks maybe this this magic school thing you know maybe this is why i have these powers maybe that why i a freak they ve been tormenting me for the past few years and maybe it time for me to show them what i made off kiwi alice moved forward to hold hermione by the hand calm down wontyou you sound like the bad guy now hermione was confused herself at this side knowing what she can do maybe it time she gave dustin and lyle a piece of her mind while on this side she is shocked at her dark thoughts kiwi said alice stroking her cousin hand just take the leap of faith you can still be able to control this she handed her the hogwarts letter what you ve waited for i mean you can have all you ever wanted i know said hermione darkly but something has changed within me something is not the same what do you mean i through with playing by the rules of someone else game is what i mean said hermione angrily kiwi alice said loudly feeling panicked canti make you understand you re having delusions of grandeur hermione looked at alice cerulean blue eyes the way they yearned for her cousin peace of mind something about it made her keep calm kiwi alice moaned i love you i dontwant you to think this you re given this special gift not to hurt anyone because you are not a bad person because you ll be as worse as the boys who bullied you if you hurt them it was at this moment that hermione calmed down a wave of embarrassment hit her that she kneeled down and started crying oh god allie she sobbed i cantbelieve what i just said oh kiwi alice said hugging her cousin shhh calm down it alright i here hermione hugged her cousin back and felt this rush of relief while feeling dumb for blurting all her feelings out letting them all out of her heart has healed her of the contempt she held towards most of her life look we can figure this out alright alice said you re just frustrated at all this and you know what the only way to help you is taking that letter and showing it to your parents hermione wiped her tears and looked at the letter in her hands but what if if my instincts tell me anything then i saying that they ll understand no matter what the cause because hermione said alice her face spreading to a smile they probably know more about you than you expect hermione giggled something she hasntdone in a long time so said alice let take the leap of faith and see where this letter takes us alright she placed a hand on her cousin and said because together we re unlimited hermione finished we re unlimited oh allie what would i do without you hermione wake up i dontwant to hermione whined groggily pulling the sheets over her you sleep like a log said harry voice hermione suddenly felt the sudden pull of her blanket bringing in a cold feeling that crawled on her body she curled up instantly and shivered hey hermione moaned squinting against the light that harry turned on give that b b back she yawned hermione sat up and reached for her blanket from harry before she could grab it harry lifted it away from hermione grasp harry she moaned loudly and with a groggy moan she fell on her pillows face first trying to get some sleep c mon kiwi said harry you told me to wake up early yesterday hermione felt harry fingers touch her toes wake up kiwi mmmmmmm hermione moaned pull my toes first she replied sleepily in a pleasurable sensation hermione felt the satisfying crack as harry pulled each of her toes stretching them from being cramped overnight okay that done so wake up said harry hermione finally sat up and rubbed her eyes letting out one last yawn she swung her legs off the bed and wore her fuzzy slippers breakfast is ready downstairs said harry standing beside her the bathroom is also free for you harry left her alone in the room leaving the door open from where she was sitting while letting the drowsiness ebb away the sound of people the crackling of cooking food must be eggs hermione thought footsteps and the distant running of water rang in her ears a minute later hermione sleepily trudged across the hallway with her clothes for the bathroom by the end of the short trek she found herself reaching for the brass doorknob to the bathroom when it opened to reveal alice newly bathed and dressed her hair all wet oh she said surprised to see the groggy hermione good morning not in the mood for any negativity hermione did not reply but gave way for alice to leave taking a hot shower was quicker than she anticipated since she found herself entering the dining room feeling sleepy to sit beside harry good morning hermione said aunt glinda who was still in her night gown your mother is still getting ready so i decided to cook breakfast here you go hermione noticed that aunt glinda was carrying a frying pan filled with sausages nodding to her aunt as a thank you hermione silently ate her breakfast adding toast and butter as she went you re quiet said harry squeezing butter between his toast bread i sleepy hermione replied in a dead like sort of way didntyour bath wake you up no hermione said calmly you want jam for your toast harry suggested hermione nodded staring into space as she chewed her sausages ignoring that harry was doing the honors to put jam on her toast hermione just relaxed and enjoyed the fact he was doing it for her you re still awake said aunt glinda to a person at the dining room entrance if the greenwich time meridian told us anything said kent voice sitting across hermione along with kelvin and matt oh drop it said aunt glinda here have some breakfast she slid a plate before kent it going to be a long way figures he said staring at his smiling bacon with two fried eggs for eyes done said harry putting her jam toast on her plate the bookworm absentmindedly thanked harry and began eating her toast good morning children said hermione father all dressed and ready for the trip as he entered the dining room fierro and i got the car ready so better hurry up with the breakfast dontrush them jacques said aunt glinda give them some time to gain their bearings yes dad please i just woke up where fierro glinda asked he loading the remaining luggage with mimi and dede said jacques going into the kitchen is there coffee yes there is said glinda turning to kent where is kline and krista upstairs kline probably awake by now as for krista i think she taking a shower kline taking a shower said hermione sleepily staring into space krista isn t yeah what she said kent nodded taking a bite of his sausage are you done with that harry aunt glinda asked politely gesturing to harry empty plate yes said harry nodding respectfully in return before aunt glinda took the plate from him without saying a word hermione left the dining room and dragged herself to the living room slouching on the couch when she arrived she never felt so sleepy her eyelids were heavy and her eyes itched of tiredness all she wanted was to sleep and get this road trip over with hey sleepy head said harry voice from behind leaning on the backrest of the couch hermione leaned her head backward to look at harry with her sleepy brown eyes i sleepy harry hermione moaned we all are he replied smiling down at her not you said hermione turning away to stare at the curtained windows which showed the dark morning you look wide awake well harry walked around the couch to sit beside her i haventslept yet excellent said hermione blinking you re really pissing me off and why is that harry cocked up an eyebrow curiously because you woke me from my beauty sleep while you still have the benefit to feel comfortably awake plus you lied to me about sleeping early she turned to harry with a mock glare i hate you harry laughed you can sleep in the car said harry i rather choose the bed hermione pointed out without giving a single thought hermione slowly rested her head on harry shoulder that nice said harry sarcastically like i not going to complain i sleepy harry said hermione harry underestimated her hermione really really sleepy alright he said serenely umm just sleep alright i ll wake you up when we leave in response she rubbed her cheek on his shoulder and closed her eyes feeling her eyelids muscles relax at the lack of work finally for all it worth she felt relaxed and liked the feeling of harry soft shoulder against her cheek a few moments later she sniffed the scent from harry hair which was basically the same shampoo she uses slowly her comfort getting over her she hugged harry arm lightly ignoring the fact that the arm belonged to him some minutes later kent hermione opened her eyes she wasntlying on harry shoulder anymore but on one of the throw pillows of the couch brushing a strand of hair from her face she looked up to see harry sitting beside her head gazing up at the staircase behind them who yelling alice walked down the staircase with an annoyed look what is it kent walked out of the dining room alice defiantly held up a pair of slippers that was filled with what looked like peanut butter kent winced explain she said sternly fine while you two werentlooking i ate in the bedroom he replied with a hint of defense but out of the klutz in me i got peanut butter all over your slippers your words cantbe any truer said alice do you know what you just did they re slippers only allie said kent turning to the dining room our universal solvent the water can let that thing out before you know it geez you fashionistas are crazy he added offhandedly before walking off with a sleepy stare hermione saw alice grouchy look it gave hermione some sort of feeble satisfaction it would ve been greater if she was wide awake he better pay for that alice spat going up the stairs again while the two of you werentlooking hermione asked sitting up oh hermione harry wheeled towards her you re awake er sorry what did he mean she yawned when he said the two of you werentlooking even if she was sleepy beyond reason the blush across harry face gave it all away er harry said scratching his head um he referring to me and alice to harry her face looked indifferent and her expression vague but behind that fa ade was a prickling annoyance what did you do she said in a lazy drone we just talked he smirked all night no wonder you haventslept that prickling annoyance began to throb harder than hermione intended why the hell was she feeling this way whenever harry interacts with alice what harry asked observing hermione expressionless face not knowing why she did it hermione suddenly punched harry on the shoulder so hard that harry yelped ouch hermione he cried holding on to his shoulder what was that for hermione did not answer but left the couch to do a final check on her stuff hermione found herself at the backseat behind the passenger seat of the family van leaning on her large soft pillow against the window staring at the bluish sky the dark sky looked very depressing i wish snow would fall it would make things look more pleasant the guilt of hitting harry enveloped her own being between the ten minutes she took her bag from her room to going into the car it not like she did it out of hating him i very sleepy that couldntbe a good reason her thoughts were as clear as day when she hit him but why why do i hurt him whenever he with her hermione looked to the left at the open door where she could see mimi and didi in cute little jackets helping their father pull some luggage into the other van realizing it she thought if harry would sit here with her it was probably a given if only she didntpunch him but what else does he have she cantimagine him sitting in the other van where the others will be staying i ll really really hit the roof if alice sits here with us distant calls from the house could be heard hermione couldnttell but they were probably about someone making sure they have everything ready hermonica you re here already she heard the kind voice of her father hermione looked in front and saw her father who just opened the door of the driver seat carrying a small plastic box filled with chocolate mallows this one for the trip said jacques noting hermione curious face i ll leave it here dontyou take one bite alright he smiled at her hermione smiled back before her father left she wished he could start the car though she always loved hearing the low humming of a vehicle while she sat inside it oh there you are it was aunt elphie handing her two sandwiches your mother prepared two for everyone so here you go she said hermione took them and looked at them rather vacantly what wrong honey aunt elphie asked catching her niece expression is something bothering you huh oh n nothing aunt elphie she forced a smile i just sleepy that all well there a road trip ahead of us aunt elpha replied you re right you can use the sleep you look very tired i ll be fine said hermione if you need anything tell your aunt elphie okay she said okay i ve got to give these to the other van see ya wrapping herself inside her blanket she brought it with her from her bedroom the bookworm wanted to take a last minute rest before everyone starts to leave well if only if she could rest the sound of a soft thud to her right made her turn to her surprise it was harry oh no he looks really grouchy his brows look like they were knotted together his face looking half annoyed and the way he scooted on the seat to sit beside her felt negative she always hated something like this whenever they share the same room but donttalk it was more painful than most things just say sorry to him look at harry with the corner of her eye hermione sighed how hard is it for her to just turn and apologize fear of rejection i guess i see you two are ready said monica from the outside of the door are your bags in at the same time hermione and harry nodded and gestured to the back of the van where their bags were we ll be leaving in three minutes said monica jacques is just locking all the doors oh harry make sure you move aside for alice yes aunt monica harry replied trying to hold in her chagrin hermione looked out the window snow started falling we better get moving said her mother looking up the snow might hinder our trip i doubt it would said the voice of alice carrying a yellow duffel bag that had a face on the side the face looked like one of those popular cartoons hermione saw the face was rather cute with black round eyes red cheeks curvy mouth and pointy ears since at this rate snow wouldntreach higher than our ankles before nine o clock i ll take that said hermione father appearing beside alice to take her bag thank you uncle alice said climbing into the vehicle hi harry hi allie said harry nervously shifting on his seat looks like we can continue where we left off she giggled if you know what i mean whatever that meant it made hermione sick what the hell y yeah harry nodded brushing the top of his lap dontyou have a pillow alice asked handing him one which she was holding here borrow mine n no harry pressed if i take yours you wonthave any not really she said showing a square yellow pillow on her other hand do you love yellow so much maybe but whenever i pick a color of something like a bag or a dress i always have the rest to share the same color strange isntit no wonder you re wearing a yellow jacket and yellow shoes said harry casually looking at her low top shoes they look er really nice hermione wanted to smack harry at the head but the entrance of her parents from the front stopped her alright children her mother said settling herself at the passenger seat sorry to keep you waiting it alright said harry politely it not a big deal you got the house keys honey jacques asked starting up the engine the rattling of the keys answered his question taking off the handbrake he turned to the children you got everything you need yes said the three fasten your seatbelts then he turned to the front off we go he said smiling to them from the rearview mirror please make this enjoyable than i intended it to be the sound of tires grazing on the tarmac rang in hermione ears and in one turn of the car they were now on the move her eyes opened from slumber where am i looking to the left she saw nothing but forested area zipping past her quickly before she could describe them the low humming of the car and the faint sound of tires sliding across the road below them told her she was still traveling feeling a throbbing pain from her neck she shifted her sleeping position and felt more uncomfortable her bottom was a bit sore for sitting too long and she wished she brought a different pillow looking to her right harry was wide awake staring at the front with an unreadable look even if she couldnttell she knew alice was asleep because if she were awake harry wouldntlook this calm where are we hermione finally said we re an hour away from there hermonica said her father just take another nap and you ll find yourself traipsing into the country home door before you know it taking his word for it hermione thought it would be better to sleep again shifting her head to a comfortable position she found it quite difficult to get a good angle for her to obtain that sweet spot for sleep i hate sleeping in the car trying to twist her neck it dawned to her that she didntlike sleeping with her head straight up if she could bend her neck lower she would be more comfortable stupid pillow hermione muttered under her breath punching it irritably she started to shift on her position until she felt someone watching her turning to look it was harry with a perplexed expression what she asked if you want he said unceremoniously you can use my shoulder ha hermione rolled her eyes thanks but no thanks harry you look uncomfortable said harry with a hint of sly in his voice i was just trying to help hermione didntwant to further an argument but decided to go back to finding a comfortable position after a few moments she now knew that it near impossible i cantget any good sleep around here ugh she groaned placing her pillow on her lap the car slowed down behind a truck which moved slower than anything hermione remembered tapping on her pillow she hugged it towards herself and tried to lie on it but to no avail it felt uncomfortable they began to pick up speed and for some reason she started to develop a small degree of car sickness her head started to ache are you alright dear her mother asked noticing hermione groans i fine mum she said rubbing her head i just need to rest that all i have aspirins over here if you need anything alright she said hermione sighed she felt sleepy all she wanted was to get to the country home and sleep all day just bite it hermione turning slowly to harry she saw him looking at the window to his right remembering his offer awhile ago she felt hesitant since it would feel awkward after what she did to him but looking back harry was always a forgiving person and he probably has strange ways to forgive someone shifting slowly on her position she sat back on her chair staring at harry and slowly she leaned forward and rested her head on his shoulder lightly as expected this position was much more comfortable her neck had that satisfying stretch and she felt she had more leg room than before i thought you didntwant hermione cut harry by wrapping her arms around his own like before she rubbed her cheek slightly on harry shoulder to settle in i changed my mind she said looking up at harry who had this amused expression on his face sorry for punching you she added quietly dontworry said harry sighing your punch was so weak i barely felt it hermione made a dry laugh and pressed her cheek against his shoulder affectionately feeling all the goodness of the world emanating in her once more now go to sleep you need it harry said will do her eyes closed to slumber we re here hermione woke up she felt something heavy on her head and saw she was still lying on harry shoulder wake up children said aunt monica the heavy feeling on her head lifted when harry woke up he must ve rested his head on hers during the trip finally harry said stretching his arms releasing hermione grasp hey allie wake up alice opened her eyes instantly and looked out the window groggily we re here already she asked scratching her eyes rather cutely that was fast you were asleep the whole time said aunt monica getting out of the car get your jackets ready it freezing out here shaking off the sleepiness hermione opened the door to her left and jumped out oh god she wasntjoking hermione shivered from head to toe while being all cold all over hermione saw the country home before her just like she said to harry the house stood two stories standing on the driveway before the garage hermione could see the porch filled with wood carved seats lanterns and the like it was decorated with christmas wreaths and garlands accompanied with colorful christmas lights cripes it cold said the distant voice of her cousin at the other side hey said harry climbing out of the car can you conjure up a blue bell flame we really need one remembering their first year use of this charm hermione thought it would be a good idea but doing so in front of her other relatives wouldntbe a good idea greetings called a voice from above everyone looked up and standing at the balcony was an old man wearing a black owl neck sweater he looked burly for an old person but gave a kind face his white short hair and matching beard matched the snow and even with that they could all tell he was smiling recognize him harry alice asked walking up next to him n no said harry looking up again should i alice giggled well a lot of people say he looks like sean connery yeah said kelvin appearing beside hermione because of that we tease him if he found the holy grail or defeated dr no matt added smirking hermione laughed in the inside at harry clueless expression secretly there were times she liked it when harry gets clueless over these muggle interest like movies thinking about it maybe she should let him watch some indiana jones some time i ll be right there hermione grandfather said disappearing from view hermione harry said jacques walking up to them with their bags these are yours correct thank you dad said hermione taking her bag from him a little later on hermione grand p re opened the front door for everyone to get in hermione hugged him with great joy as they all entered and through harry point of view he could see that her grandfather really really loves hermione it great to see you he exclaimed holding hermione by the shoulders it been awhile hermonica i miss you too grand p re said hermione happily jack said aunt monica kissing jack granger on the cheek the whole family started to greet jack granger that hermione had to move aside to let him reacquaint with the rest of the family he hasntseen in years oh my allie is that you she heard him say while watching she noticed harry at the threshold holding onto his bag looking out of place oh harry hermione went near him and said hey after they greet them i ll introduce you to him harry nervously smiled and nodded he going to be a bit tough hermione explained but he nice i can tell said harry so is this it hermione looked around and noticed he was checking on the interior the place was made of wood and looked like those mountain houses in skiing resorts wherever you look there were bear skin tapestries a rock made chimney a deer head mounted above the mantelpiece a living room which consist of leathery sofas to their left was the kitchen and dining room and beside the entrance to the dining room was the stairs to the second floor are very comfy isntit she said looking at harry with a sweet smile i love it he said give me the tour later okay sure why not hermione said oh wait my grandfather free c mon i ll introduce you to him grabbing him by the wrist hermione dragged harry towards her grandfather who just finished greeting mimi and didi grand p re hermione started releasing harry i want you to meet someone hermione looked at harry gave him a signal which was a nod looking nervously at her harry smiled slightly and walked up to her grandfather grandpa said hermione holding harry by the arm to give him confidence this is harry harry potter hermione grandfather observed harry with a sagely look after a few moments of nodding he finally spoke it a pleasure he smiled shaking harry hand you re right he is tall hermonica what harry looked at hermione i told him about you some years ago hermione said quickly i see he said erm pleasure to meet you too sir oh stop with the formalities jack said just call me grandpa jack or simply jack if you want y yes grandpa jack said harry awkwardly he a nice man hermione said jack smiling at him kindly welcome to my home he gestured around feel comfortable and enjoy your visit harry thank you harry bowed his head slightly alright he turned to the aunt monica the rooms are there as always he said settle in the next hour everyone began to move their stuff into the rooms above it was pretty much a tiring task in hermione opinion remembering that she wanted to sleep for the remainder of the day she quickly moved her stuff to the vacant guestroom at the end of the second floor corridor the second floor was structured in this way as one climbs up and reaches the first landing they see some sort of second floor living room accompanied with bookshelves and the like at one side a railing with a view of the lower floor is present and at the other a small set of three step stairs that leads to a corridor where the guestrooms were like the living room the whole place was decorated with things you can see in a mountain style home from antiques to contemporary the place was ridden with numerous things to look at portraits upon portraits to movie posters of old it was indeed an interesting place across the corridors of the guestrooms one could see pretty lamps held by fake antlers giving off a hotel like feel as they walk display tables with flower pots and some statuettes were placed at each end of the corridor intersecting the corridor of guestrooms was another corridor this time wider which led to the master bedroom nothing much to say about it other than it was where hermione grandfather slept directing our attention to the guestrooms hermione in particular each of the five guestrooms looked identical with two beds a couch and their own unique portrait overall they were comfortable rooms fit for relaxation while hermione passed the corridor to her room she was interrupted as two doors adjacent to each other opened revealing kline rushing from one side to the other those are my oreos krista complained chasing after her brother here take mine said kent from the inside of the room she came from hermione smiled at little krista and walked on until she reached the vacant room dropping her duffel bag on her bed and taking a seat on it she wondered if harry would consider being with her he ll probably choose to stay with alice ugh but i ll get over it need a roomie hermione turned and saw harry walking in the room dropping his own bag on the vacant bed harry hermione said i i umm what never mind she finally said keeping quiet let me guess he walked over to her and sat beside her on the bed you were wondering if i was going to be alice roommate right what are you implying something she asked suspiciously nothing said harry it just that with all your feelings towards alice i guess you were wondering if i was going to be with her or not hermione blushed it like he is he is implying something awkward why did i say something wrong harry asked catching her blush i it just that you sound like you re implying that i m hermione wouldntwant to bring it up but she had to give him the lowdown implying what you know she turned away to hide her red face that i m jealous or something it all out now hermione was blushing all over surprisingly harry was laughing why are you laughing hermione asked bewildered you have no idea how embarrassed that was sorry but it just silly he said i not implying that you are but then again you go ballistic when i with her i not hermione said you punched me more than once when i am with her harry pressed oh god oh god oh god oh god this is so awkward i it not like that hermione squeaked it not like what harry raised his eyebrows realizing it harry has been vague throughout is he implying what hermione thinks he implying i ll tell it to him straight i cantlet this go on any longer harry said hermione keeping a straight face i ll tell it to you straight whatever you re thinking regarding this so called jealousy let say i am alright harry smirked but she cut him that means nothing more than first degree jealousy more like what harry asked are you making me look like a fool fine hermione said sternly feeling a bit annoyed i jealous about you and alice but my jealousy is within the boundaries of my best friend isntspending time with me okay happy now had your laugh hermione turned away to hide her embarrassment why did she burst like that you re a wonderful girl you know that harry said hermione looked at him and giggled i sorry she muttered i just wanted to oh let it out hermione i just wanted to spend my whole christmas with you that all hermione admitted turning red i i know it sounds strange but there ever since it turned out that you re the only person from hogwarts that i can be with this christmas i thought that i should be with you hermione wanted to bury her face it was too much i know pathetic right hermione added staring at her hands i sound selfish now you re not harry spoke in fact i flattered to hear that my company really means a lot to you hermione gazed at harry but you know i really enjoy your family said harry i want to know them more and to be honest i get to know you a lot through them how hermione asked surprised they say a lot of nice things about you said harry things i know about and some things i dontknow about it amazing to hear them say this because that way it just makes me glad that you re my best friend hermione scratched her head feeling uncomfortable oh my hermione chuckled i i never knew at least i can feel more empathetic towards you now he chuckled and if you want to know this trip so far has been worth it thanks said hermione i wish ron was here it would ve been fun yeah i better send a letter to him harry noted i released hedwig last night i hoping she will come back soon can she tell where you are hedwig is smart she ll find me said harry hey let go downstairs i think your grandfather would want to ask me tons of questions i want to sleep said hermione scratching her eyes and yawning i really want to dontsay that said harry you have a whole night to do that really said hermione i couldntsleep well in the car if you say so said harry patting her lap before standing up i guess allie can show me everything nice try said hermione swinging her legs on the bed ready to take her shoes off but i need to get some shut eye a bemused expression flashed across harry face why before she knew it harry carried her from the bed holding her under her knees and by the back of her neck making her yelp hey i want to enjoy my vacation with you hermione said harry smirking and if you dontwant to i ll make you fine said hermione as they were walking towards the door just make sure you watch where you re ouch the sound of her head smacking right onto the threshold caused the back of her head to feel a brief sharp pain er said harry nervously or i can make you walk yeah that would work hermione admitted devoid of anything to say the two left the room it was an eventful day while hermione wanted to sleep badly she enjoyed her time in the country home before lunch she watched her cousins and harry play an intense snowball fight in the backyard beside the small frozen lake for some reason she didntmind when alice playfully dumped a snowball on harry head causing him to retaliate in a similar manner hey hermione yelled one of her cousins come and join us hermione smiled and politely declined the offer before a snowball smacked her clean in the face nice shot allie cheered kent hermione slowly turned a deathly glare at a giggling alice much to her chagrin harry was laughing as well feeling ticked off hermione stood up and scooped snow from the ground hey alice hermione yelled alice broke off from her laugh only to get large snowball right on the back of her head quickly enough alice took another scoop and threw back at hermione eventually everyone joined in the fight hermione sleep and irate away from her mind realized she was having fun well one of the fun factors was that she could throw snowballs at alice casually without getting anyone to wonder about it it was pretty memorable even when kelvin accidentally slipped on the snow and rolled around with difficulty his position got his brothers and sister to take a dog pile on him on the snow spotting alice innocently making her own snowball hermione made a big one a size of a melon to drop on her it wasntlong enough before kent smashed two snowballs at her causing her big one to fall over and mix with the snow you idiot hermione bellowed picking up a pile of snow to paste all over kent face take that harry shouted hitting hermione in the process h hey harry hermione cried trying to hit him with another snowball which he dodged with ease pretty much this was a great time for hermione that she almost forgot about her sleepiness though no doubt she would be extremely exhausted later the snowball fight officially ended when aunt elphie called all of them for lunch damn said matt we were nearly done with the snow fortress we ll continue with the building after lunch said kelvin who was behind the wall of snow hey guys break time feeling quite hungry hermione followed everyone to the house but only to hear someone make a loud yell hey heads up yelled kent throwing a snowball in a split second hermione shielded herself as snowball hit her kent hermione yelled angrily i said heads up kent laughed before she could get even with her cousin she heard alice behind her harry the snowball didnteven hit me turning on her heel she saw harry looking quite embarrassed feeling out of the loop she heard more of their conversation well er he said nervously i i thought it was going to hit you it was obvious and for unknown reasons it got hermione a bit annoyed he blocked her from harm way instead of me even if she knew the answer why harry likes alice it annoyed her that harry chose alice over her her confusion got the better of her that she scooped some snow turned into a snowball and right at the back of harry head before walking back into the country home you were excellent hermione said harry sitting beside her at dining table a little later on haha thanks said hermione mixing her oatmeal idly i really hit you a big one there then she added traitorous swine sorry nothing hermione smiled at harry and ate a spoonful of oatmeal everyone was busy talking and eating that hermione voice could easily be drowned under the sound with christmas music playing the background the area was very joyous after lunch some of the cousins wanted to continue the snowball fight while hermione felt tired to do so instead she sat on the couch in the comfortable living room which was near the warm fire you re not joining harry asked sitting beside her nope said hermione picking up a magazine from the magazine rack beside her i need a rest opening the magazine to read whatever article she could find she noticed harry staring into space following his gaze she noticed alice talking to aunt glinda through a wide window that divided the living room and the dining room the way alice was leaning on the window her hip in curved angle due to the way she stood she had this very impish intention not taking her eyes off the article she was reading she asked harry in a casual tone harry quit staring at my cousin ass what harry neck snapped at her aghast w why would you say that hermione chuckled mischievously oh you know why i ask she dropped the magazine to look at him you ve been dropping it too many times i i dontknow what you re talking about harry said instantly alice stopped her conversation with aunt glinda made her way to the staircase on mid walk she waved at harry before climbing up hermione rolled her eyes as she saw harry wave back typical boy said hermione no said harry quickly pausing for a moment he winced and finally said am i really that obvious more than ever said hermione grinning well what do you want to say harry fumbled with his fingers before saying okay you obviously know this but but oh spit it harry hermione said i like alice said harry blushing all over happy now there i said it i think i falling for alice yeah you kind of gave it away dear said hermione humorously to be frank said harry you seem to take this news really well what about it hermione asked i was expecting you to go ballistic or something harry said lowering his voice i dontknow if you re trying to do a good job in hiding it but i can pretty much tell that you and allie haventbeen quite in good terms for a while huh hermione made an awkward look then turned away that that really off key harry but you re very look answer me this does alice say anything negative about me n no but see we re perfectly in tune thank you very much she said impatiently harry did not question further but he shrugged i guess crossing her arms hermione turned to harry again noticing his bashfulness hermione impatient behavior ebbed away you really like her she finally asked yes said harry quietly erm i dontknow but i think even more than liking her you just met her three days ago anything else hermione asked sternly what made you like her well he said thoughtfully i i really like the way she talks she very charming that way with her voice well i cantdeny but alice always had a nice voice i see hermione said what else she can have a quirky side said harry i mean she has this little quirk where she hums random tunes and she can get a bit dilly dally if you know what i mean hermione did not answer which prompted harry to continue she also has this strange serenity about her from the way she just sits there and read or talk about what she knows it amazing to listen to what she says hermione oh she replied simply and another thing i like about her is well how she very smart kind and has a great love of getting to learn things in life this got hermione to burst out laughing affronted at this harry brows furrowed what with you oh harry hermione looked at him do you have any idea how crazy you sound like uh i dontknow but i guess i do he said with uncertainty harry harry said hermione you do realize that you re falling for alice because of her persona right that basically the point said harry confused what are you getting at hermione gestured to herself forcing harry face to dawn in realization oh very funny said harry chuckling you re saying i like alice because she like you useless fact hermione said more than once have we been mistaken for twin sisters by many so if we apply some deduction here hmmmm let see she rubbed her chin thoughtfully oh look alice is just like me harry blushed i just kidding harry said hermione patting him on the shoulder i didntmean to freak you out n no said harry it just that er he shook his head anyway i want to ask you something fire away er is it okay if you um give this to alice harry pulled something out of his pocket and handed her a silver necklace oh my god w where did you get that hermione said croakily it allie s said harry she showed it to me yesterday the metal looked aged and all she told me it was one of her most prized possessions and that it has seen better days i see hermione slowly took it from harry anyway she left it with me by accident and before i could return it i thought i could use some magic to make it look shiny again he grinned i thought she might like it i would give it to her but i you re shy right hermione asked okay give it here you coward chuckling harry handed her the necklace which hermione proceeded to examine it with concentration it been years since she saw this necklace harry did a good job though since it looked exactly as shiny as she remembered it what wrong harry asked it looks like you ve seen a ghost n nothing she said i just thought i d give it a closer look erm you can count on me you will harry said happily thanks hermione suddenly harry leaned forward and kissed hermione on the cheek a large force hit hermione like a heavy snowball harry called kent walking down the staircase we re getting ready for the next brawl it show time okay said harry turning to hermione thanks again kiwi i ll see you later he jerked his head backward i got a snowball fight to attend while watching harry leave the living room through the sliding doors that led to the backyard hermione inadvertently reached for her kissed cheek sighed and slowly smiled i wontdeny it but that was nice the next day came faster than hermione expected waking up she saw that it was almost eleven in the morning dammit i overslept again wiggling out of bed she got ready for the day and walked down to the kitchen where her grandfather was reading a newspaper herrmonica he said lovingly eyeing her fondly you re finally awake he nodded towards her brunch i saved you some food thank you grand p re hermione said kissing her grandfather on the cheek before sitting down do a barrel roll said a voice from the living room what that hermione asked looking out the boys are playing that nintendo thing said her grandfather drinking his coffee while reading scratch one bogey ignoring the distant sounds of what seemed to be laser fire and explosions hermione helped herself to her brunch where are my parents hermione asked your parents went to the nearby shopping mall said jack same as allie parents and aunt glinda i guess they re getting your christmas presents so it just you and the kids hermione asked kids jack turned an amused face to her excuse me but i think i have two ladies a gentleman and kids in this house with me hermione giggled i guess i one of the ladies jack granger heartily laughed i guess you are hermonica now finish your food before it gets cold hey einstein i on your side said the voice from the game in the living room hermione finished her breakfast place her plate in the sink and left for the living room to see aunt glinda children watching matt play some sort of game in the television what that hermione asked watching from the back of the couch to see the tv screen filled with a flying spaceship shooting other ships oh good morning hermione said kent anyway mattt playing star fox 64 you re doing it wrong said kline as matt did some sort of wrong move i see said hermione er where harry right here hermione harry said from below sitting on the couch hermione was behind at oh she gasped sorry i i didntsee you it okay said harry smirking what do you need i need to talk with you she said and nodded to a corner okay said harry following hermione away from the boys what is it i wanted to know where alice is said hermione i going to give it to her now she went out with the others harry replied last minute decision if you ask me i see said hermione i guess i ll give it later on yeah said harry where the necklace here looking up to show it around her neck dontfreak out that i wearing it harry i not rusting it or something i not harry replied why would you tell me not to because she dropped her head to a normal level this necklace used to belong to someone i knew really harry said his curiosity rising who might that be it a secret said hermione apologetically sorry but that all you will get from me fair enough said harry but i just dontget it hermione said taking the necklace from her neck to put in her pocket you can talk to her normally and that but cantgive her something like a gift it strange guess what said harry i have my tongue tied all the time i mean i really get worried that i might sound like a freak or something just imagine she me and maybe it will work out well hermione added spitefully sorry i said i wanted some coffee said hermione do you want some i make great coffee it wasntthat much of an eventful day as yesterday hermione spent the whole noon in the country home with harry by watching her cousins play with their video game nintendo thing she remained quiet on her task the whole day long will she even talk to me the idea was beyond stupid hermione thought harry knows well that she and alice are not in good terms and yet he telling her to do this what gives it like he trying to make me be friends with her again ugh after noontime passed hermione decided to read a book to pass the time since she had nothing better to do she was getting bored seeing her cousins shoot each other too many times in some game based on a james bond flick she sat herself down on a couch at the second floor landing where she could have some peace and quiet being the bookworm she is she instantly finished the first chapter of the book she was reading watership down in a pinch it wasnttoo long before the rest of her family arrived at home around dusk around that time hermione was nearly done with the book that she forgot that her grandfather was just next to her decorating the walls with additional christmas baubles we re home said aunt monica voice down below hermione stood up and looked down from the railing view waving at her mother silently she spotted alice entering through the door carrying a lot of bags just hand it over to her you promised harry they re home i see said her grandfather standing beside her dad called hermione father who was referring to her grand p re i got the lights here oh thank you he said and walked down the staircase leaving hermione alone why was she hesitant anyway it not like she was going to run and punch her in the face or anything all she has to do is walk up to her give her the necklace tell her it from harry and make her way it not so hard hermione but why was she afraid to talk to her hermione has always been adamant towards alice so why was she feeling this sudden nervousness to go up to her cousin harry she heard alice voice below hermione looked below and saw alice dropping the bags she was carrying as harry walked up to her he looked nervous but somewhat stable you re seventeen harry grow a pair the bookworm silently observed the two and saw alice pull out a red owl neck sweater from one of the shopping bags hermione then saw alice playfully held it up on harry torso as if she was showing him it fitted him the familiar prickling feeling happened as hermione saw her cousin pull out a bonnet from the bags to put it on harry harry looked timid but he seemed to enjoy it for some reason hermione started to get annoyed and last but not the least said alice taking out a very nice scarf then wrapping it around harry neck ta dah it got hermione more annoyed when she saw alice fix the scarf around harry as he stood there much better she heard alice say awww you look so cute she pinched his nose affectionately the bookworm suddenly gripped the railing firmly her eyes darted towards her gripped hand and briskly dropped it to her side okay what was that just now taking a step backward hermione held on her forehead and took a deep breathe did did i no way she did not just feel a little jealous over there did she looking away with her arms crossed she pondered a moment then looked below at the two you really donthave to buy that much for me allie said harry why mom reckoned i d buy something for my new friend harry said alice in a bubbly way you dontlike it she pouted i i do i do said harry smirking thanks you re so sweet harry said alice leaning forward to hug him aww you re soft with the clothes heehee oh for the love of hermione jaw dropped and turned away raking her brown hair while taking small breaths she tried to shake off the feeling of how she reacted you re thinking too much probably i mean it just a hug right nothing can get out of it but why in merlin name did she suddenly feel this intensity within her soul this isntthe first time either as she felt those odd prickles whenever alice pulls a nice nice to harry an emotional battle ensued in her mind it a natural feeling to have someone you dontlike interact with your best friend i dontthink you re being honest here really i telling you she a bad seed but she nice to harry and harry can see alice niceness but i dontwant him to fall for her you cantdo anything about it and why do you even care because he my best friend you re just jealous no i just hate her for what that she with your boy toy harry noooo no no snap out of it hermione she slapped smacked her temples with both her palms you are not jealous hermione began to rap on her head firmly to the point it started to hurt she stopped in the middle of doing so when she heard footsteps from the staircase someone was climbing up it was harry hermione he approached to her just wanted to remind you about her necklace for the first time in her life hermione looked at harry in his new red sweater with a different kind of way she looked at the fabric and liked the way it melded with his structure nice sweater she said her brows knitted in confusion before looking up you look dashing yeah harry grinned allie gave it to me hermione cantdeny that alice had the eye for knowing what looks good on someone anyway when are you going to give it to her he said casually umm she looked at her side her mind feeling confused before clicking back into place after dinner yeah after dinner thanks hermione said harry placing a hand on her shoulder feeling very awkward at the moment hermione looked at harry with that same confused look on her face what the bloody hell am i feeling are you okay this is the second time you look like you re seeing a ghost kiwi said harry i fine harry said hermione shaking her head i guess i just having a christmas daze that all haha i get that too said harry hey i have to go check on something downstairs see you at dinner leaving hermione alone at the landing the bookworm sank onto the couch and covered her face with her hands i am so confused during dinner hermione learned that tonight her parents her uncles and aunts would go check a certain recreational spot a few minutes from here they offered her to join but hermione wanted to do was find time to rest some of her cousins however decided to check this place out as kent pointed out he could use a little r and r for curiosity sake i guess it just us then jack said to hermione i ve been to that place many times i rather that others see the place without my guidance do you want to go allie aunt monica asked i tired from all the shopping aunt mon mon alice replied politely i would love to go but i think i need a good nap i feel sleepy anyway how about you harry jacques asked taking in a slice of ham umm harry shot a look at hermione for advice even if she tired of it she quite grateful that harry still turns to her for help in times like this well asked jacques erm i haventreally thought about it said harry i was planning to erm i think harry is saying that he wants to be here said kent nodding thoughtfully you know be with allie and kiwi the usual boy thing hermione and alice instantly shot daggers at kent who whistled innocently as he drank his hot chocolate well its fine said aunt glinda i mean we re just going to be there for a while anyway later on hermione immediately finished dinner before anyone else and went upstairs to take a nice warm bath it was relaxing and it took out all her frustrations she has got during the course of the day so relaxing hermione did not think of anything but to sit in this bathtub all warm and relaxed her muscles which were tensed through the cold have softened and without even worrying a thing she felt at peace a little later on she got out and dressed up into something comfortable for the night she met harry by the foot of the stairs below what took you you ve been there so long that your parents and the rest already left i had to take a bath she said where alice she at the lake said harry walking and stuff why hermione pulled out the necklace from her pocket and showed it to harry he smirked you re really going to do this harry asked yeah said hermione it not like i going to do anything bad hermione passed harry towards the sliding doors into the backyard but was stopped by harry when he grabbed her by the arm what she asked defensively dontdo anything stupid said harry humorously chuckling hermione made a dry laugh i won t trust me she opened the door into the cold outdoors the place was absolutely beautiful tonight beyond the misty air hermione could make out the small lampposts that circled around the lake a gazebo a few meters from here could be see and even if it wasnttoo dark hermione could tell that it was lit with dim christmas lights as the christmas air massaged her face gently she squinted into the horizon and saw a familiar figure trudging slowly through the snow by the frozen lake bank feeling some hesitation hermione walked down the porch and onto the snow briefly remembering the snowball fight that occurred here yesterday god it really cold making an effort to walk on the snow hermione called out for her cousin when she was a couple of meters away from her alice hermione finally spoke her voice sounding stern than she intended it to be surprised alice squeaked and turned to hermione immediately dontscare me like that she said then after registering that it was hermione her face fell oh it you there was an awkward silence between the two the snowy winds whispered to them as time passed how long will they keep at it this way what do you want alice asked crossing her arms to warm her hands um said hermione reaching for her pocket to pull out the necklace i believe this is yours alice gasped hey i ve been looking for that she walked closer to examine it where did you find it harry gave it to me said hermione briskly you accidentally left it with him and he thought he could give it a shine oh said alice erm can i have it back sure said hermione handing it to her cousin by dropping it on alice palm here you go hermione saw alice look at the necklace with a certain meaningful look she found it peculiar though it kinda takes you back doesntit alice said enigmatically her eyes on hermione hermione did not answer but knew what alice meant yeah hermione said dismissively look i ve got to go back just dontmake anything more complicated than it already is hermione thank you by the way said alice no thank harry said hermione plainly he told me to give it to you for some reason hermione wanted to get out of there as possible t then can you tell him alice asked before hermione cut her you know i think it better if you just tell him yourself said hermione sharply turning her back on alice finally now i can hermione just ignore her hermione cantyou see i need to do something alice hermione asked loudly walking her way up is it really this hard to talk to you these days alice yelled from behind hermione instantly wheeled around alice to meet her annoyed face what hermione spat i mean alice continued heatedly i just want to at least talk to you for once hermione oh so now you want to talk me hermione said darkly what took you realized how wrong you felt or are you just looking for me to gloat it not like that said alice angrily alright fine but if you listen to me why would i listen to you hermione suddenly blurted out after when you did the same to me years ago alice did not reply but remained on her ground now please said hermione trying to ease her anger i have to do something i did my job she looked at the necklace and now you have your necklace back hermione what hermione spun around this time alice was already near her this was probably the first time in years she been this close to her cousin the two locked their gaze at each other for a length of time strangely alice was looking rather determined but remorseful do you have any idea alice spoke have you ever wondered how hard it been for me these days are you trying to make a point i saying is that alice looked away and back at hermione everything that we ve said or done to each other in the past few days i know we didntmean any of it what are you seriously asking for forgiveness for all these years i donthave time for this hermione said in a tone of total conclusion hermione alice said in a groan please listen to me alice hermione spat making alice jump listen to me listen to me and make sure it gets into your brain of yours if you re looking for forgiveness from me then dontexpect it to come any sooner because after what you did after what i ve done for you four years ago i mean the way you shunned me do you think i got over that alice did not reply but looked very hurt and guilty if you re looking for redemption alice said hermione coldly look someplace else give me some space alright without a word hermione turned on her heel but only to catch alice next words to be honest she said her voice filled with spite johnny would probably ask some forgiveness too if he were here at the sound of john name hermione snapped wheeling around she yelled dontyou dare smack in a fraction of a second her fist slammed right on alice lip the force was severe for the young cousin that with a high yelp that escaped from her lips she fell on her bottom clutching on where she was punched as she fell ow she cried tears falling down from her eyes it finally sunk in hermione skin she just punched alice o oh my god hermione gasped shocked at what she just did after she saw alice wince in pain the two shared eye contact from hermione shocked brown eyes to alice cerulean blue watery ones hermione saw it there wasnta hint of pure hatred or anger but of sadness and hurt hermione even noted how she gave alice one hell of a bloody lip k kiwi alice cried in a quiet sob almost helpless at the sound of alice calling her the name that connected the two it reminded her of a person she remembered in the past a certain loving cousin who she cared so much crying out for someone she saw as a sister when in a certain pinch in life a allie hermione said in a shocked whisper hermione bellowed a voice it was harry from where hermione was standing harry gave a look of extreme shock it did not look pretty h harry hermione stuttered i can explain before she knew it alice stood on her feet and walked pass hermione in a fast walk towards someplace else leaving harry and hermione alone hermione could ve sworn she heard sobs from alice as she passed by turning to face harry hermione winced her teeth clenched in guilt h harry she said i cantexplain i swear what did you do he said loudly why did you do that his voice had a force of a roaring lion godric gryffindor would ve been proud hermione thought okay harry i think we can explain this without the use of yelling oh sure lets not use yelling but i think from what i ve seen hurting someone counts eh harry spat harry hermione retorted angrily i know what i did but can you at least listen to me i saw what i saw hermione said harry you punched alice for what reason d did you not see the rest of our conversation she said hysterically in fact i didn t said harry but i dontunderstand why you would do such a thing hermione that not likeyou hey hermione ranted back do you have any idea what going on between alice and i i dontknow said harry and even so even if i have no idea punching alice isntthe right thing i know you hate her hermione you make it damn obvious that you do i thought it was some kind of mutual hate love thing between cousins but i never in my life would i see you punch her how about you hermione retorted back walking up to him in rage you and dudley have something like that hey harry pointed at her there a fine line between that dontcross it hermione couldntbelieve it she was actually having a row with harry this cantbe happening this could ruin everything i know my limits harry hermione said but you cantunderstand what going on between me and alice okay harry just stared at her adamantly which prompted hermione to continue i know what i did was stupid and not the best thing i ve done ever but do you have a clue why i ve had this animosity towards her for the past few years do you harry did not reply hermione just blinked sadly at him a tear trickling down her cheek i just cantbelieve you actually hurt her said harry i mean she your cousin she hates me too said hermione defiantly trying to hold back her tears y you can see that harry but even if she does hate you said harry she told me a day ago when i asked out of curiosity that even if the two of you showed hostility towards each other alice would never physically hurt you in such way hermione found this surprising but this just tightened her guilt even more and you know harry continued as much as i your best friend i canthelp but be on allie side on this one i i didntmean to harry hermione pleaded you know that look said harry holding up a hand save it wha i said save it harry bluntly pressed he looked really annoyed i need to see if alice is okay no no dontgive me the cold shoulder again please harry hermione pleaded her eyes welling up now dontdo this it was like four years ago when a certain friendship in her life was severed due to misunderstandings and basically being in the wrong place and at the wrong time after one last look at hermione harry trudged on the snow following the footsteps of alice that led towards the gazebo a few meters from here now that she noticed it she could see alice being inside it h harry hermione stuttered trying to follow him dontleave me hermione knelt down on the snow as a traumatizing emotion overwhelmed her in tenfold how the painful memories damaged her own soul it was enough to make her die on the spot if it were a deadly weapon harry it was too late harry was too far away now dontleave me i dontwant this to happen again not like johnny the christmas wind silently whispered in her ear to get up which she did it was no use for her if she kept on crying like this she has to be strong that what her grandmother told her before trying to collect herself hermione had nothing to do but stand up and leave for the country home summer of 1991 look what johnny gave me kiwi alice said showing hermione a necklace wow hermione looked at the necklace with awe it looks expensive i know right said alice giggling he so nice to me kiwi hermione smiled broadly i think i know who developing a crush said hermione in a singsong voice oh you know it said alice jokily by the way how are you and this hogwarts thing well it worked out said hermione thanks to that ministry representative who visited here the other day mr desmond alice asked the guy we met in the park yeah said hermione thanks to him he has answered all of my questions i just cantbelieve that you re a witch hermione said alice in wonder i mean it sounds cool and all but remember that you have to keep this a secret i know said hermione in disappointment at least mr desmond was nice enough to trust you into knowing this yes said alice giggling i did not believe he could do magic but i was surprised he actually did so without the use of a top hat i hope you can do things like that kiwi i doubt i ll make a good impression in this hogwarts thing allie hermione said but i ll do my best i have to prove that i more than just a muggle born yes said alice feeling great for her cousin positive thinking that the spirit kiwi one thing that bothering me though said hermione sitting on the couch they were in the living room by the way how about johnny mr desmond said that i canttell anyone about this alice didntreally have a definite answer but all she suggested was i sorry kiwi but i guess it those things that we have to live with even if it pains me i guess we must keep this secrecy really good then said hermione i dontwant johnny to walk in on me pulling a rabbit out of my hat by accident i just wished he knew about it it would be so much fun to play magic around in the summer alice pointed out mr desmond said i cantuse magic until i seventeen remember oh yeah alice said i can wait that long anyway girls lunchtime called hermione mother from the kitchen ooh said hermione i can smell my mum omelet i love that alice clapped happily on her seat c mon kiwi alright hold on let me just adjust your chair hermione said in a short instant hermione helped alice adjust her wheelchair a contraption that has helped moved around for the past few years due to her being a paraplegic carefully pushing her cousin towards the dining room hermione and alice discussed what they would do for the rest of the day after they finished lunch for the past few moments we ve seen these girls during their summer alice was always described to be on her seat in effect it because of this that hermione has always shown an over protectiveness over her cousin due to her status as a paraplegic in life but as life goes on simple miracles happen between these two that directly affect their future whether it may be a good future or not for them the uncertainties of these future events will undoubtedly unfold for these two little girls for the betterment of each other company i cantbelieve you hermione i just can t harry could not let it sink in that hermione would do such a thing he was so angry at her actions that he thought it justifiable that he should learn her lesson but then again it made him feel bad about it he knew hermione disliked being ignored by her best friend but this was for the best the sobs of alice began to grow louder as he neared the gazebo he continued his trek until he finally stood right in front of the entrance sitting at one side alone hurt and sad was a crying alice her face was buried under her arms sobbing about things harry would probably never understand are you alright harry asked alice shot a look and hiccupped in surprise h harry she said in a croaky voice i i did not see you harry sat beside alice who scooted away from him obviously embarrassed of her bloodied lip i cantbelieve she hit me harry alice said what hermione she sniffed i never knew she d be capable of that harry frowned sadly at her i ve known hermione for years now he said i know it might not help but i know she did not mean it alice hiccupped so can you tell me what going on between the two of you harry asked casually maybe that way i can understand what going on between the two of you oh said alice wiping her tears with her sleeve i dontthink it a really good story it will bore you and its very very personal alice turned to harry and it was at this moment harry smiled kindly at her alice slightly blushed and touched her lip she winced at the blood and tried to wipe off any residue from the wound feeling some pity for her harry lowered alice hand to look at her bleeding lip what she asked her voice faltering you re beautiful said harry stroking her hair not even a bleeding lip can prevent that fact alice flushed a deep shade of pink everything was quiet between the two except for the whistling breeze and the distant christmas music coming from the inside harry smiled at alice features as they were illuminated by the golden christmas lights she looked angelic t thank you alice gasped softly her eyes twinkling i i really donthave anything to whatever alice wanted to say harry will never know for he leaned towards her and kissed her on the lips they parted away and harry grinned at the shock on alice face mistletoe harry pointed upwards chuckling nervously alice giggled and bit her lip you know we really dontneed that parasite plant to do that parasite harry looked up at it y yeah alice bowed her head i i read it on an encyclopedia somewhere they beamed at each other once more so why dontwe pretend that it not there harry suggested i think i d like that alice smiled sweetly and yet again the two leaned towards each other and kissed passionately in the gazebo as the christmas air gave nothing short of a romantic feel that dwelled in the night from a distance away from the gazebo hermione granger saw this romantic moment unfold before her right when she was about to enter the country home hermione jaw dropped slightly she looked across the backyard where she saw the two of them kissing passionately under the gazebo a sudden sadness filled her heart as the memories of the yesteryears flashed before her eyes hermione couldntthink right but as her memory ran its course it finally dawned to her that everything that led to this point all began with a miracle and a feeling some sort of feeling that was both terrible and wonderful what is this feeling so sudden and new she felt the moment she laid eyes on them my pulse is rushing my head is reeling my face is flushing what is this feeling it was perfect as a flame does it have a name hermione thought yes as her heart pounded her heart grew three sizes hermione breathed heavily as a chill shivered down her spine as if she was experiencing some nauseating effect and for once in her life hermione confirmed the feelings that were hidden deep within her frequent denials she wasntjust a jealous girl who kept on feeling irked whenever her best friend was in the company of a girl no because as it turned out she was in the place where she wished that she was in alice shoes kissing the boy under that old christmas decorated gazebo to be concluded with hermione granger part v vi broken hermione smiled in satisfactory as she finished her transfiguration essay she reread the sentences if there were any typos or errors any fact and figures she missed out but she put the parchment down taking a deep sigh knowing that she finished it wow not just i finished my essay i learned a lot about broomsticks she said to herself the said essay was about turning a broomstick into any item the person sees fit a very advance type of transfiguration since broomsticks are known to have lots of enchantments to block off almost any spell now to part two of the essay said hermione taking a new roll of parchment and started spreading it across the table after she did that she frowned at the blank space on the paper professor mcgonagall told the class the essay will be divided into two parts one was for a written explanation and two a sketch of the spell taking into effect hermione didnthave a problem with part two of the essay the only problem was that she wasnta very good drawer maybe if i could use some thing to copy on hermione said desperately looking around the common room she needed an item a book is good enough and a broomstick she wanted her drawing to be accurate as possible even if her drawing abilities are anything but stellar hermione drew the book first the lines are a bit uneven but that would do then she tried to make a drawing that looked like a book crossed with a broomstick the last drawing was supposed to be a broomstick well here goes she said but something in her mind stopped her from drawing she had an idea it was good but would he mind hermione looked up at the staircase where the boy dormitories harry and ron were not available at the moment and maybe just maybe if she can borrow harry firebolt she knew very well where he would keep his broomstick ron stores it in the broom cupboard at the pitch harry probably wontmind said hermione standing up he my best friend after all she walked up the staircase and entered the dormitory of harry it was deserted since everyone was at the grounds enjoying the last day of the easter holidays hermione walked to harry bed and she kicked harry trunk open and there laid the amazing firebolt of her best friend easy there she said holding the firebolt cautiously that does it hermione carried the firebolt out of the dormitory she went down to the common room but her foot caught the hem of her robes making her roll down the staircase crack ouch she squealed as she held her back in pain when she landed on the landing below my back she was able to get up on her feet still wincing on the aftershock of her fall she brushed her robes and looked around wondering where the cracking noise came from she wheeled around to see something split into two uh oh said hermione with a shocked face harry firebolt was split into two hermione panicked she looked around to see if there were any witnesses good thing it was sunday everyone was out and it was only her in the common room since she was doing her studies good job brainiac she said to herself you sat on your best friends broomstick then she pulled her bushy brown her downwards with her hands harry going to kill me she picked up the tail and the head she looked at them helplessly why me she yelled in the quiet empty common room i know harry must never know she nodded frantically yet hysterically i ll just hide it and but wait she looked around where will i hide it then the portrait swung open as harry and ron climbed inside this made hermione panic than ever before she quickly put the two pieces behind her back obstructing it from view woo said ron what a day did you see malfoy face when i threw that mudball at him yeah said harry hermione wished she was invisible right now i should have gotten the invisibility cloak she thought but the need of the cloak disappeared when she thought that she might tear it into pieces hermione ron said joyfully hermione chuckled nervously as she waved at them then she realized that she was waving at them with the handle of the firebolt she quickly put her hands behind her before ron or harry could notice how your studying going harry asked walking up to her fine hermione said nervously as she started walking backwards her hands behind her back really great in fact i was just on my way out to join you but now she saw the tail of the broomstick sticking out beside her she moved her hands a bit and hid it from view you re here i think i ll go to the library she laughed hermione are you okay harry asked walking to her hermione felt her back touched the wall when she nodded i fine she said shakily n never better harry was a few feet from her he looked at her midriff for a while and said er why do you have your hands behind your back hermione gave him a nervous smile oh this she said i i was just she blinked too much i was just scratching my back hermione sighed when harry nodded and said i see anyway ron and i were just going to play chess before lunch want to watch us hermione still smiling shook her head vigorously said no thank you okay said harry anyway said ron i ll just get the chessboard you do that said harry i ll just set up the table hermione gave harry an alarming look er why dontyou go up with ron why would i do that yeah why would harry do that ron said hermione gave them a toothy nervous smile er uh maybe he needs to check something i think she said then harry gave out a face of realization you know what you re right he said looking at ron c mon ron i just remembered that i was going to do my daily check up on my firebolt harry and ron went up the boy dormitory leaving hermione with horrified look stupid she cried out loud when the boys were out of earshot hermione ran to her bag placed the remains of harry broom inside carried it and dashed out to the portrait hole feeling bad as ever before hermione rushed down to the great hall and saw that everyone was getting ready for lunch she sat down and placed the bag containing the firebolt under the table then she sat down and started eating quickly the last thing she wanted now was harry marching to her and asking if she seen his broomstick it happened harry came marching into the great hall looking disgruntled and angry hermione quickened her eating but before she could grab her bag and leave harry and ron sat down with her harry was beside her while ron was across the table by the looks of it she was able to catch what they were talking about only a gryffindor must ve gotten in said ron agitatedly i know ron said harry angrily i going to get the bottom of this the culprit isntthat far hermione bit her lower lip i know said ron excitedly let make an investigation you know like that muggle detective what his name sherlock holmes said harry yeah him anyway we should find the suspects and when we do we can give him some questions ron continued then will just squeeze it out of them or maybe we should ask witnesses first then look for the suspects said harry or we could track the bloke down and beat him or her up to a bloody pulp said ron punching his palm hermione started breathing heavily she didntwant to look guilty ron we donthave to be that cruel then he turned to hermione maybe we can ask her first he said to ron hermione bit her lower lip me she asked squeakily harry and ron gave her a peculiar look you sound like you have a guilty conscience ron teased smirking me guilty she made a small giggle i would never break your boomstick break ron and harry said suspiciously i i m mean steal yeah steal your broomstick hermione said quickly anyway said harry you were in the common room the whole time right hermione nodded quickly did you see anyone climb up to the boy dormitories harry asked seriously hermione held the edge of the table and shook her head i was transfixed to my studying she said quietly i see said harry turning to his plate harry said ron frowning believe me when i say this you have to thoroughly search the witnesses if you want answer so he turned to hermione are you sure you were studying hermione gulped i was she said forcing a smile twenty four seven she gave a nervous laugh are you sure ron asked giving her a suspicious look yes i think you re hiding something no i think you are no hermione bang the table with her to fist it made ron jump and their area quiet ron i had nothing to do with it she shouted with panic in her voice so dontgo accusing me for something i didntdo she winced i sorry said ron just calm down i was just playing with you i know but please be more careful next time okay okay said ron looking down on his food hermione nodded grabbed the bag and started leaving the great hall dontworry hermione ron called after her we ll find the culprit hermione started walking fast she wanted to shout then ron called the truth will be revealed hermione dontworry when she left the great hall hermione started crying she was not anymore panicking she was afraid harry might get angry with her after wiping her tears hermione continued to walk down to the library till she broke of to a run hermione ran into the library she went into the secluded parts of the book filled room she placed the bag on the table and sat on a chair this is so bad she said and looked up i so sorry harry she covered her face and started crying then she looked up how stupid of her hermione stood up and turned her bag upside down and the broomstick remains fell on the table surface hermione took out her wand and pointed it at the broken broomstick reparo nothing happened hermione looked at the firebolt it could be repaired harry nimbus couldntbe fixed since it was broken into pieces the firebolt however was just split into two hermione could just fix it with a repair charm but why isntit working reparo the broom didntfix itself then she remembered that broomsticks cantbe repaired by a simple repair charm the spell must be advanced and there is only one way to learn it from a book hermione tore into every book she could fine charms spells anything after searching everywhere hermione sat miserably on the table and looked at the firebolt she sighed and put it inside her bag before she could make a good cry someone appeared behind the bookshelf hermione it was ginny oh ginny said hermione hi hey can i talk to you about something ginny nodded and walked to her well what is it she asked hermione sighed well said hermione biting her lower i it has something to do with harry his broom yeah i know said ginny and a serious look appeared on her face it bad isn t he was furious hermione gulped she didntknow where this was going he swore he gonna find the bloke who stole his broom i know he sounds a bit negative but if i lost my broomstick then i would she looked around and saw hermione bag do you have parchment paper hermione quickly gave her a piece of parchment paper thanks she said taking it anyway if someone stole my broomstick then i would she tore the parchment paper in half find the guy in fourths grab him in eights and kick the lights out of em hermione saw as ginny put the pieces in her pocket anyway is that what you want to say without further ado hermione grabbed her bag and ran out of the library as quick as possible great just great now i a marked woman hermione didntknow where she was going she turned to a corner and bumped into someone ouch hermione cried as she landed on her bum she looked up and froze when she saw the person she bumped was harry hermione he said surprisingly sorry i didntsee you he held up a hand it my fault actually she took his hand as he heaved her up there was a slight pause then well said hermione how your search harry frowned and sighed nope but i have a hunch who got it hermione smiled nervously who i think it was dean i remembered having an argument with him last month but i dontthink he would have done something this big hermione nodded harry i think i need to go okay see you around hermione sighed in relief as she walked pass him she was going back to her dormitory to well she doesnteven know what to do either try to find a way to undo what she did or cry hey hermione harry called after her you forgot your bag hermione froze on the spot and turned to harry he was holding her bag which was still open she gave out a horrified look and sprinted to him hermione harry said wondering why she was running to him hermione ran and tackled harry right on the torso making him and her fall on the ground argh hermione what was that for harry shouted hermione ignored him she took the bag and ran away she didntknow how many floors climbed she just ran and ran she didntwant harry to know she was afraid that harry might get angry with her she was the reason why harry temporarily lost his firebolt during third year but what if he found out she was the reason he lost his firebolt again hermione shook her head and stopped to a halt at a lone corridor she pressed her back on the wall and lowered herself to a sitting position i sorry harry she mumbled through her heavy breathing why was she afraid she knows she afraid of harry getting angry at her but why would she be afraid of tell the truth to harry harry her best friend would he understand he probably might learn a lesson that friendship is more important than broomsticks ms granger hermione looked up and saw dumbledore looking down at her professor she said standing up and realized she was crying so she wiped her eyes i didntsee you there it okay he said smiling i was just wondering why werentyou out in the grounds enjoying the last day of the holidays actually i in a small dilemma right now said hermione looking down what sort of dilemma it has something to do with afraid of telling the truth dumbledore smiled and said i canthelp you in your little problem ms granger but i can give you one friendly advice remember that the truth can set you free and with that dumbledore left hermione to her thoughts ever since she gave harry a spearing tackle she been avoiding him for the whole day every time harry was in the area hermione would run away from him afraid that harry might do something to her if he spotted her i think i ll be safe here she said as she sat behind a bush near the lake hermione looked beyond and saw harry talking with hagrid she frowned and wondered when she ll tell the real truth that she broke his broomstick and borrowed it without asking permission harry will kill me said hermione that night hermione climbed into the portrait to see harry ron ginny and neville fortunately harry was absorbed by a game of chess with ron while ginny and neville were reading books at the other side maybe if i just walk quickly harry wontmind me hermione sighed and walked across the common room she was already halfway when harry called her hermione he called as he stood up from the chair i need to talk to you hermione quicken her pace then she felt someone grab her bag forcefully hermione you ve been avoiding me the whole day said harry holding on to hermione bag as if he was going to tear it apart is there something you want to talk about hermione bit her lower lip and pulled the bag from his grasp but that was a mistake rip she pulled to strong the bag ripped into two making her books parchment papers ink bottle quills fall over the firebolt fell down on top of the whole stack there was a very long pause then hermione panicked she didntlook at harry face but she could see he was dumbstruck at the sight of his firebolt split into two and that it was his best friend who did it hermione said harry as if he was trying to put his voice in an even tone what happened hermione felt her lip tremble this was it her friendship with harry is finally over well he said sternly breathing hard then hermione threw herself on her knees and hugged harry hips crying on his crotch yes yes harry it was me who did it i broke it she wailed harry was startled to see hermione like this he looked at ron who was as shocked as him i sorry okay she cried hugging him tightly i didntmean to i wanted to make a simple drawing and i wanted to be accurate so i borrowed your broom without asking permission then i broke it oh harry i such a bad friend hermione cried on his robes even harder still hugging him tightly hermione said harry quietly before you do or say anything i just want to say i didntmean to steal it or break it i not mad at you i was just hermione said harry hermione sniffed and looked up at harry who was giving her a serious look turning brick red hermione stood up gingerly and looked into harry eyes there was a long and silent pause hermione said harry but hermione cut him off harry she said wiping her eyes if you want to hex me then go ahead i deserved it she said raising her arms sideways to shoulder height harry looked bemused i dontwant to hex you hermione lowered her arms and said then punch me she said moving her head closer to him no alright maybe a kick might do me good right she said turning so her back is facing him but harry said during her mid turn i dontwant to kick hermione looked at him puzzlingly what bite me she said hysterically harry gave her a bemused look and said no i dontwant to bite hex or hurt you hermione bit her lower lip and looked down but i broke your broom she said quietly hermione said harry holding her shoulder she was relieved he was smiling when you were admitting how you felt when you were crying it made me realized that i should value friendship more than a broomstick hermione forced a smile look harry continued the damage you did isntbad as my nimbus we can take it to a broom repair shop at hogsmeade and it isntyour fault okay hermione couldnthelp herself she flung her arms around his neck and said thank you for being so nice to me harry no problem he said as they pulled away they were looking at each other with smiles then hermione realized how good he looked with his glasses she blushed what said harry raising an eyebrow hermione didntwhat happened but she moved her head closer to his till there lips pressed there were gasps around the room as ron yelled i knew it he pointed at them amused the both pulled away and harry said hermione he asked perplexedly first you tackle me now you re kissing me hermione blushed s sorry i couldnthelp myself she said apologetically i i just realized how much you cared for me that all harry gave her a look of confusion hermione was hoping he might deny how she felt for him but he smiled and said you can just tell me about it he said i sorry she said but i just want to let you know i lov harry pressed a finger on her lips shut up hermione if you want me to feel the same way as you i suggest we move things slowly okay said harry grinning hermione nodded harry finger on her lips granted she said er excuse me said ron going to them sorry hate to break the moment but would you like me ginny and neville to go so that way you two can bond in the common room by snogging each other senseless and ron hermione spat hitting him on the shoulder ron winced and said in a whimper ouch you hit like a man does this mean anything neville asked from the corner you know the two of you together i mean before hermione could answer harry said neville hermione had a very busy day and i think she needs rest right he said looking at hermione hermione smiled and nodded alright said harry and gave her a kiss on the cheek g night thanks said hermione skipping to the girl dormitory when hermione left harry looked at ron who said that was amusing he said smirking tell me why you went all soft on her harry sighed remember when hermione copy of the dark arts theory was found in shreds yeah why ron asked it was i who accidentally tore it ron gave harry a look of shock that was you why didntyou say anything hermione was so mad at me i had to buy a new one for her you owe me thirty galleons for that no make that thirty five vii a jealous bookworm hermione looked down miserably at the ground she bit her lower lip as she slid a finger on the grassy grounds near the lake it sucked when you have to wait this long for someone when he finishes his date with a girl hermione snorted as she lay down on the ground looking up at the cloudless sky it was very ironic really the afternoon was very pleasant the windy breeze blew around the grounds of hogwarts the sound of hagrid playing the wooden flute the students below third year were playing around while the others were at hogsmeade hermione didntgo to hogsmeade she didntwant to ever since he told asked her for some advice advice that only she hermione can give to him in a very logical way she didntknow why it bothered her to see him ask her for advice on dating actually she was the only one who he went to for advice ever since his problems with cho hermione was there to help him to get cho or any other girl to like him but why did it bother her that he would ask her hermione would feel this thing inside her every time he would tell her that he likes someone from the other houses she had to admit it kind of pained her to see him go to her for advice on the only thing he has a problem on girls hours ago in the common room he went to her for some help hermione hermione looked up from her book it was harry he looked nervous with the way he twiddled his thumbs she gave him a sympathetic look and closed her book showing her full attention on her best friend yes harry bit his lower lip and sighed er i have a bit of a you know a bit of a problem hermione finished for him with a smirk harry smirked gingerly hermione gave him a sympathetic look when he stayed silent well hermione asked harry looked up and said yes i have a problem hermione noticed he started turning red i really want to ask her out this saturday you know he looked confident at hogsmeade hermione sighed she was very fond of seeing her best friend looking nervous over a girl it seemed kind of cute and amusing it been a year since harry asked hermione for advice on these kinds of things i get the idea she said anywho which house is she in ravenclaw said harry who is it er her name is sarah said harry then his face turned to a smile you know the girl who borrowed your quill last week you mean the blonde who took my book without asking she snorted yeah i know her yeah you can go out with her you two seem great she smiled really yeah so any advice do you need er actually i dontneed advice harry said at once hermione arched her eyebrows you dontneed advice then what do you need actually i just want to ask you one question what is it harry paused and said er will you be okay with me going out with sarah hermione felt rather taken by this sort of question what do you mean harry shook his head nah never mind what i said that was stupid c mon harry you can tell me anything hermione said giving him a pleading look okay harry paused will you be okay if i went out with sarah hermione frowned but why would you ask me that er because you know i have this feeling that you know that when we reach seventeen we get this thing for each other and your point is you know i a boy and you re a girl harry turned brick red hermione bit her lip hermione i know it happens to you right harry asked no but i just never thought about it that way she replied i see so will you be okay with it hermione stared into his green eyes beneath his glasses she hated to acknowledge how good he looked yeah she said at once i okay with it harry smiled and kissed her on the cheek hermione giggled as she blushed furiously harry ruffled her hair and left the common room hermione took a deep sigh as she looked down at the lake again she didntknow why she was bothered by that question he asked she never ever had any affection toward harry she knew she loved harry and harry loved her but she usually views their relationship in a platonic way but it really really made her furious when harry and sarah left the entrance hall hand in hand was she being obvious she was as harry pointed out a girl and harry was indeed a boy but why would she be furious when harry was with another girl when she heard that harry and cho kissed hermione felt a bit ticked off that harry kissed a girl but why would she be ticked off it was like just yesterday that that night happened fifth year christmas holiday hermione with ron entered the common room hermione was able to catch a few gryffindors climbing up the staircases that lead to their dorms she grinned that was a good way to end the d a right harry she turned and saw that harry wasntbehind strange she said peering out of the portrait hole wasnthe behind us ron shrugged i dontknow but i was sure that he was still in the room of requirement hermione then asked a question that seemed not like her er was cho inside she asked with a frown i do recall seeing her in the corner of the room when we left when we left everyone wasntthere so maybe she going to give harry a merry christmas hermione sighed anyway it still early maybe i should work on something she was thinking of writing a letter to viktor you do that said ron walking to the hearthrug i think i ll just read a book to pass the time ron took out his wand accio books then the sound like somewhat of a stampede came rushing from above and the next thing hermione knew ron was being attacked by flying books aah he cried as a book came pelting toward him ron you must say it correctly hermione said pointing her wand at them and said a spell that caused all the books to go back inside the boy dormitory sorry said ron brushing himself with his hands i meant to say book but i added an s at least no one was hurt hermione rolled her eyes and took out her transfiguration book from her bag which was still in its place where she left it here read this she tossed the book to ron at least it will help you ron shrugged and lay down at the hearthrug opening the book to read hermione sighed she sat down on the best armchair she pulled her bag and a table to her took out some parchment a quill and an ink bottle and started writing it was only fifteen minutes later when harry came inside the common room hermione peered over her quill to see him and went back to her letter which filled half the parchment she was using what kept you ron asked as harry sank into an empty armchair beside her hermione looked up and realized harry was silent but his face had a glint of shock and satisfaction are you all right harry hermione asked she only received nothing but a shrug which gave hermione a suspicious look ron also had the same reaction because he hoisted his elbow to get a better view of harry what with you he asked what happened harry was silent hermione wondered why then something hit her in the head it was very obvious is it cho hermione said breaking the silence did she corner you after the meeting harry gave her a surprise look and hermione didntknow why she felt something when harry nodded ron started to snigger and with the still the same feeling in her hermione gave ron a serious look which broke him off so er what did she want ron asked in a mock casual voice which irritated hermione she harry began hermione looked at him seriously she er hermione couldnttake harry stuttering and hesitating did you kiss she asked rather briskly hermione heart started beating an unusual pace ron sat up so fast he didntnotice the ink bottle he toppled over making it spill all over the rug disregarding it completely he stared avidly at harry well he demanded the tip of hermione quill slightly jerked when harry nodded leaving an ugly wavy line on the parchment then the following events happened that year which gave hermione new light towards her best friend hermione was a bit startled when she felt her eyes started welling up she realized that she was jealous that harry was with a girl and she was with no one hermione turned sideways and buried her face on her hands when she started holding her sobs she couldntbreak her cool but she couldnttake it before she could cry she felt someone holding her shoulder hermione hermione turned over and saw harry looking down at her in a kneeling position harry she said quickly standing to a sitting position what are you doing here where sarah harry smiled and sat beside her the hogsmeade trip is over said harry i was just going to have some fresh air in the lake then i saw you sleeping actually i wasn t hermione said flatly hermione are you all right harry asked you seem to be sad hermione looked up and forced a smile no i not harry raised an eyebrow you seem to be no she shook her head not looking at him you are harry said i not sad i just look grim are you sure you seem to have a problem hermione couldnttake it so she tried to ask a question that would probably change the subject how was your date with sarah she asked briskly and agitatedly hermione bit her lower lip when harry raised an eyebrow hermione is there something you want to tell me harry moved and knelt in front of hermione he cupped her cheeks and asked well hermione felt a tear fall down on her cheek i i she stuttered is it sarah did she do something to you harry asked did she hurt you hermione felt so touched that harry would be more protective of her than any girl he met hermione hermione shook her head but slowly since harry was still cupping her cheeks are you jealous harry asked difficultly hermione wished she could turn her head but harry was still holding her so she moved her eyes and just stared at her lap are you hermione looked up at him and she felt his thumb wipe the lone tear away hermione he said you can tell me anything then hermione said with her voice as if she was about to cry harry she sniffed i i dontknow i wish i could tell you but i cant not because i hate you i would never hate you she sniffed and started taking in some oxygen to stop her from crying anyway she felt harry thumb rubbing her cheek rather gently i i just cantt tell you o okay it because i here you were there with s sarah and i get these things on m my head i just canttell you how i really feel okay hermione looked down and started crying she felt harry right hand leave her cheek as he lifted her chin with a finger and placed his hand on her cheek when they were looking at each other hermione he said i dontknow what to say of course hermione cut him off you dontknow how it feels to s see you w with other girls i dontwhy but when i heard you kissed cho i tried to acknowledge that y you were my best friend but it s stung me in the chest i i dontknow why b but i hermione couldntfinish her sentence because harry moved forward her and gave her a very gentle yet long kiss she closed her eyes as harry moved his hands to her shoulders hermione returned and held his neck they broke away very slowly and hermione looked at harry with confused thoughts b but what about sarah she asked hermione said harry you may be the smartest witch of our year but there are some parts where you can be unrealistic sometimes hermione gave him a weak smile as harry pulled her to a heartwarming hug harry yes i sorry if i made our kiss er wet like you and cho s dontworry cho was thinking of another boy at that time you however was acceptable hermione smiled and after they pulled away they stood up and started walking to the castle unknown to what going to happened to their future that goes to show that platonic relationships can be broken into something even more even if it is on your girl or boy best friend harry and hermione show an example of that kind of thing other shippers you ve been informed viii a moment in history of magic harry could see nothing but darkness he feels the unmistakable feeling of a fly on the side of his neck harry slaps his neck but even though the feeling of the fly legs is gone he doubts that he killed it rubbing the side of his neck harry opens his eyes to find his head lying sideways on the desk and right in front of him was hermione who was doing the same thing as he was they both smiled at each other harry then sits up and drums his fingers on the table quietly with his right arm he glances on the front to see professor binns the history of magic teacher who is a ghost droning on the different key events on giants history harry feels something soft on the bend of his right arm which was outstretched on the table he sees that hermione whose head was still on the table had her head resting on his arm while she was gazing at the back of ron who was in front of them harry didntknow why but he liked the feel of hermione hair on his arm it was soft and kind of fluffy harry looks at hermione back which was going up and down very slowly by her breathing harry looks at her right hand which was drawing circles on her side of the desk harry gazes at her feet which were doing involuntary movements like twirling around stomping silently and sliding the toes on the floor harry found her involuntary movements kind of cute as the minutes passed by hermione finally left harry arm harry looks at her as she rests her head on her two hands which were placed comfortably on the desk harry does the same and looks at hermione who was blinking in boredom harry sighed sat back on his seat and takes out his notebook he puts it on the table and rests his head on it while he placed the tip of his quill inches from the paper he thinks on what to do probably some drawings to pass the time harry lightly draws on the paper making a drawing of a broomstick he adds detail on the handle giving it wood effects and some bristles to the tail of the broom he moves his eyes up to see hermione looking at the thing he was doing harry ignores this and starts drawing again a little later he adds a quaffle two bludgers and a snitch which were flying around the broom harry draws a curved line behind the bludger to give it the effect of it flying around after adding a bit of detail to the background which was a quidditch pitch he drops his quill to admire his work before he could lift his head and close his notebook hermione who had her head leaning on the table as harry was draws on an empty spot of the drawing with her quill harry doesntprotest as he sees hermione drawing a beautiful owl above his drawing harry smiles at hermione showing his approval he looks at the simple yet well drawn fowl which was drawn in brown ink hermione choice of ink color when she writes harry ink color was black after looking at the final drawing harry writes his signature on the lower right corner of the page he gets a bit startled as hermione hand writes her name below his despite the sudden move he smiles she did draw the owl after all harry sees hermione turning the next page he watches as she draws four lines that made four intersections on each parallel line harry knew what she was doing she wanted to play tic tac toe hermione makes the first move as she placed an x symbol on the center harry makes the second move by placing an o on the left side of the x hermione draws an x on just above harry o which was the upper left box harry sees that hermione needed one more x to win harry puts an o on the lower right box securing that he safe from losing but something in hermione sly grin made him feel that she might pull something fast hermione draws an o on the center top box and puts her quill down harry wonders why and sees the reason hermione has trapped him no matter which o he draws hermione will win harry arches his eyebrows in amazement hermione was a muggle after all she probably plays this game during her childhood years why would she challenge him earlier harry sits up and closes his notebook he puts it aside and yawns as he looks at his wristwatch only thirty minutes left with a groan harry rests his elbow on the back part of hermione chair professor binns was still droning on the front while the others were either sleeping behind there open books staring into space or just not paying attention at all it was kind of peculiar for hermione to be in stupor at class maybe she was stressed out then all of a sudden hermione sits up and sees harry current position hermione then leans on him letting her head rest on his upper arms harry grins as she looks at the front absentmindedly he motions his hand to hermione hair and starts twirling a strand of her bushy hair hermione turns her head at him and gives him a confused grin harry grins back and pats her head abandoning the task of twirling her hair harry removes his arm from the back part of hermione chair making hermione move away from leaning on his arm harry lays his arm outstretched on the table like before and just like before hermione leans on his arm again harry does the same except his head was leaning on hers he was grateful that she didntmake a sudden movement or a flinch she was still but harry could tell she was staring into space and not sleeping since he could see her long eyelashes moving from the blinking for the first time in his life harry was able to take in the scent of hermione hair it had a very fragrant smell harry then realized she was a girl and she was his best friend harry laid there for a few minutes and when his wristwatch told him it was only ten minutes before the time he moved away from hermione hair harry looked around to see that it was nearly noon he cantwait for lunch he starving harry puts his foot on a beam on the feet of hermione chair making his knees a bit elevated hermione sits up and rests her left arm on his knees as if it was an armrest of an armchair then finally the grandfather clock that was at the back of the room chimed signaling the end of the class professor binns tells the class those students who were absent last week should get there checked research work harry who was absent on the day those papers were given due to being in the library at the time stands up and walks to the front of the room while the others exited out of the room he grabs his paper and was glad to see he got an e for his troubles feeling good about himself harry looks at the paper again when he went back to his table he sees hermione has left for lunch and so did ron harry placed his report inside his bag he got his quill some parchment and his history of magic book inside the only thing left on the table was his notebook which was lying open on the page where he drew a sketch about quidditch earlier wondering how it opened when he knew perfectly that he closed it harry took it and was about to close it when he realized there was a change in the sketch the signature of his and hermione was surrounded by a big heart surprised harry looks around and wondered who would have drawn such a thing before harry could elaborate on it he looks at the heart and noticed something about the heart it was drawn in brown ink do you know those shows that feature mexican narrators well here ya go viva la mexico ix harry versus hermione ihola and ibuenas dias a very weird title isn t this is an h hr fluff collection right so why are readers reading fics which involve harry and hermione fighting well the reason why this title is here is because of certain incident that occurred which involves two individuals yes anyway the two special people i mentioning about lived in a place called hogwarts in er actually all we now is that hogwarts is north of london anywho our stories begin in a great friday morning in the lake where we can see our heroes relaxing unfortunately ronald weasley the red head one is having a bit of a problem i hate potions he yells as he closes his heavy potions book thirty eight potions he said in a hushed voice why do snape have to let us memorize thirty eight potions maybe because he a dunderhead ron hermione said agitatedly the reason why you cantstudy well is because you dontput it into heart but i am putting it into heart said ron defensively harry the guy in round glasses shakes his head ron the question is why are you studying on a friday this question proves that ron is indeed a genuine dunderhead as he drops his book and says i i was studying in advance very surprising hermione muttered under her breath anyway the argument will start in a moment you just wait harry the guy in glasses not a geek by the way quite popular looked up to look at the mysterious beyond wondering if his arch nemesis had any plot against him i just dontget it said ron scratching his head as he flicked a page why would we need potions it not like we need it in the future i may hate chemistry in school but ron has a point which leads to hermione saying ron i know snape is very strict at things but we learn these things to get prepared for life after school yeah but i pursuing a quidditch career said ron why would i need potions besides whatever your career is potions is needed what are trying to point out hermione asked hotly that i cantpursue any career except on anything academic ron does a stupid thing and nods thoughtfully yeah something like that because hermione said bossily well said ron giving her an odd look realizing she looked angry er because erm i think harry has the words right harry ron looked at harry with a worried look harry gave a small shudder when hermione glared at him in the eye er harry said nervously actually i think ron is half right and half wrong and why is that hermione asked firmly well harry mopped his brow because you see er what ron meant is that boys do quidditch while girls are you saying boys are better than girls hermione stood up looking at harry as if she would want nothing more but poke his eyes into his skull yes i mean wait no let me say that again but hermione walked toward him making harry stand up quickly as if a roach went up to his pants hermione looked at him and said in a very angry and firm tone harry if you say that girls are the weaker sex than boys then i say prove it harry took a step backward as hermione gave him a glare oooh she said coolly scared of puny girl are you i think harry nearly wet himself but ron braves himself by standing up between them and said c mon guys i know harry didntmean what he said and i know both of you would probably settle this oh yeah said hermione still looking at harry i think we can settle this in a battle of the sexes type of competition wait who what when where how i didntmean thanks a lot ron said harry glaring at ron so up for it hermione spat you may survive voldemort many times but that doesntmake me a weakling harry tried to apologize a sad attempt i must say but hermione would raise her hand to his face hermione i dontwant to compete with you what because you know i ll lose or is it that you are afraid of me hermione said giving him a sly grin harry looks intimidated and said even though he didntwant to say anything i i dontwant to fight you hermione gave him a sigh and said well looks like malfoy is better than you hey said harry hotly dontsay i second best from malfoy then prove it i challenge you to best of five competitions which ron hermione nodded to ron who gave her a surprised look will set up for us what do you say harry bites his lower lip and after a long silence he nodded if we are gonna have a competition said ron clearing his throat trying to break the silence i think we need some deal or stipulation deal harry and hermione said in unison y know like in some competition when one of them wins they will get this or that and the one who loses will get this and that you know what i mean i get it said hermione and looked at harry so harry if i win you have to how about if hermione wins harry has to kiss someone in gryffindor in hermione favor of course said ron quickly adding when harry gave him a look of shock and er i think harry has a stipulation too i think if i win said harry and looked at hermione what would be the one thing he could get back at hermione she a very competitive girl and she always uses her brain to sort things out maybe if harry wins she should quit studying nah that too harsh she might hex harry till next millennium hurry up said hermione irritably ok i ve reach a decision if i win you should tell your deepest and darkest secret with the help of a truth serum harry blurted there was pause and harry thought hermione looked intimidated and a bit worried but she nodded and said deal they shook on it well ron harry asked turning his head to him what is our first competition ron was about to shrug but when hermione did her trademark glare ron thought otherwise and said er wizards chess he said unsure of what he said dunderhead ron said harry shaking his head smirking you cantpit me and hermione together in chess we are not good in it oh i think i up to it said hermione putting her fists on her hips then it settled then said ron rubbing his palms together as if he did something incredible harry versus hermione begins now oh yes things are brewing up eh dontworry this game of chess will be very non violent i hope before we begin said ron as he circled around harry and hermione who were sitting down where a chessboard lay between them i will go through the rules in winning the competition there are five events and both of you should win at least three events winning will earn you points one point for each though for example if hermione wins three events then harry loses since he cantovertake her with only two points and the competition only has five events get it harry and hermione nodded good the first event is wizards chess nothing to explain since i know both of you know this anywho let the game begin harry was white while hermione was black making him the first to move he commanded his pawn to move to e 5 prepare to die potter hermione said in a voldemort like voice the game went on and harry was shocked that hermione was very good at chess considering the two checks she did you re so cute when you panic hermione teased as she saw harry looking around the board for a strategy since in three moves he ll lose giving up no said harry promptly pulling his collar to let out some air just give up harry i gonna win anyway said hermione leaning on the back of the chair i see our competitors are getting on each other shut up harry answered back as he unintentionally commanded his bishop to capture the castle ha said hermione triumphantly as she commanded her queen to capture harry king checkmate she said happily looks like that one to zero harry sat there dumbfounded and looked at his king which was cornered by two bishops and surprisingly a pawn but what how hermione stood up and reached his cheek and pinched it and said in a teasing voice you are so gonna be dead and with that she released him and looked at ron so what next ron ron who was still staring in shock of hermione win looked at harry dumbfounded you mean after all those years being under my wing you were defeated by hermione he said looking lost does that mean i not a good teacher ron look i did my best said harry but i trained you you are my clay i molded you clay harry asked quizzically you know like play doh when we wait where was i oh yeah i cantbelieve hermione beat you that can ruin my reputation harry and if you try to ron hermione said what next ron looked at her and realized what was happening after a few settling down methods ron cleared his throat and said well after that surprise win by hermione he paused and gave harry a look of disgust harry thought ron was taking his lost to hermione rather seriously that makes the score one to zero there are four more events and hopefully harry might catch up what the next event harry asked ron rubbed his chin thoughtfully and finally said are you two still afraid of your worst fears harry and hermione gave him an odd look but shrugged why harry asked because ron said smirking what hermione asked you two stay here meet me at the empty classroom beside the hospital wing somewhere after lunch ron then left the common room leaving our would be couple stories like these could be very predictable in question marks ron hermione asked nervously where did you get it hagrid helped me find it said ron triumphantly we found it lurking in his cabin puzzled too well let me clear it up harry and hermione did what ron told them to do and they found him inside the empty classroom with a moving trunk which contains a boggart but ron said harry isntusing a boggart for competitions sanctioned unless we ask actually i got two for you to face said ron cutting harry off smirking at hermione small whimper one against two one who defeats his or her boggart in the fastest time wins with a coin toss game to determined who goes first hermione loses making her the first to do the takes three to tango challenge ready ron asked unlocking the trunk hermione gave a very nervous nod she looks as if she about cry but always the gentlemen harry goes beside her and says hermione i can go first if you want i understand but hermione took this the wrong way i not afraid harry and i wish you would stop acting so haughty hermione said firmly harry looks taken aback at the sudden comment but he just stood back as hermione sighed and nodded ron to open the trunk ron opened the trunk and harry was expecting professor mcgonagall to come out and tell hermione she failed all subjects but what came out of the trunk wasnta disappointed mcgonagall holding a report card that says she failed it was a man in a black robe his face was very familiar it was dolohov harry put on his guard as hermione raised her wand at him and took a step backwards when she started saying the counter curse r r ridikulus hermione squeaked but her small tiny and shaky voice wasnttoo understandable for the spell to work the boggart dolohov pointed his wand at her and hermione dropped her wand as her mouth hung slightly hermione harry yelled running to her dolohov brandished his wand at her and a purple jet of light came bursting out of his wand ah hermione squealed as harry tackled her out of the purple lights line of fire harry pinned her to protect her as she clung to him harry looked down and saw she was closing her eyes tightly tears falling down across her cheeks ridikulus harry looked at ron who did the spell and saw the boggart dolohov turning to a spider without difficulty he lazily said the counter curse glad thing he overcame his fears a few months back the spider turned into a soccer ball and ron kicked it pell mell to the trunk before shutting it tight there was silence in the room and only hermione whimpers could be heard as she clung to harry very tightly ron was the first to break the silence look i sorry i put you up to this and i understand if you donttalk to me and but unfortunately for our redhead here harry was looking down at hermione who was crying harry was kind of disturbed when he saw her shocked face when dolohov walked to her hermione harry said quietly stroking her brown hair giving her comfort are you alright hermione hermione made a high but soft sob and looked up at him i i sorry harry she said softly almost in a whisper e ever s s since then i i it okay hermione said harry warmly as he hugged her which kind of felt awkward for his part wait ron is still talking in the background i i dontwant to e experience it i ll never have the c courage and bravery y you and r ron have hermione said quietly hermione harry pulled her away you are brave as me and ron look you told mcgonagall about my firebolt and that was brave knowing that you would face a lot of cold shoulders from us and i sorry about that hermione sniffed and her eyes were filled with pleading for another hug and since those hardcore h hr shippers say they can communicate without words harry pulls her gently to another hug dontworry hermione i promise that no death eater or dolohov or any dark lord will hurt you promise hermione said weakly on his shoulder promise said harry and out of the blue harry felt his shoulder wet not because he wet himself no of course hermione was crying hermione you can stop now said harry gingerly patting her back i i sorry she said pulling herself from him and looked down i i just feel very vulnerable that all i if dolohov can get me that fast what will happen if v voldemort d does the k killing curse to me harry held her cheeks and said hermione no one will hurt you but hermione continued sobbing biting her lower lip to stifle the moans then harry looked at her sympathetically and gives her kiss on the forehead which of course since every h hr story has this scene quite clich if you ask me made her stop and looked at him harry she asked weakly as harry kissed her on the cheek feel better harry asked giving her a warm smile but before harry could get an answer hermione moved slowly and pressed her lips on his harry never expected this but us shippers did and when they both pulled away hermione wiped a lone tear away and said i think i feel a lot better she said hugging him there was silence then harry realized what happened when ron blurted out o oh my merlin y you two j just k kissed this isntwhat i planned out he gave a small laugh i was expecting you two to make up after that little heated argument back then and i see that i never saw this coming and again us shippers so this coming hermione laughed and stood up thanks to harry hand for support i think i ready to leave now and for the competition she said looking at harry i ll call it even all bets are off harry smiles and nods giving her a small peck on the cheek c mon guys you can continue your bonding later said ron opening the door we know bonding can lead to touching and touching can lead to grandchildren and nephews hermione and harry smiled at each other and left the room with ron following them at their wake so what do you think eh not the action pack funny comedy setting you expected well there are other fluffs to come so please bear with a mexican narrator as the author calls me and wait for more and oh as for the lovely shippers of h hr i salute you ihasta la vista if there is a problem with my spanish grammar please notify me if you speak fluent spanish thank you
