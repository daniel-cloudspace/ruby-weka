 x a certain salutation hogwarts hearsay issue 2 volume 1 friday 28th february if any of our dear readers had any doubts that hogwarts most famous couple amos diggory and lily evans have split reporter for hogwarts hearsay rita skeeter is of the opinion that your speculation may have ample grounds mr diggory has revealed that the head girl has recently abandoned all self worth and dignity she may have previously owned by resorting to beg her former boyfriend to take her back even offering to deliberately sabotage tomorrow match against ravenclaw so as to secure hufflepuff position in the quidditch finals as any hogwarts quidditch fan would know for hufflepuff to be back in the running for this year cup ravenclaw must beat the house that hufflepuff lost to gryffindor does this not mean that james potter captain of the gryffindor team and mr diggory long time rival might do well to lead his team to victory and secure mr diggory failure it is the opinion of the majority of hogwarts that mr potter ardour for miss evans is critically misplaced if the object of his affections is willing to dash all his hard work on behalf of the team only to spite him by returning to the arms of mr diggory the words in front of lily vanished as she tore the piece of parchment off the wall where someone had stuck it to the stones ever since the article had come out the day before the head girl had been furiously ripping copies of hogwarts hearsay off the walls of the castle wishing she could rip out something else preferably skeeter hair eyes toenails or vital organs on the way down to breakfast on that saturday morning she and verity succeeded in collecting a grand total of twenty seven articles each one bringing her mood further down a few notches it wasntreally the fact the rita skeeter was writing rubbish about her because anyone with even half a brain cell would know that there was about as much chance of lily asking diggory to take her back as there was of mcgonagall beginning a tap dance on the high table it was more the fact that lily was letting that cow get to her it wasnta nice feeling lily had a certain talent for entrances and that morning was no exception it could definitely be said that she stormed in and the weather did a lot to help this description there was coincidentally a late winter storm raging against the castle outside when lily and verity opened the doors to the great hall every head in the room turned to see them with crumpled parchment in their hands and with lily expression murderous enough for the both of them there was silence filled only by the noise of the thunderstorm outside as if it were embarrassed at the lack of the earlier conversation in the hall and was desperately trying to make small talk like an uncomfortable guest students sat in rapt attention as the head girl and her best friend made their imperial way across the hall to the gryffindor table and sat in the only spaces on the gryffindor table ones that james had made sure stayed available he was watching lily very carefully morning lilo sirius tried always one to be liberal with the safety of his life there was a brief silence good morning sirius lily replied perfectly politely remus began to pour pumpkin juice over his toast he was so shocked are you all right lily he asked cautiously hm replied lily oh yes fine you never been better said remus unnerved as lily reached for an orange from the fruit bowl in front of her james picked up one of the crumpled articles that she had left on the table do you think if we all start actually believing what skeeter says she ll be fuelled with the unstoppable thrill of power and ultimately explode he asked conversationally lily head turned slowly to face the boy beside her at which point she blinked twice the hall held its breath this was it they were going to witness the murder of james potter by way of choking on the orange in the head girl hand but then lily did something no one not even she had expected she laughed it was a laugh that showed lily didntgive a toss that the entire hall was staring at her it was a laugh that had its roots in the stomach its leaves in the lungs and its pretty flowers in the voice it was a laugh that said defiantly oi what your problem aintyou never seen anyone laughing before james grinned as whispers began to break out over the four house tables this was surreal indeed the only thing more odd than lily evans laughing at james potter jokes was if hagrid suddenly started talking in a german accent come on james said taking her by the arm gryffindor changing rooms now he hollered and the players hurriedly began to say goodbye to their friends or scoop the last spoonfuls of porridge into their mouths outside the storm had lessened off a little with the realisation that all may be well again the thunder clouds were still hanging overhead but the rain had dribbled off into a drizzle lily was still giggling to herself while james was escorting her across the grounds verity jogged to catch them up and put a hand on her friend shoulder lilo are you all right hee hee hee lily replied daintily wiping a tear from the corner of one eye can you imagine she asked gleefully holding up an outstretched hand rita skeeter bang the head girl collapsed into a fit of giggles again i knew it verity hissed at james i knew you d do it one day and today the day you ve driven her completely crackers hooch i am scandalised james said as he set a gasping lily down on one of the benches although you re quite right you do have to be crackers to laugh at my jokes verity tripped on her own feet this day was getting more bizarre by the minute the james of two years ago would have never said something like that the james of two years ago would have smirked because everyone probably would be laughing at his jokes and if they weren t he d repeat them only louder feeling a spell of dizziness coming on verity went off to get changed lily was still having the odd burst of soft giggles when she lined up next to james just inside the entrance to the changing rooms james was grinning it was a rather amazing feeling making lily laugh he didntthink he d ever had that pleasure before usually he was making her either growl in a threatening manner roll her eyes in exasperation or tear her hair out in fury as remus magnified voice began to echo throughout the pitch james thought that making lily laugh would be a good habit to pick up students professors witches wizards and anyone else i ve missed remus announced from the commentator box this is the hogwarts quidditch pitch we ll start the bidding at six sickles thank you sir anyone for seven yes you in sixth row eight for you in the ravenclaw scarf going going sold for eight sickles thank you madam and now on to today match james grip tightened on his broomstick as the ravenclaw team jogged onto the muddy pitch behind their captain the familiar adrenaline was beginning to simmer in his ribcage presenting the ravenclaw team keats edwards peterson howe connor chein and their captain rys peterson has apparently been training hard these past months to replace the former seventh year chaser frederick fearless tyler verity leaned forward and tapped lily on the shoulder good luck lilo she whispered with a wink i d wish you luck but you hardly need it lily whispered back smiling weakly same to you luvvie verity said patting her friend on the shoulder let go thrash em hm and their opponents the gryffindors black hooch tall barker kipping evans and their captain potter in this team recent news ainsley tall has successfully recovered from the injury he sustained whilst falling down the stairs over the holiday period when asked to comment he retains that it was the unusually large amount of brandy his grandmother put in the christmas pudding it wasntlong before mr richards limped up to the lines of players being lamed in the last of gryffindor quidditch matches james saw he had gotten someone to reattach his leg the referee gave sirius a poisonous look as he passed the seventh year boy yeah that right james heard him mutter it back on no thanks to you looking good sir sirius nodded cheerfully and mr richards shook his head and limped on the ravenclaw captain was an extremely tall sixth year girl with a mass of violently orange wildly curly hair that added at least three inches to her height even without the hair she was almost as tall as james when he shook her hand with a friendly smile lily was sure she wasntthe only one who saw emmeline rys smile shyly and try to push her hair behind her ear good grief was absolutely everyone in love with potter sometimes it seemed to her as if she were the only sane person for miles mount your brooms mr richards called and as the players mounted so did the tension that was the whistle and there they go immediately the noise in james ear doubled as the crowd cheered harder first possession taken by gryffindor it simon kipping for gryffindor gaining yards by the second is that a new broom i see him riding yes it is and rumour has it that particular model is not available to the wizarding public at large and can only be obtained via the russian military james sped alongside simon and his russian broomstick while verity flew on simon other side at the sight of a ravenclaw chaser approaching him fast in the opposite direction simon feigned passing left to james and when the ravenclaw keeled off to his left simon passed right to verity hooch scores declared remus and gryffindors throughout the stands celebrated there seemed to be a general movement among the third years of shooting sparkly bits of red and gold parchment out of their wands in festivity and james thought sullenly that professor flitwick had never bothered to teach them that charm ten nil to gryffindor and possession returns to edwards for ravenclaw who passes straight down to peterson lily was feeling good all things considered all things being that she was suspended forty feet in the air wet freezing and scared witless however this was a lot better than last time last time being when she felt she might pass out with fright or embarrassment or both the ravenclaw seeker and captain rys was shouting encouragement to her chasers but lily wondered whether they could hear her with the inconvenience of her hair which had a habit of being blown in front of her face lily who had quite a lot of hair herself had dragged her ringlets back to the top of her head plaited them and fastened them with industrial strength elastic however she only had about a fifth of rys hair so why wouldntthe ravenclaw captain have taken something in the way of her own precautions anyway lily had no time to worry about hair whether it was hers or the opposition s she still hadntscoured the ravenclaw end of the pitch and the score was now thirty twenty to the ravenclaws so with renewed determination and confidence that only comes when your hair is staying right where you want it to lily flew down the other end of the pitch and continued her search james on the other hand wasnthaving such a good time of it his troubles though were nothing to do with his hair since he had long accepted the fact that his hair would never stay right were he wanted it to his quandary had arisen as a result of the ravenclaw captain who didntseem to want to leave her chasers alone due to her unnaturally large amount of involvement with them it seemed to james as if it was four ravenclaws against three gryffindors and this was very off putting for him and for his fellow chasers he imagined she also wouldntstop looking at him it wasntthat james had a problem with people looking at him on the contrary he had a more of a need than most people to be the centre of attention however rys was giving him the sort of looks that indicated she was looking at him to see if he was looking at her which of course james had to when he was constantly feeling her stare in the back of his head the above distractions were probably factors leading to the consequence of ravenclaw leading sixty thirty james ran his hands through his hair in irritation and caught the quaffle that simon had just spun under a ravenclaw chaser and the quaffle goes to potter for gryffindor who evades a tackle by ravenclaw connor bludger ahoy james saw it speeding straight at him thinking fast he tossed the quaffle up above him shoved the end of the broom down hard and heard the black ball whiz past over his head the quaffle on the other hand fell straight into his arms on its downward trip and since the bludger had cleared the air of ravenclaw chasers james beat the keeper and scored twenty eight and half minutes in and the score is now sixty forty to the ravenclaws possession goes to edwards which side will score again before the half hour it turned out to be ravenclaw twice once when ainsley mistook rys for a chaser who could be passed to and tried to cover her shooting range as well as the three real chasers once when james got distracted when trying to tackle peterson it eighty forty and once again the ravenclaws have twice as many points as the gryffindors do it seems the lions are having a bit of an off day remus said curiously into the microphone usually they re renowned for having one of the school strongest teams of chasers i wonder what going wrong today gaining confidence lily wound her way though balls and players with increasing speed through the previously indistinguishable cheering of the crowd there emerged the sound of definite words lily frowned in incredulousness as the words took on a tune and spread ferociously through the stands some saddo had made up a song go potter go on potter on a broomstick no one hotter it not how he looks it just how he plays although he still gorgeous on his worst hair days james was sure the suspension on sirius broomstick was suffering dramatically with the way it was shaking with his best friend laughter rolling his eyes he screwed his concentration back onto the game although he couldnthelp listening with half an ear even with about eight hundred people belting it out the song didntseem to mean a thing when the words werentlily s despite ahem enthusiastic support remus said after trailing off his commentary to listen to the song potter team is still dragging behind with seventy points to ravenclaw one hundred and twenty bludger towards hooch black stop that bloody hysterical giggling and do your job the noise level on the pitch immediately plummeted to the level of mass whispering with people muttering gleefully to their friends or demanding of them what had been said that was so scandalous i mean remus amended quickly his voice low with embarrassment gryffindor behind enough already alright alright james heard sirius shout gliding away to follow the nearest bludger i ll take care of your girlfriend dontget too stressed now verity threw the quaffle at his head remus defensive muttering was interrupted however because the crowd had started up another verse of singing a few seconds in and lily felt like flying away over the forbidden forest to escape the indignity of it all go evans go on evans chase that snitch up to the heavens we know you can catch it at any distance and then while you re at it give potter a chance seizing the quaffle and dodging a ravenclaw chaser james held out a grateful hand to the crowd shouting thank you thank you as if they were all mps that had backed him up in a parliamentary argument shooting at the ravenclaw goal and awarding gryffindor ten points he turned to lily and hollered see public opinion in my favour lily was sure that her lungs were slowly shrivelling up with chronic embarrassment and she rolled her eyes in a bid to look like she couldntcare less about the stupid song in their sweep across the sky her eyes caught on something like your school uniform sometimes unluckily gets caught on a piece of classroom furniture something of that sort had happened to lily last year in potions when her skirt had gotten caught on a dented cauldron and flashed her underwear to everyone exiting the classroom behind her since then james had tripled his efforts in getting her attention anyway her eyes had caught on something bright and shiny and for the first time during the match it wasntthe ravenclaw captain hair the snitch was playfully fluttering around the base of the right gryffindor goalpost as if it sensed it had been spotted and had the glaring searchlights of a prison tower focused on it the snitch darted off towards the centre of the pitch wings humming fiercely in a bid to escape capture the rational part of lily brain shut off completely leaving the irrational part a free reign on the decision making front the irrational part was not really accustomed to having this privilege very often as lily was by and large a very rational person so when lily chose on the rare occasion to be irrational she certainly didntdo it by half therefore it wasntsurprising from a psychological point of view when she made her broomstick drop like a sickle off the top floor of gringotts it was fairly surprising from a spectator point of view however which was probably why a massive gasp gripped the crowd and a third of the onlookers stood up in shock twisting around to see what all the fuss was about james froze as he saw lily hurtling towards the ground then before he could even attempt to make sense of it all it all made sense by itself lily eyes were determined and her hands firmly clasping the broom handle she was plummeting towards the grass with a purpose and next second james saw the purpose glinting gold against the green come on lily he hollered at the top of his voice whoa he added jerking out of the way as the ravenclaw captain sped past him faint panic on her face lily dive went shallower as she curved level with the ground on nearing it the snitch zipped back and forth only ten metres in front of her but she was gaining in the very top of her vision a mass of frizzy orange hair on a broomstick was flying towards her and towards the snitch lily willed herself to go even faster bracing her knees tightly on either side of her nimbus she took one hand off the handle and reached out in front of her her fingers brushed the humming wings of the snitch startled the golden ball hopped further ahead its humming now seemingly desperate beyond the snitch lily could see rys approaching fast in exactly the opposite direction to herself here lily was faced with a dilemma should she be sensible and clever and pull away before either of them got hurt or should she be fantastically stupid and rush into a lethal game of chicken chicken it was then it was merely the issue of lily hatred of losing moreover it was lily hatred of losing to rys it didntquite make sense but she suddenly felt this abject disgust at the prospect of losing to someone who fancied potter a doubt flickered in her mind for a nanosecond as doubts frequently tend to do in these life or death situations was it that she didntwant to lose to someone who liked potter or was it that she didntwant to lose to someone who liked potter and so lose potter to someone who liked him this thought was made less sense than the previous one and besides lily had more important things to think about for example stretching out her palm the ravenclaw captain mirrored this movement grinning because the snitch was flying away from lily and towards her it a game of niffler on the gringotts tracks remus exclaimed to the enthralled crowd the snitch is heading towards the ravenclaw seeker but evans is getting closer by the second the ravenclaw seeker was looking terrified now that lily was showing no inclination of swerving away and was actually closer to the snitch her hair was even frizzier with fright but her eyebrows were furrowed in determination and lily had to hand it to her she was being very brave either that or fancying someone made you do crazy things lily suddenly saw what was going to happen she saw all the events in row one by one the snitch would finally twig that it was flying straight into rys hands and then fly upwards to avoid the both of them leaving herself and rys to crash into each other neither having caught the snitch now she understood why you always had to be two steps ahead in chess now she understood why people won wars because of foresight and now she understood why people who were good at chess and winning wars were also very good at making a lot of money on the stock market she and rys were merely three metres away from each other when the captain shut her eyes tightly and lily jerked her broom handle upwards curling over rys like a dolphin leaping over the surface of the sea inhaling in a great rush the head girl saw rys rocket past underneath her just as the snitch froze in the face of the ravenclaw and decided to whiz upwards instead as rys careered off behind lily empty handed the snitch rose upwards to the redhead eye level lily smiled before snatching it out of the air having won the quidditch game the head girl needed little else to make her happiness complete and this little happened to be entirely encompassed in a long warm bath sighing she crossed the hall of the heads dorms and entered that bathroom so eager to begin running the water that she forgot to do one very important thing soon quidditch robes shin pads arm pads socks shoes and underwear littered the floor of the bathroom as lily sunk into the foam capped water soaking in all the warmth and breathing in the sweet smelling formulas that mixed in with the water she closed her eyes and lay back setting her ankles down on the far edge of the bathtub with her knees bent and smiled as foam crawled down her legs back onto the water whistling james strode into the heads dorms on top of the world he even did a little skip as he passed the coffee table un strapping his arm pads and tossing them onto the sofa still whistling he went up his staircase and came back down in his boxers and a t shirt making for the bathroom lily opened her eyes when she heard a click she d forgotten to lock the door she realised with mild surprise oops the head boy reached a crescendo in his whistling as he crossed the tiled floor and stationed himself in front of the sink then he switch to humming tunelessly as he loaded his toothbrush with paste and stuck it into his mouth he then realised that the mirror above the sink was fogged up and wiped it clear again with the palm of his hand before he began brushing his teeth it was a few seconds before he thought about what he had just done where had the fog on the mirror come from why was there steam in the room and where was that sweet smell coming from lily watched james turn around very slowly with his mouth covered in toothpaste and his brush sticking out the side james could do nothing more than freeze up the moment he saw her there she was in the bath and by the amount of clothes on the floor in front of her he was pretty sure she wasntwearing anything in the bath then there the fact that her hair was piled on top of her head in curls with the odd coil hanging down into the water her fingers dripped over the side from her arms resting on the edge of the bathtub and then there was simply the way her feet ran into her ankles that ran into her shins that ran down into the foamy water he didntthink the way his glasses were fogging up had anything to do with the warmth of the air lily smirked internally as she watched him turn redder by the second his face was like a remembrall in the hands of a dying man who forgotten to sign his last will and testament she crooked an eyebrow evening in an uncharacteristic spasm of sudden movement james turned round spat in the sink chucked his brush into the cup above it and sprinted out the door slamming it shut with a bang lily sank further down into the bubbles covering her shoulders laughing at the look of colossal shock that hit the head boy straight in the face after her brief giggling fit she contemplated what a colossal fraud he was the most sought after bachelor of hogwarts was panicked by the sight of her little old lily evans taking a bath hee hee what a joke james on the other hand was not laughing he had not stopped running until he had arrived in his dorm and even then began sporadically pacing trying to get his brain past a single image that had been burnt into the core of his mind it wasntjust her hair it was her shoulders her neck her eyes glazed over with steam swallowing he went to open a window and sat down on his bed wiping the toothpaste off his mouth needless to say his dreams that night involved pale skin red hair a lot of bubbles and a certain salutation a n heya guys sorry it been so long the good news is that this week

original meathead thank you so much glad you liked the chappy poor james indeed d next chappy rita turns hogwarts hearsay into a family business the paparazzi stalk sirius lily tests her public speaking skills and fails miserably lots of luff your on holiday author eleven worth mentioning sunday went by for lily in slow trickle of sitting around chatting happily and maybe the odd spattering of work here and there during which she noticed that james had considerable difficulty in meeting her eye oh well she was sure he d get over it soon do you happen to have any idea why james keeps going red every time you speak to him verity asked while they were sat comfortably in the gryffindor common room so that lily could help a fifth year with his charms owl essay verity was tucking into a box of cockroach clusters and lily was stealing one every so often for strength when she had to point out to lewis bourche that magic was got spelt with a k coincidently at that moment the portrait hole opened and james himself scrambled in the girls glanced at each other and tried to pretend that they had not just been talking of him with their position right next to the boys staircase there was no way he could not acknowledge them hello verity james greeted his chaser swiftly lily he nodded and made his hasty was up the stairs without stopping to chat verity looked at lily inquiringly i sure i have no idea said lily innocently is this right lewis asked her passing her his piece of parchment there a full stop right here lily said tapping the offending sentence patiently as the boy diligently went back to work and verity went back to throwing clusters into her mouth lily wondered why she didnttell her best friend about the whole bathroom lark the night before it would have been quite funny if the story had gotten out to the school at large as it undoubtedly would have she didntthink potter herd of mindless fans would be quite as impressed with his poise and confidence if they knew about the funny looking half strangled look on his face as he tore out of that bathroom faster than simon russian broomstick so why had she not said anything maybe it was because of the fact that james had done a runner at all if he hadn t not only would she have made sure that he couldntsee his own body anymore from her curses but she would have had no qualms about letting everyone in on what happened and hoping that potter would be expelled but that look on his face had been so funny and that desperate sprint for the door had been so quaint that she sort of regarded it as something she liked about potter and for now she wanted to keep it to herself at exactly twenty three minutes past eleven on sunday night a figure could be noticed creeping along the ninth floor from corridor to corridor occasionally hiding behind statues and avoiding moonlight wherever possible such behaviour could have been seen as a little unnecessary considering that the figure was wearing all black robes a pair of black shoes and the leg of a pair of black tights over her head not a sound was uttered by the individual apart from a small strangled squawk when the loose leg of her tights got caught on a door handle maybe these measures were a little extreme but when you dontwant to be seen you dontwant to be seen and rita skeeter didntwant to be seen finally reaching her destination the gossip queen cum cat burglar flattened herself against the wall and reached sideways to turn the handle of the door to a classroom light flooded out into the corridor and disappeared again as rita slipped inside preferring not to acknowledge the fact that she tripped from a combination of the doorframe and her heals nita she hissed into the room nita are you here anita another blonde head popped up from behind the professor desk at the front of the room a camera swung from the neck attached to the head oh it you said the girl scrambling up from the floor and setting down the camera on the desk well who else would it be rita asked scornfully hagrid it could have been a teacher anita skeeter replied in a tone equally as contemptuous and i haventgot a detention yet i d like to keep my record clean for as long as possible thanks my heart bleeds for you rita said sarcastically wrinkling her nose in a sneer now shut your irritating little gob and listen i want you to do something for me get stuffed it in your interest anita regarded her sister levelly for a moment gab on then rita cleared her throat no one is believing any thing written in hogwarts hearsay all my careful efforts are going to waste and that evans cow is still bloody queen of the castle oh merlin anita sniggered donttell me you re still after james potter haventyou heard he hates you after you ve been so horrible evans rita lashed out and seized one of her sister white blonde plaits pulling hard squealing anita clawed away at rita face and the scuffle lasted around five seconds before both of them began to fear for either their hairstyle or their cosmetic charms there followed a few moments where both parties sorted themselves out huffing and sniffing as they peered into mirror charms and raked fingers through hair he wonthate me for long rita said to her reflection above the tip of her wand when he reads the next issue of hogwarts hearsay his opinion of me will change for having such amazing reporting skills and his opinion of evans will change even more oh yeah anita nodded dramatically because of course he believed everything you ve ever written along with the rest of the school that where you come in sister dearest rita smiled so widely it looked as if when she stopped her mouth would make a snapping sound like a stretched rubber glove the next story i have is fantastic and completely outrageous anyone who hasntbeen living at the bottom of the lake for the past ten years would never believe it but the thing that going to make it work is photographic evidence you want me to take a photograph anita said with disdain well you may not have realised this rita but when you make stuff up you cantactually capture it on camera wrong as usual rita sighed i want you to make a photograph what i know you can do it you know the charms you know everything about that odd little machine of yours and that doesntmean i ll do it you said it was in my interest rita put a finger to her chin in an act of sudden remembrance so i did tell you what your interest is i wonttell mum about the photos you ve sneakily been taking of sirius black how about that you wouldn t anita narrowed her eyes and why not the eleven year old changed tracks immediately she slapped an innocent expression on her face widening her eyes and pouting you d blackmail your own little sister she asked pitifully darling i d blackmail curse sabotage or steal anyone or anything to get james i wontbe beaten by anyone at the end of her inspiring speech rita struck a pose with her chin in the air pouting slightly then she wrinkled her nose especially not anyone with hair that colour smiling in a self satisfied way whilst her sister sulked rita sat herself on a desk and picked up anita camera now off you go she said to her sister pleasantly handing her the camera run along and get you little potions ready i ll give you my commission tomorrow oh it going to be genius anita snatched the strap of her machine and stomped furiously towards the door she stopped level with her sister and turned her head towards her with a face like thunder i hear she beginning to like him you know rita pinched her hard wednesday found the gryffindor quidditch team in the changing rooms as usual expecting to be worked to the very edge of their capabilities by james who seemed to have gotten even more mental in the short space of time between the last game and then everybody get the sod out of those cubicles quickly he hollered into the changing rooms we have a mountain of stuff to do today those slytherins arentgoing to thrash themselves you know lily frowned and bit her lip as she fiddled with the clasp of her necklace and skilfully opened the door of her cubicle using only her elbows the damn thing just wouldntcome undone and lily sat down on the wooden bench against the wall sighing in frustration hello lily jumped as someone sat down next to her tinkling her chain swung around her neck as she turned to see whom it was sirius grinned at her flashing his teeth hello said lily suspiciously then she went back to fiddling with her clasp sirius leaned his elbows on his knees but frowned when he saw a kind of light it was only there for a fraction of a second then it was gone did you see that he asked frowning see what replied lily in a low distracted voice nothing so how are you lilo sirius asked her shrugging pleasantly we ve not had a good old chat in ages i feel what going on then how life fine lily replied frowning in the oddness of this conversation nothing interesting happen to you over the past few days sirius continued agreeably nothing even slightly amusing or entertaining no nothing worth mentioning no lily said distractedly her clasp still wouldntobey her will and sirius voice was beginning to irritate her how you relationship with prongs these days sirius asked intent on not giving up lily turned to face him with a frown are you still here she asked exasperatedly you d better get a move on you know he told her conversationally or prongs will come in here and haul you out himself he completely gotten over that bathroom incident on sunday lily froze then she faced sirius with her mouth agape he told you about that she asked incredulously nyes s s sirius smirked smugly indeed he did lily closed her eyes and hung her head sirius leaned back against the wall in satisfaction it quite funny if you think about it he chatted and i fully commend you for your handling of the situation see me i would have cursed the bloke head off sirius was cut off abruptly when lily suddenly seized the collar of his quidditch uniform and dragged his face towards hers the dark haired boy swallowed in the green blaze of the head girl irises the pupils of which were small with concrete determination i should probably say lily murmured in a low voice that if any mention of that gets out make no mistake i will make sure that you spend the rest of your natural life peeing through a straw sirius eyebrows drifted upwards while his eyes squinted at the prospect of such immense pain thank you he said weakly as lily released her grip on his collar and stood up striding out of the changing room with a smile on her face it took sirius a moment to gather himself frowning and blowing outwards in relief until he got up and trotted after lily into the sunlight of the quidditch pitch lily was still battling with her necklace when james turned around from watching ainsley checking the elasticity charms on the quaffles my grandmother gave me her christmas present last week james was saying conversationally to the younger boy bit late for christmas presents isntit asked ainsley while he bounced a quaffle on the grass as his long dreadlocks bounced free yeah well my old nan is a bit dotty james said the tone of his voice clearly getting at something she lives on some massive farm in deepest darkest suburbia herds sheep for a living oh really ainsley replied obviously not that interested do you know what she gave me for christmas tall ask james no a pair of sheep shearers ainsley stopped bouncing the ball all right all right he sighed dropping it and raising his hands to his head i ll tie it up stop getting shirty james turned at the sounds of lily and sirius footsteps approaching there you are he said without waiting to be asked he turned lily around by the shoulders and took the clasp from her fingers frowning sirius squinted when he thought he saw a slight flash of white light again and heard a faint mechanical noise looking around he saw nothing and so dismissed it once more lily chain shook slightly as the head boy fiddled with it i was beginning to wonder whether you d gotten lost what were you both doing in there lily was just about to say talking when sirius smirked at her and said snogging lily necklace stopped shaking abruptly what james asked oddly as lily smiled snogging she repeated while sirius stuffed a fist in his mouth you know broom closet activity getting off with each other pulling for england lily felt her necklace tighten slightly for a moment then she heard a snapping sound and soon after a large thump behind her eyebrow raised sirius peered round lily to see the form of his best friend spread eagled on the grass and completely unconscious wupsie man down quidditch practice that wednesday was decidedly cancelled as lily verity and sirius sat in the hospital wing on both sides of the bed that the head boy was currently sprawled on it had taken them half an hour to drag him up all those stairs because none of them happened to have their wands with them once they had arrived in madam pomfrey territory the nurse had thrown a fit he passed out with no explanation well lily and i might have played a joke on him by telling him that we were conducting a sordid affair in the gryffindor changing rooms sirius had told her yes well i think it best not to enervate him after such trauma madam pomfrey had decided while lily cringed at the humiliation now the three gryffindor seventh years were assembled around the bed on which their comrade was stretched out on lily was unsuccessfully trying to pry her broken necklace from james clutches verity was watching with mild amusement and sirius was looking rather bored by the whole situation as though he d been in his current situation a thousand times before i dunno why she doesntjust enervate him he remarked offhandedly while madam pomfrey was out of earshot it hardly a very serious trauma if you think about it i mean who wouldnt want to snog me in the changing rooms glancing at each other both lily and verity raised their hands well i mean you know sirius dithered and then gave up lily went back to battling with the industrial strength grip james had on her chain hey lilo sirius grinned from across the bed if you want him awake why dontyou try your mouth to mouth method again lily looked up shock he told you about that too she demanded a blush crawling its traitorous way up her cheeks nyes s s indeed he did sirius grinned gleefully scandalised lily stared at the impassive face of the head boy for a moment before sighing and letting her head drop forward onto his chest with a thump twat twat twat she could be heard muttering hammering her forehead against his chest with every word excuse me yes hi verity said from sirius other side when was this what are you talking about what happened what i ll tell you later sirius said dismissively no you will not lily exclaimed jerking her head up face it lilo it was going to get around sooner or later yes all because of this arsehole lily replied banging her fist onto james chest for good measure sirius watched her for a moment what exactly is it that you hate about prongs again he asked levelly and verity looked at her as well lily on the other hand looked back at them as if they were both as stupid as each other wha i if you think for one it lily began and began again i dontknow she said exasperatedly before she realised how stupid she sounded it just the general way he acts all right yes but what is there in particular about him that contributes to this general way he acts then lily didntsay anything for the simple reason that she could not think of anything to say her first thought had been to say something along the lines of i donthave to answer any of your idiotic questions you hopelessly irritating nosey parker but that would mean sirius would win because she wouldnthave proved her immense detest for potter or she could have said something to the effect of i think you ll find there is nothing particular implied in the word general black you freak but that still would not have proved her completely valid point so she did what he asked she tried to think of something she hated about potter and the answers came easily she hated the way he was nasty to people for no apparent reason no wait he d stopped doing that she hadntseen him do that in ages she hated the way he gave himself an excuse to laugh at other people when he played cruel practical jokes on them no hold on these days all his stunts seemed to have himself and the rest of the marauders as the butt of their jokes and those that didntwere always targeted at people who undoubtedly deserved it she hated the way he was an insufferable show off about absolutely bloody everything that he was good at which incidentally was everything oh wait he didntquite seem to show off so much anymore not at all in fact and the only thing he talked a lot about was quidditch which he had a right to because he was team captain and he knew what he was talking about she hated the way he arrogantly obliterated any resemblance of order in his hair but now it didntseem to her as much of a stuck up gesture as much as a nervous habit really terrifyingly lily mind went utterly blank completely clean as clear as the sky on a midsummer day and hollow as a well of the abyss there was nothing there absolutely naught to back her up nil to prove herself with and zip to say come on i ll tell you all about it on the way to the fat lady sirius murmured to verity and they both stood up quietly and crept towards the door as they arrived in the corridor outside sirius eyes flashed for the third time that day and a light clicking noise pricked his ears did you see that that flash he asked urgently and verity shook her head while in the hospital wing their head girl just stared seemingly at nothing looking as though everything she knew has just imploded colourfully away into oblivion sometime during the night lily did in fact realise that she had been staring at nothing and that sirius and verity had left she looked at james on the bed in front of her his fingers still clenched around her necklace snoring gently the candles in the hospital wing had long dimmed down to cast a translucent hue over the stark white sheets and the candlelight glinted off james glasses as his eyelashes flickered slightly beneath them lily stared at his face for a long time during which everything inside her head went through a long and laborious process of consequential shifting like one of those sliding jigsaw puzzles in a little plastic grid that you got in christmas crackers every year one little piece of information had changed and now everything had to be moved about to try and find an arrangement where everything made sense again such unfortunately was lily mind according to previous records lily had been informed that james was a nasty bugger and therefore she hated him it was all very logical an amendment that had been recently inserted told her that james was contrary to former information not a nasty bugger therefore she couldnthate him according to previous records lily had been informed that james was arrogant and thrived on humiliating others therefore she had no right to enjoy his company an amendment that had been recently inserted told her that james was actually a very caring and pleasant person therefore she was completely free to enjoy his company as much as she liked according to previous records lily had been informed that james had an immense sense of pride and ego and this was the reason he had not given up on her all these years an amendment that had been recently inserted told her that james pride was in fact non existent reasoning sources suggested that this was probably because she had been so wretched to him all these years therefore he couldnthave persisted shamelessly to save his own face why then why had he not given up why had he not tried to save himself at least some of his pride why had he stuck it through all her hysterical tantrums and frosty glares and life threatening hexes maybe and it was a long shot but maybe he had been genuine maybe it had been like he d been telling her all this time maybe he did love her lily blinked and whereas before she had been watching james shyly out of the corners of her eyes she turned her head to look at him clearly everything in her head had clicked back into place in an entirely new arrangement and in this new arrangement everything made a lot more sense she could now explain why he d been so nice to her this past year she could now explain why he d been so nice to everyone else this past year moreover she could now explain why he hadntdecided that being nice to her was a complete waste of his time maybe he did love her in this new light lily thought james potter was something of a fantastic wizard he was her intellectual equal he cared about her well being more than anything else he had a habit of always saying the right thing when it really mattered he was the lucky owner of more than his fair share of charm and charisma and despite that dreadful temper of his it really was quite well placed and he had a sense of humour as well which lily was in all honesty quite glad of because she suspected that when someone you had loved for a long time and who had despised you for a long time finally wanted to apologise and be friends a sense of humour would definitely be a useful thing to have lily curled up in her chair her cheek resting against her knees still gazing at the head boy face when she finally closed her eyes in a bid to sleep all she could think about was the last thing she had seen before she slipped off into a doze the thing was lily used to think she had him all sorted out all in all he was the opposing team and her strategies and tactics were formulated on the target of beating his arse to a pulp it was just that she hadnteven realised when he d switched teams a n my week off school was fantastic so lovely and relaxing horrah i also got another chapter done as you

wakes up in a considerably more comfortable position than she went to sleep in the window panes of hogwarts get a right rattling all those flashes take their toll on sirius mental health lots of luff your back to school tomorrow author twelve smile for the camera it was at about ten past six the following morning when james woke up with a violent jolt from the most bizarre dream he d ever experienced he and lily had been practising quidditch on the hogwarts quidditch pitch getting along very well without any psychotic ex boyfriends fraudulent news articles or embarrassing bathroom entrances to ruin things yes they had been getting on famously when quite suddenly lily and her broomstick had begun to float away racking his brains james couldntsay exactly where she had been going it was in a generally away direction but when he had tried to follow her he found himself drifting towards the ground next moment the dream had changed and he and the marauders had been sprinting full tilt down a secret corridor pursued by filch but in the back of his mind there had been this panicked wretched thought that cried lily has floated away sitting up and looking about him james discovered that he was in the hospital wing and that lily had not in fact floated away but was curled up in the chair next to his bed sleeping with her head on her knees and her quidditch uniform still on even her arm pads of course she hadntsnogged padfoot james thought to himself sirius was someone who lily filed under the group title kill before kiss along with amos diggory snape and well himself even so the head boy couldntstop himself from reaching over and gently pushing her hair back from her face when it tinkled he saw her chain was still grasped in the fingers of his other hand the clasp broken oh well it gave him an excuse to buy her another one james always looked on the bright side he set the chain down on the hospital bed table and scrambled up from the bed lily squirmed in her sleep as he picked her up by under her back and her knees and put her down carefully on the mattress taking off her arm and shin pads while he was at it lily struggled all the way and james had to avert his face to stop his eyes getting poked out at one point but once she was safely laid on the bed and james was collapsed on the chair she made a little satisfied sighing noise and clawed at one of the pillows hugging it to her cheek james sighed as well taking off his glasses and pinching the bridge of his nose sleepily across the room the curtains of the hospital wing drew back automatically and the stark white room suddenly went a faint yellowish colour from the early morning sunlight james watched the dozing redhead wistfully until she began to stir lily woke in a much more comfortable position than she had gone to sleep in her legs didntseemed cramped anymore and her head was laid on something soft she slowly identified this thing as a pillow which was a definite improvement on her knees the odd thing was the pillow she was lying on smelt of something familiar it was nice but stuck out in her mind snuggling into it happily she tried to think what it was the poor pillow went flying when lily suddenly realised what it reminded her of sitting up as fast as the mechanism of a mouse trap lily wondered in incredulousness why in the world of magic she would be sleeping on a pillow that smelt just like james hair she squinted in the sunlight through the window and located herself as being in the hospital wing and james as being in the chair beside the bed she was currently on he smiled at her lopsidedly morning he said cheerfully lily blinked and looked back down at the white sheets that creased under her hands she would have said good morning back but somehow she couldntbring herself to do it it was odd when she had only just seen him and she couldntthink of anything horrid that used to jump into her head when she usually caught sight of him before last night all that she could have related his face to was the reasons as to how much she hated him now there was nothing there all the space that had been previously filled with bad memories was taken up only by the sight of his present lopsided smile james tipped his head sideways are you all right lilo he asked frowning slightly she hadnteven realised when he d switched teams lily looked up and said something she hadntmeant to you switched yeah you looked a bit squashed in the chair and i thought it was only fair since i was awake and after i broke your necklace and everything lily wasntsure whether she was glad or slightly disappointed that he d taken it the wrong way that charming smile of his was still stuck in her head as she stared thoughtfully at the white sheets a series of memories of that same smile flashed across her mind eye as if they were on a film projector it was the same smile that he d flashed outside the horseless carriages after he d kissed her hand it was the same one he had on his face after their first quidditch match and he d kissed her outside the heads dorms lily remembered it from when he d carried her up her stairs and put her to bed when they d gone outside that night on christmas day and from when she d unwrapped the broomstick he gave the next morning she hadntnoticed it at the time but every time she d let him be especially nice to her every time she d humoured him or every time she d shown him the slightest kindness he d flashed her that charming half smile as if he were half shy or half embarrassed or half afraid that she d curse him james was very confused lily was acting most strangely kind of thoughtfully really she d look at him as if she wanted to say something for a few moments then she d look back down at the mattress and finger the sheets until she looked up again it was like that way she d act with verity or remus but somehow shyer lily had never been shy with james potter before nor had she ever been friendly lilo are you sure you re all right lily looked up again and stopped fiddling with the sheets as she watched his eyes flicker and a crease form down his forehead for the life of her she couldntthink of what to say it nothing she said quietly james frown deepened wordlessly he stood up and sat down again on the hospital bed next to her then he fixed her with a stare as thick as swamp water lily averted her gaze nervously wondering what she could possibly say to him or indeed if she could say anything to him at all james gave up if he had learnt anything about lily it was that if she didntwant to talk to you you wouldnthear the sound of her voice again for a long time fine fine he said raising his eyebrows in a shrug like expression you donthave to tell me but at least give me a hug he teased holding out his arms three seconds later he decided there was something very very wrong with the head girl the lily he knew would have cast an irritated look in his general direction and said something along the lines of shove off shove off and drop dead potter but she didntsay anything she just looked down again and leaned towards him and james was so shocked it was a moment before he realised he was supposed to do the same thing and that was how the whole hug idea worked wondering at his good luck james leaned over but recoiled sharply when he felt a pain on his chest lily pulled back too giving him an odd look ouch frowned james in confusion and pulled up the shirt of his quidditch uniform lily would you happen to have any idea about this lily cringed as the absence of shirt revealed a rather large red mark in an interesting shape on the head boy chest already starting to bruise outwards from the inside er yes that may have been me she admitted blimey you must hit me a lot if i canteven keep track of them marvelled james with a smile no you were unconscious lily informed him so i irritate you even when comatose remarked james amused nice no it was just sirius said lily shaking her head and trying to think of something she could change the subject to so i got battered for something he did james said mockingly scandalised no no lily said waving her hands at the same time as shaking her head oh good grief she was going to have to explain what happened was sirius told me that you mentioned the mouth to mouth incident to him james bit his lip ah he said with a single worried nod yes said lily hoping this conversation would not go too far so i hit you a lot and apparently caused extensive internal bleeding i see james said in a monotone that tried valiantly to cover up his bewilderment it was fantastic not to be beaten by neither fist nor wand but this didntmake sense at all so what happened then i feel as if i have somehow missed out on a vital chapter of my life i er cantremember lily said and her voice sounded so blatantly untrue in her own ears that she sighed alright sirius asked me what exactly i hated about you she mumbled to the space of white sheet between them oh what a tremendous speech you must have made grinned james what a vastly monstrous list you must have had to complain about you know frankly i surprised you re not still rattling on about it now that was when lily hit him with the most determined stare straight in the eye and said in the most earnest voice she d ever used potter i couldntthink of anything at all if james hadntalready been sitting down he would have needed to i he began but didntfinish you i mean er pardon lily went back to staring at the sheets as her nerve failed her i said i couldntthink of anything she repeated downwards nothing at all ok my mind went completely blank james continued to stare as the small redhead voice began to crack there wasntanything james there was absolutely nothing to justify how i acted towards you this year nothing to excuse how bossy moody irritable angry ghastly mean and downright nasty i have been to you lily sniffed and dragged her palm across her cheek nothing at all she finished miserably james blinked this was it this was what he d been waiting for what he d been waiting for for all of three years three years he d wanted this or at least he had supposed so it wasntas if he didntstill love lily when he tried to trace back to where exactly he had fallen in love with her his mind only came up with that day by the lake where she had stood up for someone under his cruelty albeit someone who deserved it where she had frowned on the behaviour that he had been so proud of and where she degraded him down to below the level of a giant freshwater mollusc ever since that day he had been dreaming of some sort of recognition some sort of small sign of approval little by little he forgot that he was supposed to be the most popular boy at hogwarts he forgot that he was supposed to be arrogant and rude and self important he forgot that at least fifteen girls whistled stared or flirted while he walked the stretch of one corridor he forgot he was allowed to curse people and make fun of their weaknesses because he could get away with it somehow he even forgot he was tall and handsome fearless and talented heroic and sportingly able because as long as lily didntspeak to him he stopped telling himself he was all those things and as long as lily didntthink he was all those things he somehow stopped believing them himself so essentially ever since the day of snivellus pants he had been waiting for this kind of recognition only now it somehow did not taste as sweet as he had imagined what with lily crying and all if all of these events had transpired two years ago when james had not forgotten all those things he probably would have been jumping from one hospital bed to another and shooting sparks up in the air with joy at his triumph however these events were transpiring two years later when a lot had changed and at that moment all james wanted to do was give lily her cuddle quite suddenly lily found one hand one way round her shoulders and another the other way round then she found herself being pulled towards the head boy into one of his very best very tightest very heartfelt hugs where it seemed to her a little like being bundled up in a lovely thick duvet sniffing and smiling slightly despite herself lily closed her eyes and curled her arms into her chest because james had caught her whilst she was trying to dab both eyes at once james smell reminded her faintly of toasted chestnuts and brandy it was quite a long hug exactly how long they stayed there neither of them cared to say all james cared about was that lily was upset and all lily cared about was that james was giving her a hug after a while of lily sniffing and wiping her eyes on the backs of her forefingers james said dontcry lily sniffed defiantly i am not crying even so she took the hanky that he offered her when he pulled away reluctantly haventyou already got one of my hankies smiled james i shall run out soon lily laughed quietly through her nose leaning against the headboard of the bed in a teary good natured sulk and threw the balled up handkerchief back at its owner james seemed not to be too bothered that she had been wretched to him and unfairly but then again that made perfect sense he had never been bothered before so why start now even so lily felt the low bubbling thickness of guilt in her bottom of her stomach as she leant her elbows on her bent knees and fiddled with her nails james only watched her through the filter of the early morning sunlight it was a bit of a fantastic feeling knowing that the girl opposite him didntdetest him so much anymore after a while she looked up from her fiddling was i very horrid to you she asked in badly projected casualness james wrinkled his nose in dismissal nah lily raised her eyebrows in disbelief i was there she reminded him ruefully he smiled and gave a long continuous shrug maybe he told her all right yes but i did deserve it lily went back to her fiddling but it was slower as she shook her head in the negative no she murmured to her fingers you changed you changed quite a bit james only watched her you switched teams lily whispered pardon nothing james took a deep breath so are we friends he asked hopefully lily looked at him nervous i dontknow she said are we lilo said james seriously my invitation of friendship has always been yours you ve just never taken it symbolically holding out his hand to her james tried but failed to stop himself grinning manically when lily crawled forward to take it throwing all personal restraint out of the window james rushed forwards to hug her squeezing her so hard that lily was thinking with any luck she d come out of it taller she clutched at his neck actually quite enjoying being hugged to the death by james so we are friends then she said through a smile her forehead squashed against his cheek i should say so yes james replied we are friends friends he thought which was definitely the furthest he and lily were ever going to get friends is quite enough potter he told himself you may be in love with her but it d be downright stupid to ruin this for merlin sake get a grip and dontsend everything down the drain now just friends just friends just friends over the next twenty seconds or so james found it increasingly difficult to keep repeating these words to himself over and over again the reason for this could have been because the redhead in his embrace had raised her head and by some convenient arrangement had ended up with her face around two inches away from his yes things looked quite different from this point of view it seemed words had failed them both james swallowed nervously while he watched lily eyelashes flicker as they skipped from his own eyes to what could possibly have been his lip as words began to fail james so did the ability to think logically all consequences and foresight abandoned him as his lips drifted down towards hers bang it is common when one is not thinking to their full capacity for many things to be left up to instinctive reaction instinct told james that to kiss lily would be very dangerous and therefore when he heard the doors to the hospital wing burst open with a thunderous bump instinct made him startled to the core the noise made him jump release lily faster than the tail of a basilisk and tumble off the hospital wing bed with shock in that order lily meanwhile seemed to be attempting to collect herself and was blinking in a stunned way as the rest of the marauders plus verity dashed across the room to where james was scrambling up from the white tiles the newly arrived party looked as if they had run a good long way but james hardly noticed this because he was still trying to work out whether or not the last twenty seconds had actually happened had he and lily really suddenly gone from being in the shaky stages of a new friendship to being on the verge of kissing or was james brain misfiring from being unconscious all night however another demand on the head boy attention presented itself when remus bent over leaning on the arm of the beside chair and tried to stop panting by merlin he gasped as peter looked as though he was moments away from collapse by merlin do we have huge news for you two why were you on the floor just now prongs james stared because i was just about to kiss the love of my life the gorgeous girl you see before you who has just told me i have been redeemed fantastically in her eyes and wants to be friends but maybe sort of was just about to kiss me back he thought no reason he said aloud nevermind that verity dismissed impatiently you honestly wontbelieve it honest to anything you wont by the slightly panicked tone of her friend voice lily was just beginning to worry when she noticed that last marauder sirius crouched on the floor of the hospital wing in the corner furthest away from any windows he was acting very peculiarly shooting shifty glances in all directions shielding his eyes both hands and muttering it crazier than setting up a tent on the gringotts cart tracks verity continued waving her arms about it ludicrousness on paper it well look a heavy piece of parchment landed on the bed in front of lily it was an edition of hogwarts hearsay far out into the forbidden forest a flock of birds took their startled flight at the sound of the loudest scream ever to have graced hogwarts castle in all of its millennium of existence windowpanes in the hospital wing rattled let it simply be said that lily had ample grounds on which to be screaming for instead of the newsletter being filled from top to bottom in print the entire top half was taken up by a photograph this photograph featured lily it also featured is that snape demanded james his eye wide in horror and are you kissing indeed they were and under the photograph was the following article hogwarts hearsay issue 3 volume 1 thursday 29th april fraternising with the enemy this photograph was snapped recently in the dead of night and as you may have guessed shows our own head girl lily evans in quite busy circumstances with a member of the slytherin quidditch team severus snape after her initiation in the gryffindor quidditch team early this school year miss evans has seemingly been leading quite the scandalous life along with allegations that she was dumped by her long term boyfriend amos diggory after being caught snogging her fellow head student james potter there were then rumours that she had offered to sabotage one of gryffindor matches in order to save hufflepuff and win mr diggory back now is seems she has been becoming quite familiar with gryffindor next opponents the slytherins mr snape pictured known throughout the school for being somewhat antisocial is here seen acting a great deal friendlier than usual toward the gryffindor seeker of course mr snape is also known for his long term rivalry with james potter who also coincidently has a long term rivalry with a certain mr diggory from hufflepuff students of hogwarts may be seeing a trend in miss evans romantic dealings and could be forgiven for thinking that the head girl wishes to deliberately spite mr potter we at hogwarts hearsay again implore mr potter to rethink his blatant affections for the head girl because she is obviously nothing but an evil little slut and is only out to calculatingly hurt him let face it why else would someone voluntarily snog snape after running her throat dry with screaming lily had pulled her knees up on top of the mattress and had scrambled away from the piece of parchment as far as the bed headboard the sheets crumpling beneath her clawing feet i dontbelieve it she was muttering how could this happen why would this happen what did i ever do to deserve this that photo is like feeding skelegrow to a jellyfish remarked verity it is physically morally and aesthetically wrong in a motion that was startlingly quick lily seized james arm so that he had to bend down to avoid falling over please oh merlin please for the love of all things magic lily begged him take it away and burn it that wontdo much good i afraid remus said sympathetically yeah she been sticking them up at night peter added they re everywhere lily emitted something that sounded a bit like the dying scream of a dormouse james who predicted by the grip she had on his arm that he wasntgoing anywhere soon neither would he have any inclination to sat down on the mattress next to her shh lilo it ok nobody would believe it if you paid them to he said quietly using his free arm to reach across and hold her other shoulder but it there lily cried in horror look at it it hideous how did she do that verity frowned come to think of it how did she do that the blonde said picking up the parchment from the mattress and scrutinizing it thoughtfully oh there are various potions and charms and things you can do to make people in photos do whatever you like remus said but i dontknow the thing is when have you or i ever seen skeeter with a camera that what the thing is james said looking up from the head girl for a brief moment that true remus nodded sitting down on lily other side most of the magic is very complicated and anyone who wants to carry it out has to be very experienced with cameras and all that photographic business somehow skeeter the scarab doesntquite strike me as the sort of person who would spend two years researching the finer points of photography what does that mean then asked peter it means that the scarab is no longer working alone verity replied disgustedly she held up the article and made to tear it straight down the middle for her best friend benefit but lily looked up at the photograph and frowned wait she exclaimed snatching the parchment from verity look no thanks james wrinkled his nose and averted his eyes no here lily said pointing the photograph contained both the head girl and snape both in their respective quidditch uniforms and as mentioned their two photographic selves were kissing quite passionately james had to fight hard not to heave with horror or disgust or both lily was pointing to the neck of herself in the photo around it was the necklace that was currently lying on the beside table with the clasp snapped however the necklace was doing something very strange it seemed to be floating against gravity because the chain was halfway up lily neck and the clasp looked as if it was being held up by an invisible string from behind the redhead it was also shaking slightly as if someone was fiddling with the invisible string i know when this person took my photograph lily exclaimed it was when you were trying to fix my necklace potter right after sirius and i were talking in the changing rooms they must have cut you out but left my necklace in oh yeah james said slowly that explains why sirius was saying he was seeing lily began but trailed off to lean sideways peering around verity to see sirius everyone in the hospital wing turned to look at the marauder who had not said anything well anything completely coherent in the past fifteen minutes he was still crouched in the corner of the room with his head bent slightly and his hands on either side of his face flashes he was mumbling flashes mumble mumble flashes are everywhere mumble stay away from the light lily narrowed her eyes and looked sideways at remus is he alright she asked in a low voice he been like that ever since last night remus told the party didntsleep a wink avoids windows like he avoids the library and wontstop muttering long enough to tell me what wrong he asked me about these flashes last night as well verity asked do you think someone been taking photos of him then that ll probably be it nodded remus grimly so james said someone been taking photos of him and someone been taking photos of you chances are it the same person right right lily assented so this is what i suggest james continued i dontknow about you but i need a shower lily nodded glumly so we ll all go to our dorm and work out what to do from there alright lily nodded again and stood up drifting slowly towards the door half way across the room james put an arm around her because she looked so miserable hey he said quietly to her and kissed the top of her head cheer up i think i have an idea about what to do behind them verity abruptly stopped walking when her best friend neither cursed hit nor shouted at the head boy nor did she get even remotely angry verity and remus looked at each other with identical expressions of shock come on padfoot james said walking over to the boy and bending down to pick him up by the back of his collar oh merlin the flashes the flashes are everywhere sirius continued to mutter as he was half dragged scrambling towards the doors oh pull yourself together man james told him levelly we re going to catch whoever did this to you and possibly prank them quite abruptly sirius stopped muttering prank he asked looking up at his best friend james stopped pulling him along by the back of his shirt yes he said deliberately prank oh sirius said standing up and dusting himself down alright then he nodded cheerfully before walking quite normally out the door a n so after two weeks of pure no time to write ness here is something i scraped together during lunch hours

time of it as for james and his chronically unconscious state he must have low blood pressure or something or maybe the thought of lily kissing someone else his best friend was so shocking that even

activity for rita skeeter love your no time to put pen to paper author thirteen conspiracy in the ranks the walk back to the heads dorms flew right by for james this was probably because for the entire way back there was only a single train of thought in his head it was the following lily doesnthate me anymore lily wants to be my friend lily might possibly like me lily is at this moment walking next to me with my arm around her she and i are united in our front against skeeter the scarab she and i are on the same team and then they were in front of the gold rimmed panels of the double door loopy loo someone said by now the password had travelled around all their small group and rumour had it that a first year knew but was only telling people for a fee of fifteen galleons they really must change it soon james thought soon after arriving james went to his dorm to change lily went into the bathroom to take a shower and as soon as both doors closed remus and verity turned to each other with mouths as wide as a hippogiff wing span you saw that didntyou verity demanded of the boy you saw that too or i am going downright crackers i saw it but i dontbelieve it remus said shaking his head after the two heads dontbelieve what sirius said leisurely from where he had flopped down onto the sofa he had his arm around her verity exclaimed ignoring sirius she was leaning against him he kissed her face in various places at least three times and she hit him a grand total of never this doesntmake sense verity was waving her arms around remus was worried she was going to start hyperventilating what doesntmake sense sirius asked again wondering if there was any breakfast to be had remus gave him a look and steered verity towards the sofa look sit down before you hurt yourself he told her parking her next to sirius and sitting down on her other side what were they like the last time you saw them well verity said clasping her hands in her lap james was unconscious and lily was beating all the remaining life out of him because she found out that he d told sirius about their little kissing incident over christmas i see said remus i can imagine how the scene then and the scene now would feel a little disjointed no stuff happened after that sirius told them finally working out what they were going on about we asked lilo what exactly she hated about james then we left oh asked remus and what did she say nothing verity told him shaking her head yeah she just sort of stared into space for a minute like she was listening to quidditch on the wireless remus made a low humming noise as if the inner workings of his brain had started to operate at a higher frequency perhaps he said she couldntthink of anything to say everyone in the room pondered this statement for a moment that would explain why she didntsay anything peter nodded under the impression that he was actually contributing something useful to the discussion it seems to me remus continued a smile growing on his face that our good friend the head girl has had an epiphany a what now sirius asked a wake up call said remus in a low voice verity hand flew to her mouth no she said shrewdly you dontthink she not you dontthink at last i think so nodded remus in the direction of the bathroom it would explain why she hasntkilled him in the last two hours oh my good green beans verity said stressing every single word of her exclamation this is i dontbelieve it she stood up and jumped up and down a little eyes wide and hair bristling with excitement they re going to get together at last lily going to give him a chance they ll be so happy they ll probably get married good grief what am i going to wear to the wedding james will stop moping every time someone mentions lily sirius in a voice just as excited as verity hair merlin she ll finally make him happy never mind what you re going to wear to the wedding what am i going to wear to the wedding shhhhh remus shushed them both standing up to shake his hands up and down sirius and verity looked at him as if he were mad not to join in their celebration look remus said think about it if we confront them at the same time chances are they ll get embarrassed say they re just friends and deny anything will happen leading to nothing happening if we talk to them individually there more chance of them telling us what they really feel so you take her he gestured to verity and we ll take him and report back in the morning all right sirius saluted yes sir he nodded well done moony that using the ol noodle ok so we have to act natural verity said whispering for some reason we dontsay anything about anything until we get each of them on their own act like we haventnoticed a thing savvy she gave an especially long hard look at peter who could not even be trusted with the gryffindor password at the best of times they all nodded conspiratorially and sat down too excited to talk about anything trivial such as the weather or next month quidditch match against slytherin every so often verity would give a little thrilled bounce of happiness or remus and sirius would give each other satisfied looks all four of them jumped when the head boy door opened and james himself stepped out smiling at his friends he crossed the room and gave the bathroom door a light knock coming coming came lily voice from inside followed swiftly by her presence damp haired unbelievable she grumbled no one yet been in there and the hot water still runs out there was a moment of silence as the five of them looked at each other five pairs of eyes flicked about either expectantly or elatedly either waiting for something to be said or itching to say something it was an odd moment of pure bizarreness peter little finger began to twitch remus coughed so exclaimed sirius clapping his hands and rubbing them together what this i hear about a prank then eh could you perhaps tell me sirius asked shivering why this is necessary again oh stop complaining padfoot remus hissed at him hidden behind the doorway of the gryffindor changing rooms you were the keenest one out of all of us fair play i was keen to pull a prank or two sirius whispered back but could you tell me why in the name of all things magic i am out here in nothing but a pair of trousers when it is only april sirius wasntexaggerating he was indeed standing outside the gryffindor changing rooms in only his trousers without any type of shirt on and it was indeed the end of april remus was as mentioned out of sight in the doorway of the changing rooms lily and verity were perched on the roof and james was crouching under the shelter of the nearest stretch of the stands everyone was waiting the object of this exercise was quite obviously bait logically if sirius was prone to being photographed then sticking him in a quidditch pitch partially clothed was likely to lure the photographer into being caught it was genius really james thought as he peered out from behind the red and gold coloured cloth that adorned the stands come on padfoot he hissed we haventgot all year sirius pulled a pained look and took a deep breath standing up straighter he stretched his arms above his head and said in a very loud deliberate voice oh what a marvellous day spring is truly here the sun is shining the birds are singing the fairies are fairy ing verity sniggered while remus face took on an expression halfway between pain and amusement what i would not give sirius continued gamely spreading his arms out in a romantically dramatic fashion for someone to come along and capture this fantastic moment by this time both girls above were fighting not to burst into laughter lily felt as if she were about to collapse onto the flat roof of the changing rooms that they were crouched on oh merlin alive look at him verity struggled to say he looks like he should be in a badly written play the sta a ands are ali i i i ve lily sang through her giggles with the sound of mu u usic however it seemed as if sirius performance had done little more than to amuse the girls on the roof there had been nothing in the way of paparazzi type behaviour from anywhere and remus and james had been trying very hard to spot anything sirius turned in james direction and shrugged that when it happened a tiny burst of light flashed from the opposite end of the stands lasting only a millisecond it was a burst of light that looked suspiciously like the flash of a camera there lily shouted spotting it first and james followed her pointing finger swiftly to an area in the stands where he saw the faintest flicker of movement like charging hippogriffs james and remus tore off towards where lily had pointed while the head girl and her best friend began to climb down from the roof as fast as they could sirius on the other hand sprinted into the changing rooms and emerged a moment later starting after the girls whilst simultaneously attempting to pull a t shirt over his head glimpses of their target through the wooden beams of the stands became more and more frequent to james the further he ran it seemed to be someone quite short and blonde by the looks of it who was sprinting desperately on the other side of the stands to him at the nearest break in the structure james crossed to the other side and was faced with a running view of a small girl running for her life while a rather large camera swung wildly to and fro from her arm james was suddenly struck with an idea stopping his sprint he planted his feet on the ground and pulled out his wand pointing it squarely at a decorative cloth that was draped over the nearby slytherin sector of the stands wingardium leviosa he commanded and a slytherin banner about three times the size of a double duvet cover slid swiftly off the wooden beams and flew straight towards the fugitive surrounding her and collapsing on her in a jumble of green and silver cloth whoever she was she was still trying unsuccessfully to free herself from the tangle of the banner when the three marauders lily and verity arrived next to it puffing from their sprint muffled swear words only just came through from the pile of heavy cloth and the seventh years glanced at each other as finally a head protruded from the banner my my such language from one so young remus commented i think we should book her an appointment with a bottle of miss skower dontyou asked james crossing his arm and tilting his head to the side this stance was authoritative and lily noted quite attractive let me out you insert double expletive here growled the small blonde girl from her prison whom lily had recognised as rita skeeter younger sister what was her name again alice anna annabelle my sister made me do it she threatened me she caused me bodily harm let me out oh we guessed that lily told her wrinkling her nose combination of factors really one being that your detestable sister has never been seen within six meters of any photographic equipment whatsoever another being that you re kind of small and easy to influence shut up the girl snarled indignantly i am not easy to influence that not my experience sirius said wryly clearly you ve been influenced by my manly stature and rugged good looks and although i hardly blame you let face it arentyou like eleven yes speaking of which why in the name of magic are you stalking sirius asked remus well duh he fit the skeeter girl said as if remus were dense and causing sirius to nod smugly at the crowd in general do you know how much money there is to be made from photos of the popular at this school really asked sirius sounding intrigued what kind of money would you be talking about sirius lily exclaimed sorry he muttered quickly yeah stalking photographs emotional trauma right got it exactly nodded lily good boy unfortunately the blonde in the banner had managed to free an arm from the jumble and was now waving it around and pointing at things while she shouted at the seventh years you ve got nothing she yelled gleefully nothing you hear you ll never take me alive never dearie me verity remarked looking at her friends appalled whatever would your mother say about this in an instant the girl went from a look of almost maniacal joy to trembling panic oh merlin she muttered quietly you canttell my mother you can t you dontunderstand she worse than grindelwald she ll dismantle my camera and tie the pieces to my facial features with wire really frowned james well no but as good as muttered the blonde she ll probably be very angry and confiscate my camera it seemed over statement ran in the skeeter bloodline the seventh years looked at each other here was a way of bringing down the smaller of their foes wait hold on lily said to the gryffindors spreading her fingers in the discovery of a marvellous idea look anna is it anita the girl said poisonously right anita lily said half apologetically listen you dont like your sister much do you what demanded anita of course not i think she a puffed up social reject who takes out all her angst on innocent bystanders with that sad case newsletter of hers because she too ugly mean and thick to get a date with him she motioned at james yeah that good nodded lily thoughtfully while verity gave a small round of applause it wasntclear whether she was talking about anita reaction or her last comment about her sister ok anita how this for a deal lily continued we carefully omit any mention of this little incident to you mum and in return you help us in our plan to bring down your nitty cruddy half baked spineless dung faced cow of a sister get stuffed growled anita giving her standard reply to any sort of deal she was offered nowadays oi james said outraged if your not careful skeeter i ll confiscate your camera myself he stepped forward but found lily hand on his chest her touch confiscated a beat from his heart just just calm ok lily said soothingly to the situation in general anita this is the best deal you re getting all we need is a little help from you in which you get your little first year friends together and do some errands for us this way you get to keep your camera and we get to give your sister what she rightly deserves it a win win situation there was a moment of silence while anita considered this proposal the marauders and verity confided among themselves with looks already lily plan was beginning to sound good fair enough anita nodded lily smiled brilliant she said now let get you out of that carpet green and silver should never be forced on anyone rita skeeter was having the best day of her life considering how shallow and relatively meaningless her life was this was not much of an achievement but it was sadly the best day of rita life hogwarts hearsay had spread through the school like a magical form of the plague the one hundred and fifty copies she had posted around the school had all vanished from the wall within three hours of release and had obviously been duplicated and duplicated over and over again until absolutely everyone in the castle had seen it the image was everywhere and wherever she went rita heard people whispering about it how do you think she got the photo could it possibly be true i never would have guessed it i reckon it a load of bollocks personally is lily evans necklace floating people were actually coming up to her and offering their congratulations admittedly they were only fellow members of the james potter appreciation society whose member base was in the vast majority both hufflepuff and female but this hardly mattered the most reaction rita had ever gotten from any of her articles before had been an inkbottle thrown at her in advanced divination any moment now she told herself sitting in the ravenclaw common room she was at one of the many studying tables but instead of doing her charms homework she was doodling things such as the design of her wedding dress and listing songs to be played at the reception a running theme throughout her doodlings was little hearts with the letters rs and jp any moment now james potter would walk into the common room how he would know the password presented a slight continuity error in her daydreaming stride over to her snog her passionately like characters did in romance novels and say something along the lines of oh beautiful marvellous radiant lovely rita after you cleverly exposed that devious evans scandalous dealings with that detestable villain snape i have seen the monstrous error of my ways and now my heart belongs to you and only to you marry me my darling and let me give you a life of workless worriless luxury with the help of my huge personal fortune any moment now the entrance to the ravenclaw common room opened yes rita shouted passionately flinging her arms out and waiting for james potter to propose undying love everyone in the room including the person who had just entered not james potter but some ginger first year stared at her with expressions of mild shock or greater annoyance fuming in defiant grumpiness rita sat back down again and resumed her doodling when someone tapped her on the shoulder she jumped and quickly rolled up her parchment jerking her head from side to side before coughing into a pout and adjusting her hair with her middle finger what she demanded of the startled looking first year who had only just entered the girl orange hair puffed slightly as she mumbled excuse me rita skeeter she said seeming as though her was reciting lines for a play i think you were right about what you annoying little ginger rita said nastily about lily evans and severus snape i rita said speechless i was wordlessly the first year pointed at the exit and without waiting for further information rita lunged in that direction right she thought right did this mean evans and snape were really snogging passionately in some broom cupboard somewhere oh this was too marvellous to be true if her stories were in fact correct there was no way james potter would not abandon his pathetic thing for evans and ask her out instead it was after about fifteen seconds of running that rita realised that she didnthave a clue where she was going breathing out through her nose in anger she slowed to a stop and looked around she thought of going back to the common room to extract more information from the ginger but a moment later she heard something that would save her the trouble two other first years were whispering on a stone bench to her left their heads bent behind copies of hogwarts hearsay creeping closer rita strained to hear what they were saying actually i think rita is completely right a straight haired boy was saying loudly making rita eavesdropping job rather easy of course nodded his curly hair companion glancing oddly at rita every so often didntyou just see them lily evans and severus snape just went past here together only a minute ago and without rita even having to ask the boys pointed their forefingers further down the corridor in bizarre wordless unison however rita didntnotice this but instead grinned and scurried off in the direction of their fingers when she came to one of the large shafts of moving staircases she found she didntknow where to go next cursing she looked hard for any sign of that stupid head girl with her ridiculous hair and her creepy new boyfriend however the noisy shifting staircases presented no more than irrelevant students did you see them they went up that staircase just now lily evans and that weird bloke from slytherin rita spun round and found a small freckled girl talking animatedly to another boy over the crook of a staircase or at least the girl was talking animatedly enough for rita to hear of course i saw them the boy replied by their ties they were both in gryffindor but could not have been higher than second years and of course i happened to note where they were going sixth floor south east corridor it was would you like me to tell you again sixth floor south east corridor once again rita did not notice the two younger student watching her slyly because she was too busy riding a moving staircase from floor to floor making her swinging way towards the south east corridor on the sixth floor arriving there quite out of breath rita almost tripped on someone sat just inside the beginning of the corridor it was a first year girl from her own house and as rita gathered herself and prepared to tell the girl off for almost sending her flying she noticed that the girl was talking into what looked like a hand held mirror it might have seemed a little odd that the small girl did not even look up at almost being tripped on but continued talking to whomever was in the mirror needless to say rita stepped back and tried inconspicuously to listen to the conversation yes they passed this way bout thirty second ago i would say rita huffed this was no help well then they went straight on down this corridor turned right at the statue of barbara the bearded carried on until the third left along that corridor with portraits of past heads and took a left when they came to gordon de shedding headmaster from 1523 to 1601 if rita had not shot off to follow the directions and waited for a reply from the person in the mirror she may have noticed that the first year was talking to a certain head boy who a few seconds after the little first year girl had finished her speech said did it work yeah i think so nodded the ravenclaw glancing at the retreating form of rita as she skidded turning right at the corner she on her way now brilliant grinned the image of james in the mirror next time there a hogsmeade trip i ll bring you all back a bag of honeydukes pick n mix on me for your trouble spread the word oh wow cheers smiled the girl getting up from the floor but i think we re all just happy to help you bring down that mean old slag excuse my mermish mr potter far from cursing rita was congratulating herself on a job well done as she took the third left and ran along the long line of portraits on the wall she told herself that it would not be long until james potter himself was taking her out to hogsmeade and lily evans was the laughing stock and social outcast of the school at last respect and popularity would be hers rita couldntresist a small snigger as she stumbled to a stop in front of gordon de shedding headmaster 1523 1601 the man in the portrait was a very round sort of figure with a circular red nose and a purple velvet pointed hat that drooped down to his elbows rita looked him up and down yes that me he nodded gordon de shedding headmaster from 1523 to 1601 that gordon de shedding headmaster from 1523 to 1601 a lot of people seem to be taking a left when they get to my portrait i see sniffed rita and would these people happen to have absurdly coloured red hair and be accompanied by the ugliest boy alive gordon de shedding averted his eyes in dismissal i thought her hair was very nice rita congratulated herself on her interviewing skills and took a left as she hurriedly turned a corner into a transfiguration corridor she bumped into someone ah rita shouted in a tone of mild disgust as she eyed up her sister what the blazes are you doing here what asked anita affronted cantan innocent little first year take her innocent little first year type stroll rite snorted innocent little first year my arse she said now listen you insignificant louse you must have seen where evans and snape went i might have done anita said cryptically while absently fingering a lever on her camera fabulous replied rita sarcastically so if you donttell me where they went so help me merlin i ll all right all right anita quipped back she nodded to the door beside them rita examined it it was a relatively plain door compared to the majority of others at hogwarts made of simple pine the door had a silver plaque on it that read cleaning supplies above it someone probably the signed had written in a bad scrawl mr filch and below it keep out a maintenance cupboard summarised rita merlin i would have thought evans was classier than that you know what anita said getting into her role me too rita eyes flashed over her sister camera you she hissed grasping the straps of the camera around anita neck and very nearly strangling her sister you re coming with me this is likely to be the best scoop i ever make plus of course the best moment of my life after james potter proposes to me i need a photo of everything of course sister dearest anita smiled sweetly while thinking james potter propose to you you re off your rocker woman dragging her sister round to face the door rita took a deep breath this was it this was what all her hard work added up to smiling craftily she put one hand on the doorknob wrenched it open propelled herself and anita inside and slammed the door shut behind them there could be no escape for evans and snape now hello skeeter this was perhaps the last thing rita expected to hear upon entering the maintenance cupboard perhaps because it was not oh merlin severus someone found us or get out and shut the door this cupboard is taken also perhaps because it was not lily evan voice or severus snape voice she heard but james potter s a brief thought entered rita head that it may not be so bad to be stuck in a dark maintenance cupboard alone with james potter and she decided then to tell anita to get out and shut the door however she didnthave a chance because a moment later someone had clapped their hands twice and the candles in the cupboard lit up four candles in a relatively small space about the size of a tool shed was more than enough to illuminate not two people as rita had expected but five james potter lily evans sirius black verity hooch and remus lupin you screeched rita pointing a sharpened nail at lily you were supposed to be in here with severus snape remus and verity turned to james we ll be outside they left smirking at rita as the ravenclaw bristled in confusion the head girl put a hand on her hip and smiled at her now rita did you really believe that half the first year told me so along with a bloody portrait oh gosh yes lily said through her smile the candlelight shining in her eyes they were very helpful to us in acting as guides werentthey james yep cracking nodded james as entertaining as this is sirius interjected cheerfully i ll be getting some fresh air he winked at anita on his way to the door me too the younger skeeter said following sirius to the door rita was beginning to get angry this is ridiculous she spat i dontknow what you could ever see in this little tart james in case you hadntnoticed she hates you she completely wrong for you and she far from deserves you you ll never be together but you and i have a wonderful future james fought not to gag as lily was thinking hard she had to get rita away from the door if their plan was going to work merlin rita she said pityingly for a gossip queen you really arentwith the times are you what demanded rita who was by now really wanting to hit the head girl potter and i got together last week lily said snaking her hand through the crook of james elbow james looked down and tried to keep his heart rate steady he knew it was all part of the plan he knew lily was only trying to aggravate their enemy but that didntstop him enjoying the feeling of her clutching his arm to her and putting her cheek on his shoulder what rita repeated tilting her head forwards as a bull might before charging no actually yes james nodded i asked lilo out last week and she said yes it was partly your doing really yeah you see potter was just so nice to me about the awful things you wrote in your pathetic little newsletter lily told rita i guess your plan didntwork that well after all lily smiled wider as rita breathing got shallower and more ragged what the matter rita the head girl asked are you ashamed of losing to me ashamed of losing to someone with hair this colour or are just ashamed of losing to someone who was so sure to win rita let out a scream that sounded like fifty quidditch referees all blowing their whistles at the same time through a very long tunnel it was a scream that felt like it was thickening your blood and making your eardrums shrivel up in fright in that moment what rita wanted more than anything was to kill lily evans dismember her and stick all her body parts up like she was sticking up the new issue of hogwarts hearsay as rita lunged towards lily continuing her screaming lily and james stepped separate ways allowing the screeching ravenclaw to careen off behind them and crash into a pile of bottles containing various cleaning fluids smiling at each other they made for the door stepping out into the corridor and locking the door behind them when they turned around they found not only their friends but the entirety of the first year and a few others who were curious about what was going on well done everyone nodded lily that went as smoothly as anything you were brilliant now what anita asked obviously not impressed my dear accomplice james said do you honestly think we would go to all this trouble to lead your sister into a cleaning supplies cupboard without spending all of today preparing this cupboard a few of the first years glanced at each other in anticipation evans evans you utter cow let me out came the muffled sound of rita voice from the other side of the door let see remus said tapping his lower lip as there came the sound of rita banging on the door banging on the door makes the lights go out hey that not fair obviously rita was feeling the effects of the gryffindors preparation and the door handle started to jiggle as rita battled with it turning the handle sirius pointed out turns on the water jet charms there was a shriek from inside the cupboard and the carpet under the door began to turn dark with the soaking of water sniggers began to rise from the crowd gathered around the door five seconds later there was another louder shriek she must have gotten her wand out verity said understandingly doesntthat replace the water with pond algae nodded remus ahh urg alohamora ouch the alohamora charm lily cringed was that the one that releases the catches on the pixie cages asked james ah ah ah get off get off me get out from down my top you little freaks obviously yes remarked remus with a smile peskipiksi pesternomi casting any other charm sirius narrated for the benefit of the first years causes the nose to swell up and go turquoise from then on it seemed as though rita had a very bad cold from the sound of the things she was shouting gut of gut of she cried lut me out lut me out dis instunt you nasty fulthy bunch of little muggots argh the prisoner shouting ceased for a moment and the group outside the cupboard heard a faint hollow knocking of wood against wood oh i hope that her picking up a broom hissed verity excitedly makes feathers grow out of the ears remus said casually to the crowd bang bang bang whereas banging the broom on the door produces straightforward boils to the face and hands explained james urg it a bit old school but we thought we d pay tribute by this time the sniggers from the crowd of students were quickly turning into laughter i hope she sits down on a tin of paint soon sirius said that the one that puts troll mucus in your shoes which is the one that turns your hair into blue straw dreadlocks asked lily kicking a bucket in frustration remus said oh yeah that was a good one smiled james i wuntfuget dis yu ll ull be sowy wita skeeta wuntstand for dis kind of hoomiliashun should we let her out soon lily asked narrowing her eyes in thought yeah go on then nodded james and the crowd shifted in excitement alohamora remus commanded and the lock on the cupboard door clicked there quickly followed the sound of rita rushing forward and crashing into the door in a mad bid to get out as the door swung open rita squinted into the light coming in through the corridor she felt and looked utterly ridiculous the crowd assembled outside burst into thunderous laughter as rita took stock of the damage she was soaked through with water and a thick faintly green substance she was covered in algae and pond weeds and the bottom half of her vision was obstructed with the huge blueness of her nose the pixies still in the cupboard had a wad of her blonde hair between them and she was sure there were still two of them down her top her hair was blue and made of straw there were feathers coming out of her ears and boils on her face and hands she cringed as some kind of goo squelched out of her shoes as she stumbled forwards out of the doorframe everyone outside was laughing at her rita pulled a furious face as she tried to think of something cutting and dignified to say nothing came so she simply screamed at them all arrrgghhh lily smiled at the disgusting monstrosity that staggered out of the cupboard dealing out justice where it was due felt very very good silently she held her hand out to anita aw skeeter go on give us a smile james said from by her side yes rita lily said raising anita camera to her face smile for the camera rita grimaced as the flash went a n what better than a tub of haagen dazs and the soundtrack to moulin rouge not much i ll tell you that i very sorry but i have bad news lately my chem teacher has gotten a bit pissed off with us because we never do any

loo on their own well known law of nature lily recites the epic tale of one day in the life of someone who is a mate of james lots of luff your exhausted author fourteen a whole speech for nothing later that afternoon the marauders lily and verity were doing a bit of photojournalism of their very own once again pieces of parchment were stuck up all over the school they flapped from every bit of wall space the gryffindors could find they were stuck on classroom doors they decorated staircase banisters and they graced the backs of toilet cubicle doors lily stuck up another and smiled at the head boy beside her for perhaps the two hundredth time that day while they observed the contents of the parchment hogwarts hearsay issue 4 volume 1 saturday 1st may as many of the student population will know this publication since its beginning has always had a reputation for being far more fictitious than factual in its content however hogwarts hearsay is as of now under brand new management and therefore will not only be narrating the absolute truth but all images contained herein are completely genuine and have not been tampered with in any way having said that the editors would now like to share with you the following photograph underneath was the image they had captured only that morning it was rather brilliant james thought as he studied it it was of course a photograph of rita skeeter stumbling out of the maintenance cupboard on the sixth floor soaked in pond water covered in weeds and mucus with blue straw for hair boils adorning her face and feathers sprouting form her ears as the photographic ravenclaw swayed around in a rather drunken way a couple of pixies sniggered at her in the background and then either made a grab at her hair or flew up her skirt for those of you and we suspect there may be many who do not recognise the wretched creature in this photograph we can inform you that it is none other than this publication former author editor and producer rita skeeter skeeter was snapped around lunchtime today exiting one of mr filch cleaning supplies cupboards on the sixth floor in the sate pictured it seems that the former organiser of hogwarts hearsay has been the victim of an elaborate practical joke involving many students belonging to the first year and other residents of the hogwarts castle when asked to comment on her experience miss skeeter only released an incoherent wailing which some slytherin third years claim to have heard from the lower levels of the dungeons it is the authors professional opinion that miss skeeter may have been targeted in this way as a result of her continued slandering of a miss lily evans the current head girl we hope that miss skeeter has learnt the valuable lesson that miss evans has friends in both high and low places that will not hesitate to aid her or her reputation when in jeopardy photograph courtesy of the subject sister anita skeeter masterful james commented and lily hummed in agreement as the two of them continued on along the corridor already a little way down the corridor where they had come the hufflepuff quidditch team coming in from practice was milling around the notices displaying their efforts according to some second and third years they had met rita skeeter had been spotted making her erratic way back to the ravenclaw common room hiding behind statues and columns as much as possible with a stolen slytherin scarf wrapped around her head leaving a trail of feathers and troll mucus on her root lily who didntoften gloat felt a very strong inclination to at that moment james who had a very extensive history of gloating was holding up very well considering the circumstances it was when they reached the entrance hall that lily and james had run out of copies to put up being head boy has its perks james said as his wand flicked out of his cloak with a flourish and one of them is being able to do magic in the corridors lily held out their remaining parchment for him to duplicate diplo poli lily smiled as sheets of parchment appeared in her hands all with the fantastic photograph on them along with the article strangely enough she wasntreally smiling at the parchments she was smiling at james james was smiling back they seemed to be doing that a lot recently ever since the day before in the hospital wing one of them would say something they would smile and go on smiling for no other reason that the fact that they were smiling lily found that liked smiling at james after thinking for so many years that he didntdeserve it she also liked it when he smiled back at her this being another new discovery james on the other hand had always liked it when lily smiled at him therefore he smiled back which caused lily to smile at him which caused him to smile at her it was a vicious circle well actually it was quite a peaceful and amiable circle really unfortunately all this smiling rather distracted the head boy and girl from the level the parchment was reaching in lily arms this level was becoming very high indeed and lily only realised how many copies were mounting up when the pile reached the bottom of her chin and it suddenly occurred to her that her arms felt like they were being dislocated with the weight oh gosh she cried as her knees buckled whoa james yelled lunging forward to catch a clumsy hold of the pile fine incantatem ah lily commented in a flat voice struggling to support the papers hold on i ll get it james said catching a parchment that was sliding off the top with one hand while grappling at the bottom with the other wait it slipping over this side lily said making mad grabs for a bit in the middle of the pile that was threatening to slip out piles of parchment have a sly habit of dispersing every which way and they were making a good go at trying to escape the grasp of the two seventh years and submit to gravity for this reason both lily and james found themselves taking steps forwards towards each other to trap the various sections of parchment that were going various ways oh merlin sighed james this is so bloody typical personally i dontreally see how this can be salvaged agreed lily it then came to their attention that even with a heavy pile of parchment being prevented from falling only by the way it was wedged between them they really were standing quite close together if lily were to stand very still and look upwards her eyes would be exactly at the level of james chin moreover if james were to stand very still and look downward their eyes would be at an exact diagonal and interestingly so would their lips if lily were to stand on her tip toes and if james were to bend down only a little something slipped between them and lily gasped as all the parchments they had been holding dislodged themselves and cascaded spectacularly onto the floor at their feet both james and lily looked down in silence as the pile made a resounding slap on the flagstones followed by a riffling of paper as loose sheets of parchment swung to and fro floating down gently onto the floor james glanced up at lily but she still had her head bent and her eyes flicked to the side he watched her as she bopped down onto her knees and slowly began to gather up the sheets into a pile once james had bent down to help he noticed a blush flowering under her freckles for some reason neither of them remembered to use their wands stop blushing lily told herself furiously you are being utterly ridiculous what in the name of magic was going on lily evans hardly ever blushed especially not around boys she had never blushed because of diggory nor had she ever blushed around professor milo their fabulously good looking replacement professor who took over when one of the big christmas trees fell on professor flitwick in their fourth year she hadnteven blushed when she was served by that boy in the three broomsticks who had the most beautiful hair she had ever seen and had come over to her and verity table to put a pink snapdragon in her empty butterbeer bottle it was not that lily minded the red haze she felt creeping across her face but why did it have to be potter of all people they had only just become friends and now she was standing on her toes to snog him she didntknow why but the thought of kissing potter made her stomach feel like it was filling with an all singing all dancing cabaret of sock puppets feverishly she made extra haste in shuffling the copies together but stopped when she felt something on her hand it was another hand it was a hand attached to the rest of the head boy it was a strange feeling to have the coldness of the flagstone under her fingers and the warmth of james over her own sorry he said quietly but he didntmove his hand lily didntreally know what he was sorry for but found that she didntreally care all that much it all right she replied james then did the oddest thing he opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something then he closed it as if he had suddenly thought better this was most uncharacteristic lily had never known of another scenario where james potter had not said exactly what he felt like saying thank you very much after a while they carried on clearing up the mess while lily was kneeling there on the floor picking up parchment and being confused about how she was feeling somewhere on the same floor there was occurring a conversation in which her friends were voicing an equal confusion as to how the head girl was feeling you know i not sure i can take it anymore verity said conversationally as she stapled a copy of hogwarts hearsay to the wall with her wand i need to know what is going on in that girl head remus who was standing beside her holding a pile of their publication to be put up glanced at the way the parchment crinkled into the wall showing the unusual violence of the stapling charm tense much he asked i mean it just so weird verity continued in a voice that portrayed some sort of social disapproval why is he not dead yet more importantly why are they not sneaking off to the astronomy tower together yet lily knows james isnta prick anymore what more does she need i dontknow why the boy doesntget a move on sirius commented lazily from where he was leaning against the opposite wall finishing off a packet of liquorice wands no point in beating about the proverbial bush is there now as good a time as any to ask whether she ll go out with him she likes him doesntshe not really doing anything to help their endeavour he turned the packet inside out and started scooping up the fine sugar that dusted the inside of the foil a time honoured tradition amongst liquorice wand lovers this might sound a little strange to you padfoot remus said handing over another newsletter to be stapled but maybe prongs just doesntwant to push it you ll agree that this is probably the best their relationship has ever been right damn straight nodded sirius his tongue coated in orange sugar this castle is so empty without the sultry sound of lily cursing james within an inch of his life even the wildlife getting confused at the lack of noise and violence well then said remus maybe he thinks this is the best it going to get and doesntwant to cock it up ah the old share and scare problem sirius said pointing an orange finger upwards and raising his eyebrows in the motion of a scientist participating in a very important discussion share your love scare your love the timeless way of alienating close friend and casual acquaintance alike exactly that tosh verity said in a smaller voice staring straight at remus of course he wouldntalienate her what if she likes him too how is he to know that remus replied in a voice even more quiet and one had to wonder if the two of them were still talking on the subjects they had started off on behind them sirius stopped rustling his liquorice packet and glanced suspiciously from remus to verity bollocks to this verity said stuffing her wand into her back pocket i going to find her and winkle the truth out of her right now what but she with prongs sirius pointed out yes we agreed to get them on their own said remus but verity took off down the corridor jogging backwards to shout i ll tell her i need to go to the loo she called girls can never go to the loo on their own that true sirius told remus nodding as if from experience come on the sandy haired boy replied and they started after verity james was beginning to wonder if lily was ever going to speak to him again more importantly he was beginning to wonder if he would ever be able to speak to her again whenever he thought of something to say it started to seem so out of place in the situation neither of them had said anything in the past five minutes of picking up papers it was very odd he also wondered if lily would have really kissed him if their pile of parchment hadntdecided to pull a nose dive on them perhaps he should ask lilo came a voice from down the corridor the two heads turned around from the floor to see verity jogging down the corridor followed by sirius and remus grabbing the pile of papers she had made lily scrambled to her feet what going on she asked as her best friend neared have you finished remus hastily hid his copies of hogwarts hearsay behind his back er yes grinned verity i need the loo let go what asked lily as verity snaked her arm through hers and dragged her off but i was you were what lily glanced back at james but only for a moment nevermind she said i was going to say verity said you dontexpect me to go on my own do you lily gasped no of course not what kind of friend do you take me for i thought so their voices became fainter as they disappeared around the corner leaving the marauders standing amongst the remaining sheets of parchment of the floor why in the name of magic do girls always go to the loo together asked james running a hand over his head nobody knows but them prongs my ol mate sirius said and they re in no hurry to tell us added remus why sirius suddenly asked james what are you getting so narked about it for girls do it all the time were you busy by any chance what james asked incredulously he blew outwards through his top teeth and tipped his chin downwards pf no i was not busy what a notion you two are crackers i was with lilo for merlin sake his best friends glanced sideways at each other while james clutched a pile of papers to his chest uncomfortably then why are you going all twitchy asked remus yeah and why is your voice going a bit high and squeaky around the edges added sirius i am not declared james defiantly trying to make voice as low as possible and it is not what are you implying only that you and lily seem to be getting a lot friendlier lately remus said shrugging noncommittally yeah she stopped cursing you when you feel her up number one i have never felt lily up james said number two no words followed this introduction instead james blinked an awful lot and made various pouting movements with his mouth sirius sniggered and remus folded his arms smirking all right fine james said smiling as he unfolded his arms from around the newsletters and chucked them onto the floor in surrender the gig is up you ve rumbled me i think lily has changed her mind about how much of a twat i am hah didnti tell you remus exclaimed yeah all right you told me but i made it happen sirius argued no you didn t really said remus yes i did sirius insisted i flicked the magic switch in lilo head yeah with one question before which prongs has been having an entire attitude adjustment remus maintained james was beginning to look a bit put out er hello he said flatly waving a hand around between his best friends and here i was thinking this was supposed to be a joyous occasion sirius and remus had the decency to look slightly ashamed you re right we re terribly sorry remus said definitely added sirius in fact we re overjoyed continued remus nodding at sirius that right sirius nodded back then he turned grinning to james and cheered congratulations weh hey james folded his arms sniggering you two are stark raving did you know that he asked smiling as he started off towards the gryffindor common room yeah whatever mate sirius dismissed i still going to be your best man at the wedding what makes you think he ll pick you remus asked leaning forward round james to peer at sirius er more importantly what makes you think i even getting married james interrupted what do you mean of course you re getting married sirius said as if james were dense lily cottoned on to the fact that you re nicer than she thought just ask her out next chance you get and you ll be exchanging vows in no time you know sirius remus said as james simply gaped as best man you will have to write a speech sure i ll just get you to write it for me sirius shrugged hey whoa james exclaimed grasping each of his best friends by the backs of their collars and stopping them in the middle of the corridor before you start writing any manner of best man speeches you might want to know that my chances of getting lily to marry me are slimmer than the latest line of cleansweeps she and i are just friends and i have a feeling we re going to stay that way oh really drawled sirius well where is this feeling of yours then i ll beat its arse and make it see sense yes prongs you ve wanted to be with lily for so long remus agreed not to sound sickening but you two belong together james sighed but his eyebrows rose in an expression that suggested he agreed maybe he said diplomatically i just want to give it some space all right i dontwant to ruin it today probably been the best day of my life and i dontwant all lily smiles hugs and friendship to disappear just like that dontworry they won t remus insisted pushing james forward again towards the gryffindor tower do whatever you think is appropriate prongs just dontkeep us in suspense for too long eh yeah you dontwant moony to have to write a whole speech for nothing do you added sirius er verity lily said at some point during their stroll wasntthe turning towards the girls bathroom on the left we just passed oh lilo verity replied kindly we re not going to the girl bathroom we aren t asked lily beginning to worry slightly as an effect of the faintly crazed look on her best friend face and the unusually tight grip of her arm looped through lily elbow oh no verity said closing for a moment in reverence the girls bathroom is for small talk with people you see in there once or twice but dontparticularly like it is the place you go when you have a herbology exam that you haventrevised for or when you want tell someone that you re thinking of dumping your boyfriend for his best mate and want there to be absolutely no chance of him hearing it our little chat will be much more heavy duty we re going to the heads dorms and what would this little heavy duty chat be concerning asked lily fearing the worst what else verity replied with relish as they arrived in front of the twin cherry oak panelled doors but your love life wha lily said very articulately as verity said the password and pushed her inside what are you talking about ver you know as well as anyone despite skeeter continuous efforts to convey the contrary that my love life is about as interesting as watching a slug who watching professor binns who watching the grass on the quidditch pitch grow there nothing to tell that was worth dragging me all this way for oh come on lily verity said sit down and be reasonable as we both know i am your best friend and therefore i am entitled to know and remember every single small minute seemingly insignificant detail of your life and comment on whichever i deem worthy do you now certainly it goes along with my duty to stay up late with you on week nights eating ice cream straight out of the tub whilst reading magazines and my right to steal any item of clothing you possess from your wardrobe at any given time i see lily sat down on the sofa next to verity so darling best friend of mine which factor of my love life would you like to talk about the fact that i have not had a boyfriend in over six months or the fact that there have not been any offers from anyone to rectify the situation james asks you out verity said quite fairly he doesntcount he been doing it for close on three years even when i was going out with diggory lily quipped back besides i dontthink he ll be asking me out again any time soon somehow and verity tripped on something in her best friend tone how is your relationship with ol james these days she asked never one to beat about the bush why do people keep asking me that lily asked in a voice that was trying to avoid something because it looks interesting i expect verity said leaning towards lily and jutting her chin out in a rather intrusive manner they must have surely noticed how you and james seem to be getting along all the better these days specifically today lily said nothing she simply sat very still with her hands clasped between her knees and tried desperately to look as though she could not think what her best friend could possibly be talking about finally after a continuous staring at from verity lily cracked all right all right she yelled and her hands jumped from between her knees to grip the sofa cushions on either side of them haha verity cried triumphantly i knew it but nothing could stop lily from opening the flood doors on everything that had happened in the past twenty four hours so yesterday night in the hospital wing when sirius asked me what i hated about potter i really couldntthink of anything at all which was really odd and quite bizarre because you know potter has never really been my favourite person ever in the history of anything so sometime during the night when i had gotten over my shock and pulled myself together i asked myself what reason is there really to hate the boy so next morning potter wakes up and asks me what wrong because you know he does that really creepy thing where he knows exactly where i am and exactly how i feeling that sometimes scares the magic out of me and sometimes i am really quite thankful for yeah well he knew something was wrong and the thing was i just felt so guilty for having been so nasty to him for so long when he did nothing to deserve it i didntknow what to say to him and i tried to keep my mouth shut but it didntreally work like it not really working now anyway i had a bit of a breakdown right there in the hospital wing bed and the boy was just so nice to me although merlin knows why and now we re kind of friends well he says i was always his friend but we re kind of mutually friends the end lily said this all very fast and in a voice that jumped from pitch to pitch like a butterfly on a sugar high on a strong summer breeze it was like trying to condense hogwarts a history into three sentences there was just so much to say crickey said verity grinning like a cornish pixie in a glassware shop that was a saga and a half oh and nb added lily there also the small matter of us having almost kissed what twice i say again what once this morning in the hospital wing before you dropped the skeeter bombshell once this afternoon when we were putting up newsletters gosh you donthang around much do you verity said quite amazed you go from friends to potential snoggers in under ten minutes i thought james was first on your grand list of people whom you would rather kill than kiss lily sighed in a rather dreamy way and smiled leaning back on the sofa with a wave of her hand he used to be she said slowly but now i think he been quite removed from that list oh and is he on a new list then possibly lily said shyly in fact i think he may be first on the list of people i would rather kiss than kill really now exclaimed verity excitedly yes yes lily said waving her friend away and i shall say no more oh yes you sodding well shall dismissed verity this calls for pyjamas ice cream and magazines we may well be here all night a n so as you all know the previous chapter saw rita skeeter being publicly humiliated and we all had a good laugh at her fun times i hope you all have your invitations because i ve decided to move the skeeterbeater party to today welcome to koonelli and anne janet skeeterbeater party all right now imagine that all i giving you is rita skeeter there she is in the middle of nothing this is your chance to do anything you want to rita but please nothing too violent or dangerous bear in mind this fic is a t you can put rita anywhere you like within reason and can do just about anything to make her miserable the best entries will explain clearly how rita came to be in her awful situation not just plonk her in the middle of it with no explanation for example if you choose to put her in the middle of the sahara this is going to take a lot of explaining you may well also include other characters that you create who can be the medium of any curses that befall rita it would also be good if your entry is well written and entertaining if i laugh these are big points here are a few guidelines 1 try and stick to cannon for example i really doubt there are any fire extinguishers at hogwarts 2 no electrical appliances of any kind 3 no glass 4 please do not kill rita skeeter this is murder and i may have to call the police besides i might want to use her in another fic and i cantdo that if she dead now can i 5 you can even re write the broom closet scene in the previous chapter if you want you might not want to have her in a broom closet at all if you want to keep your review for this chapter and you entry separate you can email them to me at koonelli at gmail com the best ones will have a one shot dedicated to the author i know this is rather a crap prize but i dontknow what else i can put up for grabs

think it would bevery nice to be threatened with a spoon full of ice cream but then you d be surprised much like at the beginning of the fic things get thrown at lily there a bit of a party going down in the head dorms rock on lots of luff your on spring break author fifteen odds at the bookie after the hectic weekend of paparazzi war and revenge the head girl herself could be found lying on the sofa in the head common room in her pyjamas a blanket tangled around her legs and an empty tub of edmund and jonno cockroach cluster flavoured ice cream on the coffee table in font of her spoon sticking out it seemed she and her best friend had not been bothered enough to go back upstairs once they had polished off three tubs of ice cream and read out every single article in every magazine they possessed for the moment it had escaped lily notice that it was in fact a monday morning and that she was expected in a series of lessons very very soon at that moment she was in the hazy area between waking up and actually getting up a place where you are fully conscious but have not quite made the decision to open your eyes yet far from going down the route of opening her eyes lily was just considering the option of dipping back into sleep when she heard the sound of the doors opening and then voices one of a boy one of a girl so i ve been thinking sh lily still asleep lily heard the cushions of the other sofa shifting as someone sat down sorry i ve been thinking about what you said yesterday well i ve been more thinking about what you implied yesterday there was a moment of silence you re doing that thing where you begin to say something and dontfinish sorry about what you said yesterday i think you were completely right i think you are completely right and i think i like you ever more for it i know i like you even more for it you re doing that thing where you reiterate everything you say sorry it just i know i ve been rubbish when it comes to being your friend and i know i ve given so many excuses as to why nothing will ever go very far some excuses more genuine than others but i ve just been so afraid of hurting myself and anyone else especially you you re doing that thing where you tell me things i already know sorry i think i will just stop talking and kiss you lily smiled their soft murmuring in the background was gone and now she could go back to sleep everything was right in the world realisation broke so suddenly that there might have been a snapping sound in lily head her eyes flew open and there she saw verity and remus sitting on the other sofa sharing a kiss aha lily said sleepily perhaps it was just lily but remus and her best friend didntseem to be in any hurry to break apart it was a little reluctant if you asked her she didntthink they were striking the proper adequately apologetic tone either well at least they had the decency to stand up and look embarrassed verity coughed and rubbed the palms of her hands down the sides of her legs while remus tilted his head downwards and adjusted his school tie not liking the fact that she was sitting down while they were stood lily stumbled to her feet and snatched the spoon out of the empty ice cream tub pointing it at the two other gryffindors for good measure aha she repeated shaking the spoon which unfortunately flicked melted ice cream right onto remus and verity look lily remus began raising his hands in defence just put the spoon down there a good girl yeah lilo there really nothing to get so worked up about nothing to get so worked up about repeated lily incredulously nothing maybe apart from best friend she pointed the spoon at verity snogging other friend perhaps without ever a mention suggestion or apparent inclination to snog other friend maybe remus and verity glanced at each other actually i was surprised you hadnttwigged already verity murmured to her shoes we were being rather obvious added remus james and sirius guessed ages ago really lily asked in an inquiring voice and the spoon took on a less threatening position next to her shoulder gosh maybe they re both more perceptive then i thought speaking of perception lily was hit by a sudden wave of it by the way she said suddenly her eyes flicking down towards her friends attire why are you both in school uniform because it monday verity said nine forty five on the morning of remus added we have potions in fifteen minutes lily eyes widened and she looked around in horror needless to say in her pyjamas with her hair in disarray and her equipment for the day disorganised she was liable to get into a bit of a panic listening to the variation of curses that emerged from lily mouth verity was impressed i suppose we ll see you downstairs then remus shouted to the head girl over the sound of her racing to her door and slamming it behind her verity raised her eyebrows and smiled at remus while he glanced back uneasily well er he said quietly that went well verity grinned wider and raised a finger to scoop a fleck of ice cream off the boy nose and licked it cheekily could have been worse she said offhandedly setting off towards the door lily met her best friend and the marauders at the exit to the great hall having rushed about for the past ten minutes in a mad hurry to get ready lily had no time to sit down and have breakfast but she had made the informed decision that she had already forgiven verity for not telling her about her romantic interests she was further convinced this decision was the right one when her best friend handed her a warm danish pastry on her arrival not that the head girl was condoning blackmail in any way sorry verity said quietly as the two of them led the way to the dungeons for what smiled lily chomping on her pastry at some point on the group stroll james caught up with lily and verity morning he said cheerfully and once again lily felt some kind of hiccup in her chest that made her very air inside her lungs feel shy and made her want to smile verity did not help the situation any by sniggering at her expression she was just about to reply with a good morning when james tripped and almost went flying whoa lily yelled and grabbed his arm oi james exclaimed indignantly turning around to stare at someone behind him when lily turned to look she saw a group of slytherin fifth years they had only just passed many of them were sniggering at james and the one closest to the outside of the group a boy with thick eyebrows and a nose of a rather unfortunate size was staring straight back at james with a mockingly defiant expression what the boy spat smirking but james just shook his head with a vaguely disgusted expression and carried on walking in this action he amazed even himself two years ago and he would have hexed the slytherin into last week what in magic was that about lily asked him quietly once she had made sure that sirius was only intending to give a threatening glare to the group and jogged to catch up some twat stuck his foot out james told her lily tisked merlin how immature she said in a what is the world coming to tone i mean sticking your foot out who does that anymore no one sirius supplied that gag was outdated thirty seconds before the first person to think of it thought of it good of you to just ignore it though remus commented yeah nice one to disregard the louts added verity the question is lily said suddenly who in their right mind would trip you up later that day james understood what was going on other members of the gryffindor quidditch team had reported being tripped up kicked attacked hexed and or cursed during the course of the afternoon it starting already he thought and he was absolutely correct the pre inter house quidditch cup final hype was getting into full swing and the match was still over three weeks away soon james lily verity and sirius had to be careful whenever they ventured out of the heads dorms or the gryffindor tower innocent supporters were getting caught up in the excessive competitive spirit and tensions showed when various fist fights and minor duels began to break out in the corridors lily and james were only on their way to advanced defence when they witnessed a slytherin boy and gryffindor girl both in third year being dragged in the direction of the dungeons by filch he said gryffindor would only have a chance of winning if his team spontaneously keeled over and died on the field the girl was shouting furiously struggling against the grip the caretaker had on her collar she said magic willing they will the boy yelled back i dontcare who done it filch roared at them both tugging harder on their various articles of clothing in my book yer both guilty guilty for getting yer splat marks on the effin windows now shut yer oles despite the restrictions of school policy a widespread gambling venture had been set up by various individuals in the backbenches of classrooms odds were going around not only as to whom would win the match but how many players would be knocked out by injury how much time it would be before the first foul was awarded for quaffle pocking and if or when there would be any crowd streaking during the match even poor old remus had been offered a substantial amount of money plus a new broomstick on the condition that he do his best to say distracting things about his own house team during the match you know what you should have done sirius said to him when remus told them of his encounter with someone who obviously preferred to remain anonymous by the way he apparently was wearing a honeydukes pick n mix bag over his head taken the money and then slagged them off during the match that a fabulous idea padfoot remus said sarcastically then you can all come and see me in the emergency ward at st mungo when the slytherins assassinate me was only a suggestion notices went up all over the school reminding students that the school administration forbade both physical and magical violence in the strictest manner and consequences would be most serious for anyone who broke these rules it was clear how well these public announcements were working when madam pomfrey complained to the school administration that the incidents of broken noses she had to treat had gone up by three hundred per cent of course at the heart of all this tension were the gryffindor and slytherin teams themselves lily especially had come under intense fire since the slytherins had discovered that james had no reserve seeker there was also a theory going around that if lily werentplaying james concentration would go down the drain this theory was of course based on the well known fact that james fancied lily socks off suddenly lily found herself being pelted with all manner of odd projectiles including dungbombs ink bottles gobstones and once even an empty can of pumpkin fizz it was possibly the first time that lily was thankful for the reflexes she had built up against all the things james had thrown at her when they were eleven she and verity mostly shrugged it off verity commented that this sort of pre match violence happened all the time things only got really bad in the week leading up the match when lily was just shutting the door to the heads dorms one morning waiting for her outside in the corridor was james accompanied by two of the largest boys lily had ever seen she recalled them both being in seventh year and their ties told her they were in hufflepuff they werentquite as tall as james but they were twice as wide and had a way of standing that gave the impression most people would back against the wall to let them pass even in a four metre wide tunnel if it came down to a fight between the two of them lily wasntsure who would take whom ah there she is james grinned pushing himself upright off the wall with his foot lilo let me introduce you to gareth and trev hello lily said cautiously hitching the strap of her bag further up her shoulder hiya awrite er potter what are gareth and trev doing here shouldntthey be going to their lessons well lilo i very glad you asked that james said putting his hand on her back and guiding her towards charms gareth and trev followed you see gareth and trev have very kindly promised to take time out of their own schedules to make sure nothing happens to you at the hands of those dirty cheating slytherins isntthat right lads yes yes it is mr potter it is said the boy whom lily had gathered to be trev y see miss lily strictly speakin being hufflepuff we is s posed to be neutral you know gareth explained leaning over lily left side howeva continued trev we ve also bin somewhat appawled at de massiv amount of dirty dealin whot av bin goin on know whot i mean i see lily said as james nodded solemnly derfore said gareth we is just gonna be around tila match awrite only durin a day around school y know xept for da ladies room cos we aintallowed to go der y wonteven notice us promise ok lily said uneasily not quite clear on how she wouldntnotice two six foot four blokes following her around thank you i suppose no problem and so for the majority of the next week lily was never without gareth or trev who both turned out to be especially good at blocking curses and also quite good fun especially when verity and lily asked them who they would rather date out of all the member of the weird sisters and sparked off a debate that spanned two days the other good side of being flanked by two six foot four blokes was that people on the whole seemed to be less keen on throwing things and according to the bookies the odds of lily being out of the match were down by eighty seven per cent when lily wasntwith gareth or trev she was with james who towards friday seemed to be taking on their bodyguard duties as his own when he said to gareth and trev on the friday morn it alright lads i ll take it from here right you are mr potter good luck ina match miss lily oh inquired lily are gareth and trev out of a job now no i think they ve done a very good job of stopping you getting lynch mobbed james said look potter lily said as they arrived outside their transfiguration classroom it was a nice gesture really and gareth and trev are very funny and sweet but veri and i can look after ourselves watch yourself exclaimed james suddenly roping an arm around lily next moment lily found herself flat against the head boy chest as she heard something whistle past behind her on closer inspection this thing turned out to be some sort of long wooden dart that had impaled itself into the notice board next to lily hm arrows james commented gripping the red tipped dart and yanking it out of the cork board they ve never done that one before it fine lily said her voice shaky and disconnected i quite used to people trying to kill me by now she didnttell him but what she wasntused to was being so close to james at such short notice she knew she and james were supposed to be friends now but over the past month some of the things she had been feeling towards him definitely did not come under the category of feelings you would have towards a friend well james said loosening his arm around her shoulders so she could step back a little that good i suppose still tomorrow the match so this is their last chance to put us out of action i ve asked all the rest of the team to get straight back to the gryffindor tower after their last lesson asked or commanded lily asked amused all right commanded but politely james said trying not to smile i see anyway i think it would be good if you came back to the heads dorm after charms and stayed there for the evening just so the dirty cheating slytherins donthave any opportunity to corrupt you before tomorrow please is this your idea of commanding lily asked smirking as the line of students began to move into the classroom because honestly you re not very good at it no that the sort of thing i leave to the head girl reply james tilting his head down so he could peer at her funnily over his glasses all right potter your strength of persuasion has convinced me i shall retire early to the dorm in order to evade those dirty cheating slytherins you re an example to the team james told her putting a hand on her shoulder before going off to sit in his usual place next to sirius when lily had sat herself next to verity her best friend leaned over while professor mcgonagall was passing out stems of orchids and poked lily what this she whispered was that playful banter i heard you exchanging with james a few moments ago i would have never thought it oh stop being such a insufferable gossip lily told her but verity noticed she was smiling we were only agreeing that it would be sensible to retreat to the dorm after charms to avoid being mobbed verity made a soundless gasp a date she exclaimed gleefully watching lily eyes widen for the love of wands verity it is not a date lily that is complete bollocks you and james made a profound agreement to meet in a certain place at a certain time if that not a date then i ll say snape has washed his hair in the past week they had to stop talking then because mcgonagall had started giving them the evils i dontexpect you to do any work this weekend professor flitwick said kindly i am aware there a match on this got quite a rowdy cheer from the seventh years as everyone packed up their things and made their way to the door sirius was the first to turn the handle holy horklumps he exclaimed upon opening the door coming up behind him james reflected that he might have been critically mistaken when he assumed getting back to the heads dorm from the charms corridor was going to be a stroll in the park outside in the corridor was the largest amount of people james had ever seen crammed into a three by five metre space of corridor at a glance james summed up that about half of them were slytherins with intention of doing his teammates harm and the other half were either gryffindors hufflepuffs ravenclaws or staff with intention of stopping the previous intention on sight of james and lily it seemed all of them started shouting and sirius very sensibly james thought had to shut the door again with a slam merlin alive exclaimed verity what was that you said about not getting lynch mobbed lily asked james nervously come on lesson over someone shouted behind them yeah what the hold up remus turned round and gave the perpetrator his very worst look the hold up as you put it is that if any of us step outside this classroom into the rabble on the other side of that door someone going to get their nose broken verity smirked at the vaguely terrified look on the ravenclaw face well we re going to have to make a break for it some time or other james said reasonable listen we ll all make for the heads dorms that closer than the gryffindor tower isntit agreed nodded sirius right wands out as lily pulled out her ten and a quarter inch willow sirius put a hand on the door handle for the second time already more than a little nervous lily heart sparked when she felt james grasp her left hand the shouting started up again as soon the door was opened at the sight of lily verity and the marauders all with their wands out the mob seemed to draw back a little but before anyone knew what was happening curses had been fired into the air and chaos reigned lily and james busied themselves with bending right over and bowling through the crowd as fast as they could above all the incomprehensible noise james heard some of the things people were shouting avery i told you to stun them the first chance you got look that one there looks shifty enough get between him and the head girl mr potter would you care to comment on your team chances in tomorrow match miss evans what weaknesses would you say you still have after a year of playing that we i mean the slytherins could potentially exploit hey what happened where d they vanish off to slowly all of the gryffindors emerged on the other side of the crowd relatively unscathed standing up straight lily verity and the marauders glanced back at the mob just as someone at the back of the group turned round to spot them james tugged hard on lily hand and shouted run lily let out a small squeal and started laughing as they broke into a run oddly with james holding her hand nothing seemed quite as scary to her anymore it could even be said that that mad dash away from the crowd of people at the end of the corridor could have been one of the most fun moments of her life let face it when you were running for your life away from around five hundred people all in a bad state of crowd hysteria well she couldnthelp but see the funny side but only so long as james was holding her hand bloody hell cried sirius through a grin as their group rounded a corner and verity threw a quick glance behind herself the mob was falling back a little and it seemed as though many of them were beginning to decide that it wasntworth a high speed chase through the halls of hogwarts puffing and panting the gryffindors arrived at a stop in front of the double doors of the heads dorm in a very disorganised manner peter even fell over someone said the password and the lot of them collapsed through the doors on the somewhat giggly side my word that was fun sirius said to no one in particular never again replied remus but he was smiling aw sighed verity stretching her arms up and falling backwards onto the sofa oi are your hands glued together or something sirius asked james and lily craftily james looked down at the hand which was still clasped around lily s they both let go rather quickly and sirius grinned before turning to verity budge up you lump he said pushing at her legs so he could sit down merlin i could do with some food remarked peter seconded james said raising his hand and all the room occupants followed the trend james curfew was therefore suspended temporarily whilst lily and verity made a brief trip to the kitchens and the marauders made a brief trip to somewhere they wouldntsay where when lily and verity had staggered back up to the dorm with huge bags of food that the house elves had insisted on giving them they found the marauders sat downstairs around three or four large crates with butterbeer stamped on the side good grief lily exclaimed dropping her bags on the coffee table for peter to root through i ll say agreed verity were you thinking of having a party by any chance nothing wrong with a bit of light refreshment sirius said defensively before cracking the crates open with his wand much to lily surprise the evening went by faster than she thought it would she didnteven have to go upstairs to get a book or anything quickly discovering that the fours boys and one girl with her were hugely entertaining when gathered in one room along with food and butterbeer i dontknow what went wrong sirius was saying but when you transfigure a primrose into a parrot i sure they re not supposed to go that colour anyway being the well mannered gentleman that i am i offered to help the poor girl with her practical transfiguration homework and then one thing led to another and then oi have we run out of butterbeer there another crate somewhere lily said looking around by now their abode was rather a tip with food packaging everywhere bottles scattered about at the feet of sofas and on the coffee table cutlery strewn about the place and everyone stretch out leisurely on every sofa or armchair space that could be found do you reckon we should clear up asked peter no everyone shouted back i sorry but did you lot see rita skeeter just now in charms asked verity excitedly was that her with the scarf around her head james asked with a grin and the sunglasses yep verity said through her giggles i had to stuff my fist in my mouth when flitwick was taking the register and she had to gingerly put her hand up when he called her name obviously she wants to keep a bit of a low key these days brilliant remarked remus soon enough the excessive food and mildly alcoholic beverage took its toll on the gryffindors one by one they made themselves more comfortable on whatever sofa of armchair they were on as their eyelids submitted to gravity lily looked around sleepily to see sirius sprawled out sideways on the armchair head on one arm knees draped over the other peter was sitting on the same sofa as remus and verity clutching a cushion to his head verity had tipped over sideways to lean her head on remus lap and the boy had one hand on her shoulder and the other supporting his head lightweights james murmured from beside lily three bottles of butterbeer and five sandwiches each and they re gone pathetic lily agreed she pulled her feet up onto the coffee table next to james s being careful not to knock over any bottles having said that i might just drop off here and now james said in a low voice yeah merlin all those stairs to climb up lily sympathised then she leaned over onto james shoulder closing her eyes it really not worth it i had fun tonight said james after a while me too lily said half thoughtfully they re a rum lot your mates arentthey you re damn right they are they like you a lot you know do they sod knows why yeah you re right i joking joking lily put down the cushion she was about to hit him with and settled back down onto his shoulder no really they do like you possibly because you re one of the few girls in this school who hasntfallen for our charms and by charms i mean popularity fame money and general empty hype how sensible of me lily said a little nervously when she thought about how she may well have fallen for charms entirely different than those mentioned but i dontknow that the hype is as empty as you say you re not so bad yourself you know potter hm why thank you james replied putting a dramatic hand to his chest and yawning i think lily said i think ever since the beginning of this year every day i finding out more and more things i like about you i like how you donttake yourself seriously anymore i like how you have such a clear sense of what right and wrong i especially admire how after all those years of my constant abuse you still wanted to be my friend and you know mostly i really glad about this whole friends lark we ve got now i suppose the only thing that wrong with it is that now that we re friends you re not allowed to ask me out anymore i think if you did i d probably say yes you know i mean it sort of ironic the only time you re socially prevented from making a move on me is when i pretty sure i ve fallen in love with you it was a moment later when lily realised what she had just said oh merlin what had she done now what had her sleepy brain let her admit fraught with nauseous anxiety she waited for james to say something and waited and waited slowly turning her head to look at him she discovered that james head had flopped back onto the top of the sofa cushions his mouth agape as lily watched he made only the response of a light snore from the back of his nose lily sighed wryly typical she thought the first time she declares love for anybody and the object of her affection falls asleep during obviously this was not a good sign she shrugged closing her eyes and leaning back down on james shoulder oh well if at first you dontsucceed it was probably for the best anyway a n arggghhh tomorrow i go back to school and i still haventfinished the fic there is now less than a

broom luff your back to school tomorrow author 16 an o in charms on waking up and opening his eyes james blinked rapidly in the harsh sunlight that was filtering through the high window of the heads dorms lily he thought first looking down at the girl whose limbs were tangled up with several of his own saturday he thought second recalling that yesterday had been friday mess he thought third squinting at his surroundings in the early morning light his friends looked much the same as they had the night before except for sirius who had somehow ended up upside down with his feet draped over the back of the armchair and his head on the foot rest for the oddest reason james mind jumped back to the night before when he and lily had been the only ones left awake he had the sneakiest feeling that he might have fallen asleep while she had been talking which he cringed about nevermind it had afforded him a lovely dream in which he seemed to half remember lily telling him that she d fallen in love with him which had been a nice consolation for not hearing all that she had said last night obviously it was very nice sitting here with lily it was very nice being so close to her james reflected that their persons were as close as they could be without actually being the same person it was very nice when lily was being nice to him when she smiled at him and laughed at his jokes all in all if this was what being lily friend encompassed he reckoned her could just about hack it if only he could kiss her across the room verity woke up with a start blinking she reluctantly pushed herself off remus lap and sighed oh good grief she said in a low voice it today isntit what is james asked quietly then he took a sharp breath and swore under it verity gave him the most incredulous look in the history of incredulous looks you forgot she hissed at him half outraged half amused i didnt forget james argued i just didntremember you are the captain of gryffindor quidditch what else would you be thinking about on the morning of our last match against those dirty cheating slytherins the head girl shifted in james arms moving her head further across his chest slightly the edges of verity lips twitched nevermind forget i asked she said what time is it asked remus from beside her who had woken up as a result of the noise er ten o clock verity said glancing at her watch and looking at james worriedly what demanded the head boy oh sod it only an hour till the match get padfoot up would you we ve got to go soon while verity and remus took on the momentous task of waking up sirius james leaned forward and patted lily gently on the arm lilo lilo he called softly lily murmured something and shifted her arms to somewhere around his neck james grimly ignored the strengthening wish to forfeit the match and stay exactly where he was lilo wake up we need to be off to the pitch soon the redhead opened her eyes and then screwed them closed again in protest groaning in her sleepiness saturday already she complained on the other side of the room remus and verity had resorted to lifting the armchair between them and throwing a sound asleep sirius onto the carpet not only saturday but ten o clock james told lily we need to go very very soon lily sat up straight on the sofa and stretched her shoulders back what she did not want to think about at that moment was the fact that she had told james she loved him the night before but was that thought really so awful or was the thought that james had not heard her telling him that she loved him what her mind was avoiding a moment later lily decided the whole business was too much to think about five seconds after having woken up what she would prefer to think about she decided was how lovely it had been to sleep so close to james mind you that was dangerous water as well james had stood up and ambled over to where remus and verity were pondering the problem of sirius not waking up he was lying forwards on the floor with his cheek against the carpet his arms by his sides and his knees curled up under his chest padfoot james called nudging his friend with his foot come on time to get up nothing happened oi sirius yelled verity breakfast the boy on the floor shifted onto his side and murmured something that sounded something like yes coming francesca james and remus raised an eyebrow each when lily called from the sofa sirius quidditch like magic sirius turned onto his back with his eyes open blinking what he asked quickly right quidditch last match for the cup dirty cheating slytherins gimme a hand up will you ideally james would have liked his team to enter the great hall looking professional intimidating and meaning business it was regrettable then that he sirius lily and verity looked half asleep and rather slow verity hair was un brushed sirius still damp from the shower lily released three consecutive yawns and he imagined that he himself was not exactly putting forward an image of steely terror when his glasses were slightly askew and there were still flecks of toothpaste on his hands once they had sat down remus who was marginally more alert than the rest set about distributing food from various sources around them james looked the gryffindor table up and down and spotted the other members of his team who thankfully looked decent enough to play a game of quidditch getting back to more important matters he picked up a slice of toast and absentmindedly pushed a bowl of fruit salad towards lily i really nervous peter said through a mouthful of porridge nervous what have you got to be nervous about asked sirius i not awake enough to be nervous said verity pouring coffee into her goblet not really listening or paying attention james spooned some steaming scrambled eggs onto lily plate look at them sirius said disgruntled staring that the slytherin table i bet they ve come up with thousands of illegal schemes to wrong foot us oh stop being so bloody paranoid lily replied as james unconsciously put a muffin onto a plate and placed it next to her i sure mr richards will foul them or send them off or whatever you cantsend people off in quidditch verity corrected her crying shame i d say remus commented oi you said lily turning to james instead of drowning me in food can you eat some yourself please verity sniggered and muttered something that sounded like very fast metabolism james glanced at the many bowls and plates of breakfast that surrounded lily as though he was seeing them for the first time sorry he said in surprise force of habit lily let out a breath of laughter and offered him a muffin half and half asked james deal shouldntyou be going asked remus idly and after looking at his watch james jumped off his chair so quickly it seemed as though he had been trying to sit on a sea urchin ever resourceful the head boy stood on his chair and shouted down the gryffindor table quidditch team changing room now remember broomsticks and quidditch uniform no excuses matter of life and death once he had climbed down his friends were already getting up and sneakily trying to smuggle any breakfast that wouldntleak into their pockets good way to strike terror into those slytherins hearts prongs sirius remarked clapping his best friend on the back while she was changing the anxiousness that had been absent from breakfast was beginning to sneak up on lily bit by bit it made her feel like all the muscles in her body were thin and stretching and her stomach began to feel decidedly dodgy taking a deep breath and clasping her fingers together she thought that this was probably going to be the most important day in her life so far the onslaught from the slytherins before the match was going to be nothing compared to the wrath of gryffindors everywhere if she didntcatch the snitch more importantly what would james say if she didntcatch the snitch it wasntas if he had forced her to join the team he had asked plenty times but she had joined of her own accord it wasnteven as if she was doing him a sort of favour any more she liked flying she adored being on the team and james was trusting her to win them the game stupid bugger lining up just inside the entrance to the changing rooms was even worse each member of the team was wrapped up in their own last minute preparations keith was hurriedly clipping the twigs on the end of his broomstick sirius was busy tapping his beater bat thirty times on the outside of his legs a peculiar habit lily had never found out the reason for and ainsley was quietly promising anyone who d listen that if they won the match he d gladly shave off all his dreadlocks for sponsor money and give it all to charity behind the head girl verity lightly knocked the handle of her eagle against lily nimbus oi she said quietly as lily turned around give us a hug then lily pounced on her best friend and squeezed her round the neck for all she was worth ooh those slytherins are going to regret you ever joining the team verity said in lily ear yeah listen veri lily replied this moment would be perfect if your broomstick wasntdigging me in the back of the head verity hurriedly let go sorry she said panicked sorry oh merlin are you all right are you hurt if i ve done any damage james will bloody kill me it all right lily insisted i fine good it wouldntdo for us both to be out of action would it yeah right lily flapped at her dismissively james wouldntkill you you re probably right nodded verity casting a look back to where james was doing last minute spot checks on all his players as the best friend of his future wife i s pose he ll have keep a clean slate with me what demanded lily but james was already shouting for the team to get ready and line up verity only winked at her best friend and took her place next to simon lily rolled her eyes as james almost crashed into her in his hurry to get to the front muttering sunny light wind south easterly minimal cloud cover no mud he stopped quite abruptly and glanced down at his left hand lily had switched the hand that was holding her nimbus and taken hold of james s raising his eyes to look at her face james smiled as lily stared forwards defiantly as though there was nothing at all out of the ordinary with what she was doing although james knew that she knew it was the best thing she could have done at that moment james squeezed her hand tightly and lily looked at him for a moment tossing him a shy sort of half smile then the whole team jumped when remus voice sounded throughout the pitch students staff witch wizards etc today is saturday and welcome to today match james thought there might have been a few people of the outskirts of brazil that wouldnthave heard the tremendous roar of crowd appreciation released from the stands a notice for your own personal safety remus continued please keep all arms legs tails and other extremities inside the confines of the stands at all times no one wants a repeat of the hufflepuff vs ravenclaw bludger ahoy incident least of all mr filch who it says here had to clean the blood off the hufflepuff banners thank you there was a sound of flapping paper moving on please welcome to the pitch the gryffindors james led the way across the grass as the team names were read out playing today are the same people as always black hooch tall barker kipping evans and potter over half of this team will actually be leaving this year so let give them a fond farewell eh possibly because it was louder than usual for the first time lily fully heard the noise coming at the gryffindors from all sides perhaps she had been too nervous to listen in their matches against hufflepuff and ravenclaw but as remus fell quiet she really appreciated how many people were screaming as loud as they could to spur james and his team mates on crickey this meant an awful lot to a lot of people james nudged her in the side and grinned wave then he told her cheekily and lily pulled a nervous face as she raised a hand timidly if possible the noise in the pitch heightened whoever gets the captain job next year will be hard pressed to find talent that can follow this up that all i ll say remus told the crowd and now please welcome their opponents the slytherins cheering to rival that of before greeted the entrance of the team in green as the seven slytherin boys lined up across from the gryffindors lily watched her opponent darius zabini slytherin seeker and captain he stared back at her with a faintly amused expression that said all too clearly you you against me you ve got to be joking lily narrowed her eyes some of the nerves that had been growing inside her were cut back by her indignation like creepers being hacked off an old brick building playing today are mccarthy holloway snape moore aitkin cowell and zabini this match has been long awaited since its postponement last october remus informed the crowd now the slytherin team seem to be all fit an healthy so let get cracking mr richard prosthetic leg made hollow thumping noises on the dry ground as he limped down between the lines of players i watching you he warned glancing left and right at each of the team members i watching you like a doxy watches a juicy butterfly any funny business from any of you and there ll be trouble psh what he gonna do lily heard one slytherin beater mutter to his companion send us off this sent the both of them into a round of sniggering that lasted until mr richard turned around to face them lily weeds of anxiousness were sliced back a few more inches by the blade of her anger shake hands please the referee directed james and darius keeping eye contact james reached his hand forward but found nothing zabini stood there staring at him with that annoying smirk on his face that said this is all a huge waste of my valuable time james raised his eyebrows and turned his palm upwards shaking his head slightly this is ridiculous he thought laughs and jeers came from the slytherin end of the stands along with exclamations of indignation from almost everyone else oh bloody hell remus voice said just shake the man hand zabini then we could get down to some actual quidditch there was cough from behind him and remus turned around to glance at professor mcgonagall who had resolved to supervise the commentating as soon as she had caught wind of remus being offered money from one of the sides zabini emitted a light breath of laughter before grasping james hand and meeting the fiery gaze from the head boy hazel eyes mount your brooms lily looked up the thin wisps of cloud that flecked across the thin blue sky that was the whistle shouted remus and suddenly lily feet left the ground and flew all the way up to forty feet above the grass verity was busy making a swipe for the quaffle but it was snatched away by moore who had reached it first by at least a foot james quickly calculated that it wouldnthave been possible without moore leaving the ground before verity i e before the whistle hey the captain shouted and he and verity turned furiously towards the referee five seconds later however the whistle blew again because slytherin had scored and gained ten points what was that about shouted keith he had a false start didnthe nevermind james shouted back forcefully even if they cheat dontstop for anything unless the whistle goes just carry on all right we cantafford to loose any more points like that verity huffed up into her fringe but saluted none the less dashing off to catch the rebound quaffle from ainsley gryffindor in possession after a shaky start remus told the crowd it hooch gaining yards down the pitch pass to kipping now to potter james smiled as he caught the quaffle marvellous move that one with slytherin chasers coming at simon and james too far away to pass to verity had thrown the quaffle in just the right place for keith to smack with the palm of his hand in james direction the slytherin chasers tried to regroup as james sped away behind them towards the goal potter shoots goal the scores are even at ten all slytherin in possession james looked around and took half a second glance at lily and his smile widened into a grin she seemed to be doing very well indeed he thought back to what she had looked like in her very first match obviously terrified hovering above the game shivering with her legs curled up under her broomstick she had been reluctant to take her hand of the handle and made little jerky movements in various directions before deciding to fly and although james had been impressed because it was her first match it was nothing to how proud he was now lily had no trace of nerves about her whatsoever now and then she was hanging above the game scouring the pitch other times she was zipping in and out between players and balls always streamlined and alert if james hadntbeen throwing gobstoppers at her and hankering to get her to join the team that very same year he was sure he d think she d been on the team for at least three years there a pass to aitkin slytherin possession stretches down the pitch bludger approaches aitkin passes to mccarthy saved by tall who throws it back to kipping simon was making very good progress down the pitch very good progress indeed when one of the slytherin chasers who was relatively near him dodged a bludger the black ball went whizzing off behind moore straight into simon side there was a resounding ooouugh from the crowd as simon was knocked sideways thankfully he was only about twenty five feet off the ground any more than that and he wouldnthave been able to get up shakily after his fall time out called as madam pomfrey and a couple of volunteers make their way onto the pitch remus said will gryffindor be one player down cor blimey simon exclaimed as james landed near him those things hurt like the buggery are you all james began to say get out of the way the school nurse commanded pushing the head boy to the side and for such a young witch shoving a six foot six bloke three yards to the left was something very commendable crowding around to have a look verity put an arm around lily shoulders and lily bit her lip in a worried expression those things did look like they hurt like the buggery after a quick visual once over in which madam pomfrey lifted up simon shirt there were a few whistles from the crowd to show a large bruise she gave her diagnosis well apart from the bruise you ve got three broken ribs she told him if you go back on that pitch i ll take it that you re stark raving and have you committed to st mungo immediately there was a disappointed sigh from the gryffindor players james turned towards the commentator box and shook his head it one man down for gryffindor remus announced and the disappointment or triumph was evident through the crowd sorry mate sirius said to simon clapping him on the shoulder ouch ouch exclaimed simon watch that side sirius you moppet have a good one james said to his player as simon limped off with help from a couple of hufflepuffs who had come under madam pomfrey direction for the match he looked around and saw lily watching something following her gaze he spotted the slytherins having a fervent discussion in a huddle down their end of the pitch why do they keep glancing at us lily asked uneasily crossing her arms and hunching her shoulders because they re all about intimidation james said wankers keith added come on james said to lily and soon thirteen players and the ref were back in the air a funny thing happened to lily as soon as she was about thirty feet up and rising instead of feeling increasingly nervous about those looks the slytherins were giving her team she found that she just felt angry how dare they she thought how dare they try and intimidate us we are so much better than them any day of the week the quaffle is back in gryffindor possession and with only two chasers hooch and potter will have to work extra hard to come up to scratch hooch dodges a bludger thrown her way by holloway makes a pass intercepted by mccarthy who drops the quaffle at the threat of bludger from black sirius punched the air as james caught the quaffle and sped away with it he tossed it upwards to verity above him who curled it round snape in the goals twenty ten to the gryffindors announced remus as james and verity crossed flying paths and clapped one of their hands together in celebration possession taken by mccarthy fourth year on the team this week when this time four years ago he was upgraded from a reserve when old jake farnborough got suspended for putting zonko fizzing gas pellets in the school water system maybe it was just lily but she was sure that ever since simon had been carted off by the bandage brigade the slytherins were playing a much more aggressive game than before their beaters hit the bludgers with less aim and more power their chasers were resorting to anything to get a hold of the quaffle and more than once gryffindor found themselves not only dodging bludgers but slytherins apparently the musical theme from the last match had been carried on and adopted by those wearing green and silver in the crowd oh merlin james thought anything to distract the players sure enough the ditty that the slytherins came out with was both substandard and quite pointless oh you gryffindors you re rubbish you re crap we re gonna beat your arses straight off the map after that short musical interlude began remus but the gryffindors werentgoing to let that go without defending themselves we re just all that better why cantyou face the facts so stop your bloody cheating you stupid effin twats it happened before anyone knew what was happening keith was flying towards the nearest bludger trying to get there before cowell the slytherin beater victorious he cuffed the ball away from james towards aitkin but cowell wasntstopping in fact he zipped straight past keith and brought up his beater bat in a great swing missing the gryffindor head by inches there was a splintering sound in the pitch and a good six inches off the front of keith broomstick spun away across the stands where it was claimed by a gryffindor second year in the seventh row lily watched in horror as keith now had no control over his broomstick whatsoever the broomstick itself seemed panicked like a headless chicken and after a perilous moment or two of unsuccessfully trying to get to the ground keith was turned sideways and jerked off his cleansweep three knocking into the nearby slytherin goalpost and sliding down to the grass despite his attempts at escape keith was quickly taken under the care of madam pomfrey who pronounced his nose broken and his emotional welfare in shock on the pitch all hell was breaking loose cowell was retaining that he was only aiming for the bludger with his bat and that keith had just gotten in the way donteven try it james hollered furiously if he hadnthave gotten out of the way you would have killed him the captain had to be satisfied with a shot at the slytherin goals and the force with which james hurled the quaffle through the hoop actually made snape move out of the way of the shot after that the score is now thirty ten remus told the crowd but gryffindor is now two players short and if that doesntaffect their game i ll eat this microphone predictably remus did not have to eat his microphone because in the next ten minutes slytherin scored three times and gryffindor only once equalising the points at forty all james began to despair and lily searched all the harder for the snitch having a hard time beating alone sirius took it as a personal triumph when he intercepted a bludger that was heading for verity who was nearing the slytherin goals with the quaffle hooch shoots and finds a place for the quaffle in the middle hoop the gryffindor banners in the crowd waved enthusiastically but their owners cheers quickly turned to gasps as they watched what was happening to their chaser victorious verity had taken both hands off her broom while she flew back towards the centre of the pitch suddenly one of the opposing team chasers had made a grab for the tail of her broom and because verity had no hands on her own handle the broom stopped dead sadly the same could not be said for verity she continued to move at fifty miles an hour straight off the end of her broom and tumbling head first into the stands there then came a stream of uncharacteristic swearing from the commentator box along with the furious sound of professor mcgonagall voice in the background mr lupin such language will not be tolerated at public school matches watch your mouth or you ll find yourself in detention for a week sorry professor came a mutter from the background then remus turned back to the microphone move out of the way there let those people through lily watched anxiously as madam pomfrey and her volunteers fought their way through the crowd to where a ravenclaw fifth year was helping verity to stand up it quickly became apparent that the chaser was not about to be let back on the field by the way she limped on her left knee that was bent at a rather peculiar angle once she had gotten down from the stands she had a brief argument with the school nurse i expressly forbid it we need to get that knee looked at it quidditch played on broomsticks what do i need my leg for it was a refusal from james to let her back onto his team that finally got her taken off the hospital wing though and lily anger soared as she turned away and resumed her search she now saw what they were trying to do they were trying to pick the gryffindors off one by one before she caught the snitch or gryffindor could get ahead by one hundred and fifty points it an hour into the game and already gryffindor are two chasers and one beater down trailing behind in the score with sixty points to slytherin one hundred and fifty who would have thought their luck would turn so ugly after two spectacular wins earlier this year at around this time james had started wishing for anyone anything to save the match or alternatively the lives of his remaining players the slytherins were playing such an aggressive game that he was beginning to think he ainsley sirius and lily were playing to stay alive not just to win the game he was only thankful that lily had managed to avoid being fouled if his team lost their seeker if he lost lily next to go was ainsley sirius suddenly realised that he couldntsee any bludgers lily spotted them bizarrely being restrained in the arms of both the slytherin beaters who were struggling to keep a hold of them watch out ainsley lily screamed but ainsley only turned around to see the beaters letting go of the bludgers and batting them hard towards him he had to be commended really james thought he did manage to dodge the first bludger very skilfully unfortunately the second one snapped his broomstick in half and sent him straight down onto the grass below by now james was beginning to think that he must have done something terrible in his past life like cheated thousands of witches and wizards out of their savings as chief executive of gringotts or dumped thousands of tonnes of sewage into mermish waters this was the only explanation for why all the players on his team were being violently thrown out of action and gryffindor was down by one hundred and thirty points perhaps he had died as grindlewald and come back as james potter now as well as having to do the jobs of three chasers he had to stretch himself to do that of the keeper as well he rushed to save the quaffle from going through the gryffindor goals and surveyed the pitch three chasers and the keeper against him advancing aggressively looking as if they would gladly have gryffindor with no chasers at all resorting to unorthodox methods james tossed the quaffle lightly into the air and swung the handle of his hurricane 5 up to met it cupping his hand above his eyes james squinted at the arc that the quaffle made as it sailed over all the slytherin chasers to the other end of the pitch snape only noticed the quaffle whizzing towards him half a second before it fell through the middle hoop james hoped there was nothing in the rules that said he couldntdo that after a quick flick through the five ten inch thick volumes of the rules of quidditch remus told the crowd professor mcgonagall has decided that the tactic you just witnessed has never been attempted and consequently there is no rule preventing it score stands at eighty points to one hundred and fifty sirius was laughing his head off i bet you never saw that one coming did you snivellus he hollered spinning his beater bat between his fingers he turned away and prepared to shoot off in pursuit of a bludger but snape had drifted up behind him raising the quaffle above his head the slytherin brought it down onto the tail of sirius broomstick with such furious force that the broomstick tipped backwards and catapulted its owner clean off now not only was the commentator swearing but his supervisor was right there with him snatching the pointed hat off her tight bun and flinging it down onto the floor in fury as mr richards awarded james five more fouls the captain took deep breath after deep breath in a bid to stop himself maiming snape to distract himself from actions decent wizards would never approve of he called a time out as he and lily landed on the grass and ran towards each other he could sense the slytherins down the other end of the pitch laughing at him lily felt her heartstrings stretch painfully at the sight of the head boy he was pale as new parchment and shaking slightly after shifting from foot to foot wondering what to do lily arms darted round james shoulders and she squeezed him for a moment james squeezed her back you all right lily asked quietly pulling back and swapping her broomstick from one hand to the other nervously james glanced to the side and took a deep breath look lilo he said honestly i think we re pretty buggered right now i think we should just give it to them and hope for a rematch what asked lily taking a small step forward but but this is our last game we ve been practicing for this all year we cantgive up now we can still win it seriously lily as a captain who been playing for the best part of six years i telling you the truth our chances are a million to one james told her sincerely shrugging in a hopeless way you know normally i d be playing till we get beaten fair and square but frankly this game is as fair as a pixie against a troll and about as square as this quaffle maybe i d be able to put up with it if we didnthave five players in the hospital wing but if kicking off again means you getting hurt then really i d rather forfeit lilo but lily was not looking at him her face was turned towards him but she was watching something very carefully out of the corner of her eye opening her mouth slightly she reached forward and clasped james arm dontlook now she said in a low voice but i see the snitch what asked james you re kidding are you sure more positive than an o in charms lily replied for the slimmest moment her emerald eyes flicked to his face look you said that you put me on the team because you believed i could do it well right now i believe i can do it trust me call a time in and you and i will show those slytherins that even with two players against seven cheating ones we can boot their arses from here to there james hesitated he looked at the amount of suppressed excitement on lily face saw her little finger twitching around the body of her nimbus the way she was holding his arm told him that he and she were in it together he had the feeling that it was they against everyone else he was amazed how much that feeling meant to him he closed his eyes and released a breath all right i hereby certify myself officially insane and call a time in yes lily hissed then she jumped up and pecked him on the cheek james blinked hey lily shouted to mr richards time in the ref reflected for a moment that it was only the captain who could call a time in but dismissed this regulation since everyone who wasnt captain currently made up fifty per cent of the gryffindor team ready to resume play he called raising the whistle to his lips everyone remounted their broomsticks lily tried to watch the snitch without looking directly at it and the whistle signals play to continue announced remus gryffindor in possession potter to take five more fouls there evans with a quick start off the field good merlin she really going for it wow look at her go zabini tailing her and my word was that the snitch lily could feel the air current behind her as she cut through the sky flying faster than she d ever flown before the little golden ball was humming high in the air near the ravenclaw part of the stands upon her advance lily could have sworn she heard it emit a tiny squeal of terror before it darted off in the opposite direction to her there was a whoosh behind her and she knew zabini was close trying to overtake her she wasntworried though she was getting closer and closer and however much the tiny snitch jerked this way and that in front of her she was sure she was going to catch it it seemed close enough to touch every drop of adrenaline inside her spirit forced its way up her arm as she stretched out her fingers lily felt herself jerk as her broomstick slowed down abruptly the snitch spun far out of reach as lily spine lashed forwards as if she was on the knight bus and it had braked in a split second to let a hedgehog cross the road hey she screamed twisting around to see none other than darius zabini holding onto the tail of her broomstick for dear life without a quick flick through the five ten inch thick volumes of the rules of quidditch i can tell you all now that is against the rules remus ranted heatedly lily paid no attention she paid no attention to the way thousands in the crowd were standing up in protest she paid no attention to mr richards blowing his whistle like a steam engine going full throttle she paid no attention to the slytherin seeker doing his best to stop her winning this watch no one was going to stop her catching the snitch no one was going to stop winning the match and above all else no one was going to stop her winning this match for james the only thing she noticed was that the snitch was less than a metre away with all the rushing in her head there was absolutely no room at all for fear she only slammed her palms down on the handle hoisted her feet up onto the broom stood up on her nimbus one thousand and leapt clean off into thin air as she curled both hands round for the snitch a n ouch so yes in honour of this momentous cliffie i have composed a short poem here it is i am

last chapter so of course i canttell you anthing about what happens especially after such an ending to this one winks 17 the life and magic obviously when lily had jumped off her broomstick her primary objective had been to catch the snitch however her thought processes had sort of stopped there what she would do once she had caught the snitch was something she had not really though about in so much detail it was a dilemma that hit her while the fingers of her right hand were tightening round the small golden ball but her brain did not even get very much further than that it was as if all rational thought had taken one look at the situation and said now you ve done it i tried to warn you but would you listen no o o that it now you re on your own on the bright side a pleasant humming had taken the place of the mortal terror that you would have thought anyone would be feeling in her particular situation as the constant of gravity roped its arms around her and pulled her towards the ground being no stranger to life or death situations for examples see recent inter house guerrilla warfare and potential lynch mobbing lily reflected idly that she probably wouldntdie you know all things considered how she had come to this conclusion is questionable but she thought she probably would end up in the hospital wing for a few weeks and she wondered whether it would be enough to make her miss her newts although the ground was coming towards her at an alarmingly fast speed funny that and the faster the ground came towards her the more time lily predicted she would be confined to a bed with white sheets it was beginning to get quite scary in that respect now that she d had time to think about it while the air rushed past her making the folds of her scarlet quidditch uniform shake to and fro she began to panic whether she died or not falling from this sort of height was bound to be quite painful whichever way you looked at it just when lily was starting to fear she was going to be spending her whole life in the hospital wing her course of movement changed rather drastically it was a bit of a shock when something collided quite forcefully with something that was not the ground this thing in fact came at her from a ninety degree angle at fifty miles an hour so you could see why this change was unexpected the circumstances themselves were also a bit of a major change for instead of tumbling freely nothing holding her back out on her own a toy to gravity now she found herself in the rather confined space of someone arms this someone was quickly identified as james potter now there were things all around her in front of her was james chest around her were his arms underneath her were his knees and the handle of his hurricane 5 all in all she had to say that her current situation was far better than the one she had been in three seconds ago although she was afraid that her rib cage would soon collapse in on itself if james did not loosen the grip he had around her a little because the head boy arms were otherwise engaged his broomstick slowed down and gradually drifted towards the ground so that he and lily sort of tumbled off it onto the grass in one big bundle of limbs quidditch uniforms and shin pads they ended up kneeling on the ground with james still retaining his death grip on as much of lily as he could get into his arms both of them were breathing as if oxygen was a limited edition chocolate from honeydukes in long deep breaths that each of them could feel through the other chest lily heard james muttering something and she soon realised that it was the single word almost almost almost being whispered over and over again james thought that at that moment holding lily as close to him as possible must have been the only thing that was keeping him from going mad it was hard to believe that he had caught her and that she was not being led off the pitch on a stretcher for a moment there he had thought it had all gone wrong he had thought it was all over he had been shot in the heart with the sharpest splinter of terror that he had felt in his life he had thought lily was going to die thoughts like this are often some of the hardest to wipe from one mind even as james had felt the impact of his colliding with lily and scooping her out of her dive he found it hard to think of anything else apart from the fact that she had only been about six metres from the ground it was getting better though now he could feel himself clinging her he could begin to believe it every breath that she pushed out against him was further proof that she was alive every slight shift of her arms around his neck banished the worst from his mind a little more there was a roaring sound in lily ears and it took a moment to realise that it was the sound of two thousand people standing up and cheering it took another moment to realise why it was that there were two thousand people stood up and cheering she pulled away slightly and in the four or so inches between them she opened her hand to show him the snitch which was flapping its small battered wings in a half hearted sort of way james gave it a sort of dismissive look that said that nice before pouncing on lily once more the head girl rolled her eyes and smiled never one to complain about being hugged by someone she quite fancied i hope none of you closed your eyes for a second there remus said sounding quite exhausted i hope none of you turned away or looked somewhere else or sneezed or anything if you did i ll tell you that you just missed the most amazing stunt in the history of hogwarts quidditch and you ought to be bloody kicking yourselves right now james began to contemplate the fact that he may well have to start thinking about considering entertaining the notion of letting go of lily at some point when wave after wave of scarlet clad fans started a full scale invasion of the field he and lily scrambled to their feet and lily held up the snitch and laughed as there was a new wave of cheering she turned to james and grinned wave then she said cheekily and james raised a hand blowing out a sigh in a kind of awe that made lily laugh harder soon enough they were swamped by the crowd and the sheer current of maniacal fans carried them off oh we re going this way are we james said conversationally to no one in particular fair enough lily added between the ecstatic exclamations of various red clad people who were shaking their banner in triumph as for the quidditch cup james did not particularly care for standing up on the podium and holding up the cup true he had been looking forward to doing it for six years ever since he had started playing but it wasntthe same with only himself and lily sirius verity ainsley simon and keith had all helped them to win the cup and he felt that they should have been up there too standing in line receiving the cup that professor dumbledore passed to them everyone cheered when he and lily were presented with it nonetheless especially professor mcgonagall amusingly but as james lowered his arm again he had a fabulous idea he waved for quiet as lily watched and began speaking so er he said casually when the crowd had quietened down a bit thanks very much cheers and er everyone party heads dorms follow us see you there this was predictably followed by another round of cheering james jumped off the podium and held up a hand to lily who leaned on it to hop down without any kind of explanation he tugged her after him by the hand and they began a brisk walk across the grounds followed incidentally by around three hundred fans and remus who had abandoned his post behind the microphone and joined them at the front of the crowd just as ecstatic as the rest of them lily was grinning all the way she could honestly not remember being this happy at any point in her life before she hadnteven thought it was possible to be this happy but apparently it was and she was sorry that more people couldntfeel the way she did she thought it must have been the way james kept glancing at her as they walked as if he couldntquite believe they had won and needed to refresh his memory every five seconds there was a bit of a scramble to get through the doors to the entrance hall but they managed it the portraits of hogwarts must have gotten the shock of their iconic lives at the sound of so many rowdy students sweeping through the castle another round of gryffindor singing had started up somewhere in the back and it wasntlong before the group had travelled through the corridors of hogwarts james severely pitied anyone who had intended to travel in the opposite direction of their little excursion group and arrived at one of the turnings that lead to the head dorms suddenly james turned around hold on a sec he said to lily and twisted them both round oi you lot he hollered over the crowd of gryffindors we re just gonna take a small detour wontbe a minute a couple of people looked at each other and shrugged cheerfully and lily was beginning to suspect that even if james had said something like you re all hideously ugly buggers and thick to boot her housemates still would have cheered uproariously potter she yelled over the noise where are we off to ah you ll see james shouted back and led them all the way to a stop outside the hospital wing up until then all the gryffindor players had been confined to the wing on madam pomfrey orders according to her it was the best thing for repaired bones and healed cuts to be allowed to settle she didntadd that she thought quidditch was the bane of her existence and a sure shot at killing yourself but the gryffindors surmised this well enough from her tone those that werentconfined to white sheeted mattresses had crowded round the windows trying to scrape together a view of the quidditch pitch but their side of the castle was at the most annoying angle of looking out onto only a measly corner of the stands only about one in every ten words of remus commentary was loud enough to be picked out so all the way through the remainder of the match sirius verity simon ainsley and keith had been trying to work out which side was winning by listening to the cheers of the crowd it was like trying to paint a scene of the sixteenth century troll wars with only a twig and some brown paint this was particularly exasperating when at one point it looked like everyone in that little corner of the stands was standing up and a unanimous gasp rose from the crowd like steam from a coffee maker what just happened demanded verity a little hysterically from her bed who knows search me no clue sirius ainsley and keith said in turn when ainsley spotted all the ravenclaws climbing down from their end of the stands he gathered that the match must be over i canttake it verity announced give you knee time to fuse she said imitating the nurse what a load of rubbish i off to find someone who can tell me what going on the chaser had only just started to put weight gingerly on her knee when she got distracted the roar of the crowd was getting louder and louder by the second merlin alive remarked sirius d you hear that yeah nodded simon whose midriff was in a cast to allow his newly repaired ribs to settle sounds like a herd of stampeding hippogriffs that can sing quidditch songs i ve seen it before you know keith told him we must have won verity said slowly it only explanation we won as if to prove her point the doors flew open and the mob spilled through into the room their clamour filling the space like the smell of dungbombs fills the corridor on the last day of term the white walls clashing impressively with their brightly coloured banners and painted faces verity screamed with glee and sirius burst out laughing you did it shrieked verity as lily fought her way over to the bed her friend was perched on i dont believe it you did it yeah lily shouted back we did it gryffindor won not caring at all about her supposedly bad knee verity jumped up and seized lily by the hands dancing around and screaming like mad it was probably lucky that remus had fought his way over because this gave verity someone to kiss squarely on the lips in happiness but never mind about that lily shouted to her party come on aw this was almost worth getting temporarily crippled for declared verity fan sodding tastic once the remaining gryffindor players had been rounded up some of them had required active transportation due to the nature of their injuries james had stood on one of the beds and shouted right o to the heads dorms everyone i say came a screech from the doorway those nearest to the noise turned around with minimum interest to see madam pomfrey who had rushed out of her office looking livid what is this this invasion what are all doing in my wing haventyou noticed there are injured patients in the vicinity get out get out you re all terribly unsanitary s all right james called waving a hand to the nurse over the crowd we were just leaving thank you it was only once the lot of them had cleared out of her dominion that madam pomfrey realised she had been robbed of all her patients so the excursion continued back to the heads dorms someone said the password and this further suggested that by now everyone in the school must have known it they really must change it soon lily thought as soon as the first gryffindors flooded into the room preparations began to get underway people were dispatched to the kitchens to fetch food and drink someone had made the crucial decision to set up the magical gramophone in the corner and all the banners that had been waved at the match were hung up around the room aw brilliant grinned sirius strolling into the room and clapping his hands together i not sure what better verity said conversationally as she skipped into the room remus behind her the match or the post match party can someone put a decent record on shouted james making to pull lily through the door behind him as the music started up and people gave their official cheer of approval but lily suddenly stopped and tugged him back letting a group of rather lairy third years past them as they both stumbled off to the side no one took much notice of them and james said cheerfully lilo what up then cheekily there a party just in the next room if you hadntnoticed lily was looking down towards where both her hands were holding his james hoped this didnthave anything to do with the jump as it was now known as in his brain he hoped that she didntthink she had to apologise or explain herself or anything let face it anything she did he d probably done worse he found he didntneed to hear it anyway i had noticed she said slowly but i wanted to you know say thanks for ensuring i wasntgoing to spend the rest of my life in st mungo s james squeezed her hand it was nothing he said donteven worry about it anyone would have done the same just try to resist any urges you get to leap off airborne broomsticks in the future all right lily only seemed to become more flustered yes but still it was rather nice of you she said her voice speeding up well i could hardly let anything happen to the head girl could i james asked teasing then i might actually have to do some work around here lily laughed briefly but she didntseem to have said everything she had queued up in her head anyway she continued it wonthappen again i promise that the end of my short lived career in broom diving no more stick leaping ever i glad to hear it james said patiently wondering whether there was in fact any point to this conversation when he had a mind to ask lily to dance when they joined the party because you know when you gave me that seeker place you were trusting me to catch the snitch werentyou i was not that i cared any at that point because you know i didntmuch like you and i was only doing it to get back at that cow skeeter but i suppose gradually i really started to care about it because partly i really got swept up in the whole quidditch mentality and also partly because well i liked you and i didntwant to let you down because you really believed i could do it and i see now that that why you gave me the position and lily was abruptly cut off at this point because james had suddenly taken it upon himself to put his free hand just below lily ear and bend down to kiss her of course lily had already known that it was quite nice to kiss james potter when his lips were blue with cold and he was half conscious now however james didntquite know what he was doing at first when lily made a slight noise of surprise but then she made another noise one that sounded a bit like the one you would make when taking a first bite of a very good strawberry cheesecake so he supposed that he must have at least been doing something right it then came to his attention that what he was doing might be in fact very wrong panicking slightly he pulled back keeping his hand on her face i sorry he said lily only blinked as she opened her eyes what for she asked truthfully thinking that if it were not for both of her hands holding onto james s she quite possibly would have fallen over by now we re friends james said surely as if it were the only thing he could be completely sure of at that moment we are lily agreed that not going to change is it no james said quickly no in no way is that ever going to change that the last thing i would ever want i mean i dontknow what i doing that why i told myself i wasnt allowed to kiss you lily smiled a bit he still wanted to kiss her did he well i dontknow she said raising her eyebrows i not so sure i would mind james looked as though his whole world had just rotated through one hundred and eighty degrees he didntso much as move for a long time and it seemed as though he had lost all use of the muscles in his jaw you what now he asked in a low quick voice i not sure i would mind at all actually lily continued looking shyly down at her shoes i mean of course we could still be friends would it really make all that much of a difference james blinked several times this could have denoted that he was rapidly loosing control of that little but very important sector of the brain that makes sure you dontsay anything fantastically stupid i in love with you he said i think you must know that but in case you thought otherwise i telling you now does that make a difference lily eyes flicked back up and their stares clicked into place i think it makes all the difference trying to match the sincerity of her words to the sincerity of her eyes because actually i quite sure i in love with you too james breathed out the breath he had been holding very very slowly a smile was growing on his face but he frowned a little as if he wasntquite ready to believe it just yet joking he said quietly you re joking arentyou lily tilted her head to the left a bit and narrowed an eye at him then she decided to toss both her arms around his neck stand on her tip toes and kiss the life and magic out of him and james thought that if his arms hadntgone around lily waist he quite possibly would have fallen over does it feel like i joking the head girl asked him pointedly n not really no james replied a flush blossoming under his eyes as he pushed his glasses back up his nose and just for that he wanted to kiss her again back inside the heads dorms the party only got better and better the sofas armchairs and other furniture got shoved to the edges of the room so that girls could drag boys by the hand into the middle to dance with them bottles cans and cups were emptied food disappeared from plates and the amount of time that passed from the point when the first students invaded the dorm was directly proportional to the noise level in the room when lily and james ventured back into their habitat they found that the party had progressed a fair amount remus and verity were sat on one of the sofas under the balcony windows shoulder to shoulder talking just under the music their hands secretly clasped between them sirius was sprawled out on an armchair on the opposite side of the room with a sincere expression arranged on his face well i must admit he was saying to one harriet wicket as she draped herself over the arm of the chair paying the polar opposite attention of what she usually did in history of magic when i first hit the ground the pain in this arm was the worst i ve felt in my life but you know now with you here it seems to be disappearing fast did you know there room for two in these things remember this day forever someone shouted as they strode past in front of the head boy and girl it was anita skeeter complete with camera waving a bundle of photographs around in the air i ve captured everything goals dives blood and broken bones single copies ten knuts three for a sickle full set for just one galleon over by the fireplace a first year girl was standing on the coffee table giving simon ainsley and keith an animated account of everything that had happened after they had been cruelly torn from the action so she flying and flying and she going to catch it right but then that other seeker bloke from slytherin grabs a hold of her broomstick tail so she gets up like this right and then she takes this great flying leap right james turned to lily and grinned looks you re going to go down in hogwarts history as that girl who jumped off her broomstick he told her well lily smiled sceptically only until the next person does it and that ll probably be all too soon then i ll just be known as that girl who started this bizarre movement of jumping off broomsticks oh i dunno shrugged james he curled an arm around her waist and pulled her down onto a sofa with him i could live with that besides i think it far more likely that you ll go down in history as that head girl who did what everyone else wished they could and shoved rita skeeter off her high hippogriff urg lily pulled a face fitting her hands in the head boy s i not sure i want to be associated with her yeah you re right lily surveyed the scene in front of them for a moment she decided that it was definitely a good place to be she thought that the number of smiles and sounds of laughter might have been the most she d ever come across in one place before considering all the post match parties she d ever attended she d noticed that the amount of carnage left after the event matched up pretty closely with how good the party had been with this fact in mind she was somewhat proud to see that the dorm was now an absolute tip strewn with bottles packets banners streamers and various pieces of quidditch uniforms she pitied the poor sod who would have to clear up after them but for the moment it looked like a lot of fun for everybody what about she then said to james that girl who realised far too late that james potter had changed and had become particularly fond of him by the end of the year hah james said in a long thoughtful syllable i do believe i like it good it not as good as mine though what well think about it james said fairly i get to be that bloke who fell in love with that girl who realised far too late that he had changed and had become particularly fond of him by the end of the year and ended up receiving the best kisses of his life it took lily a moment to work it all out during which a handful of balloons appeared in the room and started to float around above the students magically spreading streams of scarlet and gold bubbles in their wake it not very catchy is it she asked reasonably no it not very agreed james all right we ll shorten it i shall just be that bloke who loved lily evans lily turned to look at him as a streamer flew overhead landing on the top of james glasses in a length of red ribbon she picked it off his nose and smiled i could live with that she said looping the ribbon around his head to bring their lips together at some point around two in the morning there came a loud banging from the front doors of the dorm and the gryffindors thinking nothing could possibly spoil their fun threw them open in welcome only to find a foul spirited filch accompanied as ever by his scraggy pet mrs norris the long and short of it was that they all got thrown out and lost themselves fifty points for being out after hours the longer and shorter of it was that the gryffindors hardly cared it had been worth it and besides fifty points was nothing to what had been won in the match so it was that lily and james had to stand by the doors to see that all the students left so that everyone who belonged to their respective houses could be frogmarched back to them by either filch or mrs norris this took rather a long time after a lot of protest from those who didntwant the party to end there seemed to be a lot of people who wanted to congratulate the heads on a snitch well caught or a party well thrown night all sirius called reaching up to give james a knee buckling clap on the shoulder obviously slightly tipsy first rate shindig nicely done best yet i d say yes well done glad you survived the year of quidditch lily remus said to her winking and making the head girl laugh only just she replied and gave him a brief hug before the school caretaker herded him out the door quite forcefully see you tomorrow captain verity said saluting to james though not as smartly as usual probably due to the butterbeer then the chaser pounced on lily i assume you had a good time tonight she hissed rather loudly in lily ear and dontthink i didntsee that business with the ribbon oh lily said through a sly grin well i think we should schedule tomorrow night as an ice cream in pyjamas night so i can tell you all about it too right we are verity replied as she pulled back and joined remus outside slinging an arm about his shoulder and following the crowd back to the gryffindor tower after filch had threatened them with bodily harm if the dorm was not spotlessly clean by monday and slammed the doors behind the last few stragglers james sighed contentedly and checked his watch quarter past three lily picked her way through the debris and started absent mindedly gathering up bottles humming the last song that had been playing before their humble little get together had been gate crashed salright james said ambling over to her and giving her half a hug while his other hand took the bottles gently from her clutches and put them back on the mantelpiece we ll do it tomorrow when we can blackmail any passers by to help us mm lily agreed nodding sleepily good idea she collapsed back into the nearest armchair and laid her head on james lap when he had perched himself on the arm you off to bed soon he asked in a tone that told her the answer had better be yes lily made a noncommittal noise dontmake me resort to carrying you again lilo james warned i will do it you know i bet you couldntmanage all those stairs lily cajoled him all right here we go then james said cheerfully and soon enough lily was leaning her forehead against james neck as he removed her from the armchair and actively transported her up her stairs it was a good deal easier he thought when she wasntsulking about it as they reached lily room the redhead released an almighty yawn that looked as though it had taken more effort than that which james had used to carry her up the stairs your room madam james said politely depositing lily onto the purple carpet thank you kindly she replied rubbing her eyes james ran a finger along those bits of hair that brushed across her eyes not really doing anything of practicality that was something of a party wasntit he said yeah lily agreed the mess downstairs is a tribute to that night night then james said see you in the morning lily said stretching up to kiss him just as james had reached the door thinking longingly of his own purple duvet on his four poster lily turned to look at him from her place sitting on the bed potter she said and james stopped turning with his hand on the door handle we did alright today didntwe lily said slowly won a quidditch match rescued our team mates from madam pomfrey threw a bit of party we re a fantastic team arentwe james didntanswer for a long time lily watched the biggest most heartfelt grin spread out onto his face and she supposed she must have said something meaningful although james tried to reply as though he had known they would manage it all along of course lilo he said we re a marvellous team a n hello i know a lot of people were irritated about the last cliff hanger but i hope the tremendous amount of fluff in this chapter made up for

anyway thank you all it been much fun cheers three the early chicken it was only once lily had stormed up to the heads dorm run through the hall up the stairs into her room locking the door behind her and slumped against the panelling that she fully realised what her outburst at rita skeeter had made her do oh bugger she muttered quietly sliding down the door and laying her head on her knees she d really done it now she thought miserably not only did she now have to learn how to fly but she had to have james potter teaching her of all people and to make matters worse she d announced it in front of the whole school so there was no way she could back out of it now a few knocks echoed through the heads dorms making lily jump clear out of her skin lily frowned who would want to talk to their head girl now everyone was still at dinner and potter knew the password unless he was trying to get her to come down and talk to him no even he wasntso stupid as to force lily to talk when she was pissed off that was just suicide lily got shakily to her feet as if she d been at the ogden s opened the door to the stairs and went down into the hall regarding the double doors suspiciously taking her wand out of her bag that she d dumped by it she muttered transparencia and drew a small rectangle on the wood the wood seemed to vanish presenting her with a pair of hawk like eyes and a mop of dirty blonde spiky hair it me you silly billy called verity from the other side of the door dontyou know by now that i the only one who can see you in this state without needing a cremation appointment lily smiled and sighed opening the door verity stood holding a tray with some dinner on it grinning she swept into the room and put it down on the coffee table hey nice she exclaimed gazing round blimey this place is dolled up for one of the queen garden parties innit yeah lily agreed picking up a blt from the tray her friend had brought wanna tour while i tell you what happened she asked with her mouth full spraying bits of lettuce on the carpet i thought you d never ask verity said smiling and looping her arm through lily s all through dinner people kept coming to congratulate james on his finding a new seeker for his team of course there were a few and there was me thinking it was your lucky day mate and also a few are you sure you re still going to be alive after this year and of course a few i cannot believe you chose her and not me mark my words potter you ll be sorry hey what are you gerroff me you haventheard the last of meeeeee he been needing help for years remarked remus skewering a tomato on his fork i wonder what caused lily to change her mind said peter thoughtfully a tone that was extremely rare to be caught coming out of his mouth and by rights should have been put in a museum the way a girl mind works is a mystery as deep as a well wormtail ol buddy sirius said and should only be attempted to be understood by fully qualified deadly stunt wizards he turned his eyes to his best friend james was staring off into space as if all his thought processes had been put in a deepfreeze are you conscious prongs asked remus with a slightly amused look on his face james blinked and jerked his head round to look at all his friends yeah yeah she said softly it just his face cracked into a grin that looked as if it was going to swallow up his whole head i going to teach lily evans how to fly sirius rolled his eyes and put a finger to his ear zzzz yes is this w i s e we ve lost contact with voyager prongs18 repeat we vee lost contact with prongs18 save your carbon dioxide emissions padfoot he was long gone ages ago grinned remus earning himself a small back handed smack from the boy in question a shadow fell across their table and everyone including james looked up curiously amos diggory was standing with his arms folded over his chest looking like he wanted to take something outside can we help you sirius asked with a look on his face that suggested he was talking to a bucket of mouldy frogspawn actually yes you can the hufflepuff said with suppressed anger bubbling through his voice he wasnttalking to sirius he was talking to james oh brilliant remus said cheerfully yeah agreed james we can either help you leave help you get some anger management or help you drown yourself in the lake the choice is yours diggory lunged forward slamming his palms on the table and knocked over a bowl of kiwis he leaned into james face as james stared calmly back with a slightly curious look on his face the population of the hall spun round ceasing all talk to watch most of them couldntbelieve their luck two seventh year spats in one day this was just too entertaining look potter diggory spat i am not having a perverted freak like you going anywhere near my lily any more than necessary it dangerous enough for her to share heads duties with you merlin knows what goes on in yout mind at night with her only a few metres away but you teaching her to fly is going too far if you dontmind i will be teaching lily how to fly not you james lowered his hazel eyes from diggory watery blue ones and located a napkin lying in on the table a little way away he picked it up perfectly calmly removed his glasses and started wiping off all the spit flecks that had accumulated on his lenses through diggory rant tossing the napkin back on the table he replaced his glasses and regarded the hufflepuff for a few seconds thank you for that diggory i touched that you think me impulsive enough to try anything on lily but the fact is i ve been in love with your girlfriend for close on six years and i ve been living within a few metres of her for nearly seven despite this i sure far more perverse twisted and disturbing things have gone on in your mind at night even with you all the way on the other side of this castle so you know thanks but no thanks james said pleasantly i wasnt asking you not to touch my girlfriend potter i was telling you that you won t diggory said poisonously james stood up causing diggory to jump backwards off the gryffindor table rather quickly yes well that funny isntit james said his voice rising a few notches it funny how you can assume lily your possession your property he said disgustedly but guess again diggory because she not and neither is it your business to decide whom she wants to touch her and whom she doesn t and of course it not your right to decide who teaches lily to fly now i offered her a place on my team for our house and there is no way in the horrors of azkaban that i putting the education of my seeker in the hands of some pretty boy hufflepuff so i sure you ll understand why i have to tell you to take your request and go strangle yourself with it enough came a voice from the direction of the top table mcgonagall was standing next to diggory and the boys hadnteven noticed her stride towards them though their argument what a repulsive display of inter house competition gone astray she said sharply you ought to be ashamed of yourself mr diggory picking a fight with the head boy and you mr potter should not have answered back now miss evans will be taught the art of flying by mr potter as she requested only fifteen minutes ago and i will be taking twenty points from hufflepuff and five from gryffindor good evening to you both loopy loo as james entered the heads dorms he saw verity close the door to lily staircase and grin at him howdy she said cheerfully as james walked over to one of the sofas and flopped down exhaustedly how lilo asked james taking off his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose she a tad upset said verity gently throwing herself down next to james and settling her trainers on the coffee table she regrets saying yes to you and she knows she canttake it back because she fears the wrath of gryffindors everywhere what happened to you you re supposed to be jumping for joy you ve just got yourself a seeker oh it nothing james said diggory just went all over protective and psycho on me accusing me of being a perv and telling me not to touch his girlfriend you know personally i think he a psycho too and a wanker at that a panicked expression crossed verity face you wonttell her i said that will you she ll be after my blood your secret safe with me hooch i ve only just found myself a seeker i dontwant my chasers popping off left right and centre you should probably pray lily doesntkill you this year then grinned verity so why did she say yes asked james chucking his glasses next to verity feet aw that evil skeeter girl got up her nose saying she wouldntbe able to handle the pressure merlin what a cow muttered james i ll say agreed verity so what the plan lover boy how re you gonna make it worth lily while huh merlin knows james said miserably oh this is awful if lily feeling crap about it then i hate the idea i canthave her on the team if she gonna hate it and hate me for it what am i gonna do verity he asked hopelessly james come on man verity said a bit worried get a grip everything gonna fine you ll see i sure with you teaching her she ll love playing as much as you do dontworry she wontregret it for long yeah yeah he grinned tomorrow saturday we ll start then er maybe you should wai started verity cringing slightly but james had already jumped up from the sofa and skipped off to his staircase verity hooch you re a star what would i do without you he asked and closed the door behind him well you probably wouldntbe looking up various counter curses in the library tomorrow verity answered slipping out of the double doors james was decidedly nervous as he banged the doorknocker on lily door the next morning swallowing he gripped the handles of the two brooms he was carrying in his left hand and got himself in the right frame of mind should he need to duck for any reason he d gotten up ridiculously early that morning washed dressed attacked his hair with especial care and gone down to the kitchens to ask for the blackest and most disgusting coffee he d ever drunk to make him awake enough to face lily he gave a small gasp as lily wrenched open the door in her nightdress and fluffy slippers holding a wand and looking as if she would have liked to have a shotgun under her arm james though it should be made a criminal offence to be that gorgeous this early in the morning it took her a few seconds to recognise him while she groggily focused her brilliantly green irises then she took a deep breath and said potter you have exactly three seconds to tell me why you are rousing me from my lovely bed at the sinful hour of seven a m on a saturday before i knock you out cut your skull open and scramble your brains with an egg whisk go she ordered flying lesson james said quickly quidditch pitch come on lily stared at him you have got to be joking she said hoarsely potter it saturday morning it freezing she trailed off unable to think of another reason and i hate you good enough why in the name of my lovely warm cosy bed would i come out with you because you re going to need a lot of practice at flying if you want to get good enough to kick serious arse as you told me yesterday and i want to teach you as well as i can so as you can make a complete fool of that cow rita skeeter who insulted you lily raised her wand to his throat i dontknow how you found out about that but i want you never to speak of it again of course my dear lilo now go and get dressed james said before lily sent him an irritated look and slammed the door in his face and dontwear a skirt he shouted through the door as an afterthought thankfully it wasntwindy but it was still cold enough to make you want an extra half hour in bed if it had been a monday morning and lily wouldntstop grumbling all the way down to the pitch come on lilo it not that bad james said reasonably here he pulled out his wand plucked two blades of grass from the ground and transfigured them into a pair of red silk gloves and a matching scarf thank you potter she said sarcastically but if you hadntdragged me down here in the first place then i would have no need for you to show off your transfiguration skills anyway wow an underhanded compliment james smiled this is progress no it not i still hate you more than anyone else in the entire world you re such a charming pleasant conversationalist laughed james trying to hand her the gloves and scarf but she wasnthaving any of it only to people who deserve it she answered forcing him to drape the scarf round her neck and yank her hands out of their folded position to tug the gloves on there he said finally slipping her last little finger into its place better i suppose so she said resignedly a little of the annoyance had worn off from that morning and she was starting to realise that it wasnttoo bad being out in the cool fresh air on a saturday morning with james he was being quite sweet to her as well and she really was finding the whole situation tolerable but only as long as her fingers were toasty of course they d arrived at the quidditch pitch and james had tossed the brooms he was holding down on the grass lily stared at them with a mistrustful expression fiddling with the tasselled end of her scarf right you take that one james said pointing to the smaller thinner one of the two lily had hoped he wouldntsay that that a sparrow sixteen good for small light people like you and i know he said holding up a gloved finger that you have an extremely fast metabolism lily tried to hide the beginning of a small exhaled laugh but failed huzzah james thought delightedly she can laugh so i sure you know this already but the first thing you have to do is stand to the left of your broom and say up lily sighed and complied up she muttered moodily the broom didntmove james regarded her carefully come on lily try again he told her up she said in a tone a little more forceful the broom twitched james sighed look maybe rita skeeter is right he said slowly ex cuse me asked lily after blinking at him i dunno maybe you canthandle the pressure i should have known you wouldntmeasure up to me maybe i should offer the position to rita instead what demanded the head girl her hand still suspended over the broom in shock wassamatter evans scared i telling the truth scared you ll never be as fantastic as me he asked mockingly shut up she shouted frowning in anger and a loud smack was heard through the pitch it may be sensible to assume that lily had hit james because he really was asking for it and she was actually thinking of doing so but before she could draw her hand back something had slapped into her palm and her fingers had automatically closed around it she gaped at james for a second before looking down to discover the sparrow sixteen had leapt into her hand looking back at the head boy she saw he was smiling craftily with none of the formal malice in his hazel eyes and holding his hand over his own broom and that is the tone you need to use when getting your broom into your hand he said cleverly up he ordered in the same tone and the broom fell into his palm just like lily had now i want you to mount it lily obeyed without much thought as she was still temporarily shell shocked from what had just happened against her better judgement she was feeling an odd kind of relief that james hadntmeant all those things he d said the reason she was so shocked was that he d never said anything exceptionally nasty to her nasty things he used to say to other people on a regular basis but in fact it was a long time since he d said anything nasty to anyone who didntdeserve it now to get it to go up you need to kick off from the ground and raise the handle slightly lily obeyed but not completely because as soon as she jerked the handle upwards her broom didntrise but tipped backwards scaring her out of her wits if it werentfor james quick reflexes she would have slipped off backwards had he not grabbed the handle and pulled her back down dont lean back he told her as she nodded fearfully otherwise if you re quick enough you ll flip right over now stay very still while i show you the head girl sat stock still as james looked her in the eye for trust and gently pushed the handle up and down up and down up and down until it looked as if lily was sitting in a bobbing little row boat on the atlantic are you ok with that he asked finally lily nodded now to make it go you lean forward just a bit and keep you handle steady the faster you want to go the further forward you lean makes sense lily nodded she seemed to be doing a lot of that lately as for james her lack of words was a little unnerving this must have been the absolute longest he hadntbeen shouted at it was nice if a bit strange lily was starting to realise that james quite a good teacher she had read books about flying as she had thought it was an extremely complicated process involving unbalanced forces various aspects of aerodynamics and newton second law of motion and lily had mused that it sounded about as difficult and dangerous as tightrope walking blindfolded on a piece of sewing thread above a pool full of poisonous sea urchins but james made it so simple he laid down the facts clearly and definitely like doing this makes it do this but doing this makes it chuck you off soon lily was able to grab a certain sense of the broom and its behavioural patterns and correspondingly james stopped giving instructions and started giving tests although she would rather curse herself to sprout boils rather than admit it to james lily was having quite a bit of fun and soon james had mounted his own broom and said do you want to play follow the leader do i want to play what sorry asked lily follow the leader james repeated it a game we play sometime in practices improves hand eye brain coordination so what i have to go wherever you go asked lily exactly you up for it he asked in voice that made it plain he wasntgoing to go easy on her of course potter she said in voice that made it plain she was up for anything i ve decided i rather like flying and i guessing i would like playing even more yes she likes flying james whooped inside as a huge rush flew through his body all righty then he said with a grin he drew his broom handle up and zoomed towards the sky hearing lily whizzing along behind him thinking fast he sped up and lily fell behind she soon caught up though just as james had started zigzagging between the goal posts james tried everything he could think of loops barrel rolls dives but he couldntseem to shake her off each stunt taught her something new about flying and made james more delighted than ever with his find for the team by now his speed was constantly extremely fast as fast as the snitch in fact which was very very good if she could keep this up nervously he flattened himself completely against his broom levelling his knees with the tail and his speed reached new heights he was going to need it if he wanted to pull this off when he d tried this with the team none of them had made it so james sped towards the middle hoop without much hope making sure he was exactly in line he banished his fears chucked a little prayer to whichever heavenly beings just happened to be watching and closed his eyes soon he felt the whoosh of the hoop around him and breathed as he felt it skim the top of his head rising up above it he turned to see lily flat against her broom elbows in scarf streaming out behind her and held his breath as she flew through the hoop like a piece of red thread going through the eye of a very small needle panting she came to his level and laughed at the look on his face was that it she asked teasingly n no james said quickly of course not he dived again going with the most random path and spotted the lake it glistened with an air of innocence and james zipped towards it hearing lily laughing behind him soon she stopped it was clear he was going too near the water and he wasntstopping lily let her competitive streak get the better of her and continued to follow him but the blue kept getting nearer and near until james was almost splashing into the water like a game of chicken james toes skimmed the water sending ripples gliding across the surface lily stopped beside him staring at the water beneath her dark eyelashes and breathing hard he cheeks were pink behind her freckles wisps of hair had escaped from her plait and there was an exhilarated smile on her face she looked at him with her eyes sparkling and james was sure that in that second his brain must have evaporated inside his skull well done he said at last you won that night lily was busy in the heads dorms completing her charms homework verity was sprawled across the purple sofa her nose buried in a witch weekly did you know she asked lily her eyes still stuck to the article that taking a leisurely fly around your local quidditch pitch or park is beneficial for the skin and prevents acne no i didn t actually smiled lily draping ivy round a shoebox that served as a fairy den she d gotten the idea from the set of a play she d once been to see a midsummer nights dream but because her shoe box was so small and her little fairy models half the size of her forefinger she d had to make her ivy smaller as well so she hoped she d get extra marks for that maybe potter should have given the seeker position to hortensia midgeon instead no i dontthink so said verity offhandedly i think it been very beneficial for your face what asked lily placing a tiny titania on a swing of ivy hanging from the ceiling of the shoebox well you haventstopped smiling all day verity said i starting to think you re bribing madam pomfrey for a secret stash of morphine verity you know if i had any morphine i d share it with you lily grinned slipping the lid onto her shoebox and writing her name and house on it duh verity agreed so what happened with your first flying lesson give me all the juicy details if there had been any juicy details lily wouldnthave been able to give them because there was a knock at the double doors verity flipped her magazine shut and flipped herself onto her stomach so she had a view of the door lily levered open the door curiously and said oh i was wondering when you d come to see me amos diggory swept past her looking as tense as springs on a trampoline well i off lily verity said taking a very clear hint as to where she wasntwanted bye ver see you at breakfast said lily handing her friend her magazine and watching her slip out the door no sooner had verity arrived on the other side of the doors than she had crouched down and glued her ear to the wood inside the heads dorms amos was pacing lily watching him with a serene look on her face so what happened he finally asked standing still for the first time in thirty seconds lily wondered where her hello kiss was oh no things were bad when amos she asked calmly today yesterday this morning the night of the belgian invasion of the 1242 troll tribe wars this morning amos said sharply in your flying lesson with potter lily sighed you have no need to worry she said it was early it was freezing and i learnt quite a bit did he try anything asked amos his voice getting angrier for some reason no you know if he had he d be in the hospital wing by now with his fingers in a pickling jug on his bedside table are you sure asked amos furiously lily was confused it was as if amos was deliberately trying to find some sort of misdemeanour in james behaviour but there had been nothing lily thought suddenly nothing to hold against him yes i sure she said starting to get irritated james was a perfect gentleman oh a perfect gentleman asked amos acting as if it was an interrogation starting to think quite highly of that stupid arsehole now are you what right this second well compared to you yes i am lily shouted then she gaped she d never shouted at amos before usually all her shouting was spent on james amos she said quickly what the matter with you why are you acting like this she started to walk towards him but he backed away with a repulsed look on his face he didnteven answer her question lily i hope you understand why i dontwant to see you again he said coldly on opposite sides of the same door both at the same time lily and verity gasped a n w i s e not canon dontworry invented by me and stands for wizard international space exploration writers desert has finally been scaled or at least i hope so i luff my reviewers so so so so much you have no idea ok let me try and explain to you how much you people cheer me up today i lost my phone and i was in such a mess you donteven understand i was suffering hot flushes crying on the floor shaking with fear and anguish wondering what in the name of all hell was i going to do without a phone this weekend my phone is like my gateway to my friends ie my real family anyway then i phoned a lovely person called emily on jackie phone and she told me that i last had my phone in the language lab and did she want me to go down and check if it was there the short and short of it was that she found it and i was once again with phone and happiness it was like being reunited with all my best friends at once and the hugs from my friends in joy were a perk as well anyway the feeling i get when i read all the reviews one by one is like finding the contacts on my phone again one by one and when i log onto ff net and see how many reviews you lovely people have left me it feels like i found my phone again wasntthat an inspirational story frighteninglyobsessed omg original is the best compliment that a harry

happy only secret entertaining cheers muchly people dontseem to like rita i think it a general feeling milky way bar it because everyone left over from the last fic i think if this were my first fic it would not have nearly as many notes i think mika mitch ah the joy of randomage it brings light into my life ljstagflower4e sadly lily wasntthere for the flipping out but no matter there shall be plenty of confrontation to come yay for drama anne janet delighted i glad i delight people how lovely tea d kyki rivera it is really jade sierra snape thanks for the note i tried to hurry up but it didntreally work oh well megaroony me either red emerald oh yes i down with the vibes i am indeed i ve always wanted to say something like that to an entire hall full of people and sirius is cool so i thought it would be ic for him to do i glad you thought there was emotion in my lines it is a pretty immense thought because if james hated lily forever would we even have a series of books i think not oh there ll be lots more rita she god awful but sadly essential to the plot charbar cheering people up is a good thing for me to do i feel little details rock they re so funny thanks for the review foxyie xox how is rita gonna get at lily oooooooh you have no idea grins evilly smay will i make lily and james end up together well the answer to that is i may or i may not i probably depends on my mood when i writing the end of this fic you know i could be nice or i could be soul shatteringly cruel right at the end when you thought everything was going to work out ok so the thing what you have to do is keep reviewing and cheering me up so i have good vibes to write the last chapter with when i eventually get around to the last chapter that is thanks for your note honey padfoot1987 i

when people do that i used to do that i mean write people desperately off character i have a shameful history of mary sues as well it terrible to think i actually wrote things like that uuuurg you really are starting this fic off with a bang and it should continue smoothly from here are you joking smoothly trust me for hereon in things are anything but smooth d loved the use of savvy in the story omg the word savvy deserves to be enshrined in gold and draped across tower bridge rita skeeter we all may hate her but i am glad that she inadvertedly got lily and james together yes i know that hasnt happened yet but i jsut have this hunch that they will you have a hunch eh well go look at what i wrote to smay there still time for it all to go horribly wrong you know descripton was fabulous and i think it would be futher enriched by throwin in some similes and metaphors thank you luff right similes and metaphors similes and metaphors you are developing these characters wonderfully why thank you i am hard pressed to find a story as good as this one keep going on with this your doing great i luff you next chappy er hello what is with that guy amos i mean who cursed his broomstick i sure i dontknow boys are such a mystery how do you get your own back on someone who slates your sweetheart well are you a marauder or not who afraid of the big bad rita er me for one everyone else just seems to hate her lastly guess how many courseworks i have pending go on guess and if you feel like it guess what subjects they are if any four oozing charm wassamatter somebody asked from verity right she hurriedly looked up to the head boy frowning curiously at her verity pushed out a noise of extreme irritation as though she were dealing with a difficult child fine it may be just acceptable to ask why someone was squatting with their ear sewed to a door but verity was trying to hear what was being said in the other side of wood honestly some people were just sooo inconsiderate shhhh she ordered and the confused expression on james face deepened tutting verity flapped her hand in a sign that said she wanted him to get down to her level james crouched down as well and put his ear to the door although he couldnthear a thing and was starting to think that verity was on the run from representatives from st mungo mental ward whatever you do dontopen this door hissed verity why asked james curiously well if you must know verity continued lily in there with amos oh james said wrinkling his nose in a revolted expression he was just about to get up and ask what in the world verity was doing eavesdropping on such a situation and had half a mind to accidentally walk in and interrupt whatever was going on in there when verity hissed like a goose again not like that you sicko diggory just stormed up here wanting to know what you and lily had been doing all morning she said nothing had happened which it didn t in case you were wondering james put in i know you re a perfect gentleman james lily said so herself but she told diggory to calm down and asked why he was acting like such a frigging prat and just now he told her he doesntwanna see her anymore verity completed by the end of her narration james mouth was slightly open bloody hell he muttered quietly shifting his position she he could get a better ear press what a nasty bastard oh dontpretend you re not happy about this james verity said dismissively james grinned it was worth a try on the other side of the door after a long silence he picked out lily saying in a weak voice i sorry amos blew out of his nostrils in annoyance i said i dontwant to see you again he repeated in a rock hard tone why asked lily she wasntupset she was more bewildered it a lot of things amos said shortly apparently not bothering to elaborate on it i just cantsee you anymore well i dontknow why you re bothering now lily said in an irritated tone the anger was slowly settling in i think i would like you to leave amos thank you he replied as if she were doing him a favour like startled pigeons james and verity jumped away from the door as if it had just been infested with flesh eating bacteria they darted a little way down the corridor and hid behind a suit of armour watching as diggory emerged from the head dorms and disappeared down the hall in the opposite direction once his footsteps had stopped reaching their ears and james had stopped miming the action of throwing daggers at his back he and verity stepped out from behind their hiding place and james started jogging towards the double doors oi what do you think you re doing demanded verity grabbing his sleeve and holding him back james struggled for all he was worth but it was no go i going in there he declared dangerously i have to i need to you have to you need to what james asked verity listen lily not in the best of moods right now and you putting it extremely mildly are not one of her favourite people so if you want to be out of the hospital wing to see your first match i d recommend staying out here while i pack her up and make sure she up her staircase and then i ll come down and let you know when the coast is lilo free all right i suppose james said while he gave the password and allowed verity to slip into his dorm once the door had clicked shut he sighed in a hopeless way what verity had said was completely true of course he couldntjust march in there and try to comfort lily she hated him he wasnther friend he had no social standing with her whatsoever that would keep her from either closing herself off or cursing him her love life had nothing to do with him except for the fact that the thing he wanted most was for it to revolve around him and she wanted about as much to do with him as a professional wizards gardener wanted to do with gnomes there was nothing he could do to make lily feel better yes there was at the click of the door lily spun round to face whoever had entered she had been expecting james and had been preparing to flee up her stairs but she had probably never been more relieved to see verity in her life hey lils whispered verity i donthave anything to say said lily sadly to him or to anyone now she had no one to be angry at it seemed all her anger had left the room with diggory god how she detested feeling miserable come on let get you into bed verity said once lily was down under her quilt with her hair snaking among the folds of her pillow verity sat at the foot of the bed and sighed if it any consolation i always hated him she remarked verity exclaimed lily shame on you that not making me feel any better sorry apologised verity fiddling with the quilt actually yes it is grinned lily say it again please verity sighed theatrically as if the conversation were taking place fifteen seconds later you know i always hated him she repeated this time though a smile on her face you know lily asked closing her eyes and rolling onto her side me too as verity skipped down the stairs she found herself not feeling at all sorry for lily well maybe a little sorry for all the time she d wasted on that pillock but otherwise quite optimistic in her eyes as well as everyone else probably it was obvious james was completely smitten with lily from absolutely ages ago and it was amazing what sort of good it had done him he d stopped cursing people in the hallways for instance when lily had yelled at him to consider how he would feel if he was cursed in the hallways for no apparent reason he d stopped acting like he owned the school when lily had shouted at him saying if that was the case she d have attempted to plant a couple of bombs under it by now he d also stopped acting like he was higher than everyone else because lily had screamed at him that he wasntmore elevated or mightier than anyone else he was in fact lower for thinking so verity remembered with a smile how lily d proved she was mightier than james any day by flinging the mightiest purple humpback curse that hogwarts had seen in a good many years at him struggling to cover up her sniggers verity opened the double doors of the heads dorm seeking the object of her musings where d he go she thought puzzled the corridor was as deserted as professor vector arithmancy club on friday evenings poor vector didntrealise most students actually had a life after whispering james name for about thirty seconds and expecting him to jump out from behind a suit of armour just to terrify her verity shrugged and closed the door with a faint click she then went up lily stairs to root through her closet in search of the head girl spare nightdress and prepared herself for a night on the downstairs sofa psst oi wake up the fat lady jiggled awake in her portrait like a plate of raspberry flavoured jelly in the midst of an earthquake vi shove those golf balls back in the teapot and fix your lipstick she shouted as she blinked bemusedly james raised an eyebrow pardon me he asked dear merlin if he was ever painted as a portrait and hung up on a hogwarts wall he hoped he would never find out what that was all about oh it you potter the fat lady said dontyou know it incredibly rude and bad mannered to wake someone when they re sleeping well in all honesty madam grinned james i ve not had any experience in waking anyone when they re unconscious or dead would that be more courteous oh you scolded the fat lady good naturedly anyway what have come down here for in case you haventnoticed or maybe you re drunk you dontlive here anymore aha but my best friends do james said in a crafty voice would you mind awfully keeping a secret for us my dear head boy the fat lady said with her hand to her bosom the entire reason i here is because i can keep secrets you dontsee me blurting the password to everyone i meet do you now spill the gossip well you know lily evans the new head girl started james before he was interrupted do i indeed laughed the fat lady lapping up the gossip like a kitten laps milk such a dear always so polite never went around waking people who were happily asleep yeah all right said james giving his glasses a gentle shove further up his nose anyway that dickhead amos diggory just broke up with her her best friend told me oh good exclaimed the fat lady never liked him awfully rude got quite shirty with me one time when i wouldntlet him in he said he wanted to see lily but i was having none of it you re an inspiration to us all james said monotonously moving on he was a wanker to her just now and mr black mr lupin mr pettigrew and i want to show our appreciation that he decided to leave her alone at last you especially no doubt the fat lady said in an amused calculating look i can see it all over your face leave it out james said pointedly there no need to say the password in that voice potter the fat lady said go on get in get out and dontcome back until diggory drowning in his own humiliation ten minutes later all four marauders were slipping out of the portrait hole with the map in front of their noses i ve always liked giving thank you presents mused sirius with a smile as they strolled through the castle is lily all right remus asked did you see her no james said suddenly miserable verity barred me from the dorm until she d bundled lilliputian up her stairs she must be quite upset then he added after a sad pause ah well sirius said we ll just have to make sure that whatever we do to diggory tonight is funny enough to cheer her up eh yeah james said glumly or at least funny enough to cheer him up remus whispered to sirius and peter sunday was usually a half day at hogwarts most students didntget up till just before lunch time so the house elves had taken to serving breakfast four hours later than they would have on any other day the rest of the day was usually taken up with homework or ignoring it as the recipient may choose so just after one o clock that sunday the population of hogwarts was making sleepy conversation at the late breakfast table i cannot believe you slept on the sofa last night lily sighed to verity the girls were sitting with the marauders because lily didnthave the heart to argue with anyone today least of all verity who had been as sweet as syrup to her last night how can you not believe it asked verity in the middle of devouring a plate of scones topped with strawberry jam you were the one who woke me up by chucking a load of icy water on my head i really sorry about that lily said you wouldntwake up why was that d you think i honestly have no clue verity said hoping she wasntletting on that when the marauders had crashed into the heads dorm late last night she had weaselled their plan out of them well mostly remus then after james had gone up to bed and sirius peter and remus had left for the gryffindor tower there had been a knock at the door and when she had tossed the covers off her and opened it the latter had been standing there with an incredibly embarrassed painfully shy expression on his face remus is dead tired too peter said turning the attention to the boy opposite him who was rocking back and forth alternately staring at verity and nodding forward in exhaustion when he heard his name his head snapped up and he started looking for the coffee mug bloody hell james said smiling you re right he completely conked out i have no comment for any of you the poor boy muttered sloshing black coffee straight down his throat much to the disgust of most of his company lily smiled however when she saw verity was not even the slightest bit appalled and was secretly gazing at remus with what may be termed as more tenderness than the meat of a free range chicken it made her a bit sick actually after the whole fiasco with amos with considerable more caffeine in his bloodstream remus seemed to be doing all right for the rest of breakfast and he even started laughing when something entered the great hall that did not look human it looked like amos diggory fair enough but he seemed to be covered in some sort of thick green translucent gloop that left a thin trail of sticky mess wherever he went he didntnotice when various eating implements went clattering onto plates as people dropped them in shock because a first year gryffindor had just run into the hall slipped on the gloop trail on the floor and went crashing into him diggory spun round flinging large splats of see through gunge onto the ravenclaw table whose occupants pulled faces in revulsion and glared at the first year who squealed and jumped backwards staring at his green slimy hands what the sod the matter with you diggory demanded angrily look where you re going and go take a shower he held up his arms inspecting himself all over good thing you didntget any on me you little twat mr diggory exclaimed professor sprout standing up from the high table in anger such language will not be tolerated apologise to mr court immediately diggory frowned and looked up form the horror struck first year to find the whole hall staring at him his head of house orders were drowned out by his indignation these people were looking at him as if he had been cursed or something what are you all looking at he demanded of the hall out of the corner of her eye lily just caught james nip out his wand and mutter finne persona sola transparencia diggory was patting his face in worry he had something stuck to it but on his third pat his hand went splat yelling in wordless terror he looked down and spun round a few times trying to see where it all was where it was all coming from the laughter in the hall was as loud as the crowd at small saturday morning quidditch matches even the mucky first year was laughing as diggory ran out of the hall james stood up and started clapping shouting a round of applause ladies and gentlemen please that was amos diggory now officially the biggest slime ball on the planet a huge ovation was added to the laughter in the hall as the ravenclaws smiled and performed cleaning charms on their crockery james sat down and glanced at lily he found her staring at him her expression unreadable then she frowned slightly and turned back to her plate picking up an apple from the fruit bowl and leaving the hall verity stared at the marauders who were watching her go she bit her lip when they turned back to her i think that was pushing it she said worriedly lily gathered her robes around her shins as she gingerly stepped over the gunge left by her former boyfriend urgh sometimes james was just ghastly and irritating at the same time what had he been thinking now everyone would figure out that amos had broken up with her and all hell would break loose probably she glared at a patch of slime that hung dripping off the banister of a staircase then she got back to finding her way to the heads dorms and took stock of her surroundings bugger the problem with living in a place that had moving staircases apart from the fact that it gave you quite a shock the first time stone moved from under your feet was that it was like being a foreigner suddenly being plonked in the middle of the london underground certain staircases went to certain floors and you could only get to a certain platform using certain staircases that could be found coming from certain corridors and then you had to know when they did this and this could be certain times of the day certain weeks in a month or even certain years in a century lily sighed as she sat herself down on a step propped her chin up with her hand elbow on her knee and waited for the staircase to move to the corridor she wanted all the while staring at the green gunge that oozed to the carpet in a thin icky thread filch was definitely going to kill james for this serves the git right thought lily bitterly the stairs started moving with a jerk and lily hand flew out from under her chin to steady herself right into a puddle of gloop eeewww she thought getting even more irritated what an idiot he shouldnthave pulled such a completely thoughtless joke the staircase came to a halt and lily got up wanting to get to a basin as fast as she could and wash her hand stupid immature childish tactless joke she fumed until all her steam had been blown off and she had arrived at the heads dorms reaching for the door knob with her clean hand she stopped and held up her left rubbing the jelly like gloop gently between her finger and smiled slightly remembering the look on amos face when he caught sight of himself bloody funny though she thought and entered her room to find some tissues that night james knocked on the door of lily staircase and chewed his lip nervously the door opened and he was met with the expressionless face of lily the look on her face went from neutral to hostile faster than a goose when some innocent toddler wonders over to regent park duck pond with a fist full of bread what do you want she asked resignedly as if the sight of him had just ruined her day james was determined to un ruin it though so he presented her with a bit of paper mcgonagall came to find me today she says we have the first rounds tonight before we can deal them out to the prefects tomorrow he said not mentioning he had actually asked for that night slot so he could have a chance to talk to lily without a door in her hands that she could slam in his face her wondrous green eyes scanned the deputy headmistress handwriting after which she shoved it back against james chest and turned around tutting i going to get my cloak she called irritably james took a deep breath and wished himself luck he thought he should give her a little time to calm down and get all the thoughts of taking her wand to him out of her head before he said anything at all but he was finding it quite hard to walk alongside lily when she was angry at him and he could actually do something to fix it look lilo about this morning i didnt really overdo it did i i think you did potter lily said coldly the fact that you would think about doing something like that is overdoing it did you think i needed cheering up or something that i would be sad because some prick decided he wanted to stomp all over my heart that i d be heartbroken because someone thought he d destroy two years of my unquestioned attention at the drop of a hat that i d be upset because i feel i ve wasted the last two years with someone who wasnteven worth a second look james didntwant lie to her so he didn t well to be honest lilo you do sound quite sad heartbroken and upset james said in quite earnest well i not shouted lily not caring that she might wake up a few people james may have promised himself never to lie to lily but she was lying to him now he could see it written all over her face ok lilo whatever you say james said soothingly i sorry about today i was only trying to get my own back and cheer you up a bit but it looks like you didntneed cheering up apparently you re fine are you saying i not demanded lily no you re telling me you re not thought james i can read your feelings all over your face not if you say you re not he said wow he could become minister of magic with all this diplomatic talking he was doing and what the frig do you mean get my own back she asked again in the same tone james thwacked himself mentally with a sledgehammer he hadntrealised that had slipped out i wanted to pay him back for the way he treated you like you said he threw two years of your hard work in the bin i donteven know how you found out about all this lily accused him and you know what i donteven want to know i know you have that cloak and the map you were probably in the room i wouldntdo that james said calmly maybe two years ago i would have but not now of course not lily said sarcastically no seriously verity told me last night when i came back james explained tactfully leaving out the bit where he and verity were eavesdropping she told you lily asked james nodded oh they had neared the end of their rounds as they had arrived at the entrance hall and from there it was up to the heads dorms again i really sorry james said again about everything you know that dontyou lily looked at him for a moment and james was pretty sure that he was displaying all his thoughts on his face for her to read i know will you forgive me one day she looked away maybe hey look james said as they passed the notice board hogsmeade next weekend will you come with me he said out of habit half hopeful as usual lily looked at the notice and her eyes widened it was a shock but for a moment there she had seriously considered saying yes maybe it was because during her first day in two years without a boyfriend she missed having one to the extent that anyone would do maybe it was because after such a long time with the same person she wanted something short and meaningless which james would undoubtedly give her his other girlfriends hadntlasted long frowning lily slapped herself inside she had just come out of something really big and this was a perfect excuse to refuse no she said with half hearted indignation what is wrong with you sorry james said quietly ashamedly as lily raised her hand wearily to rub her eyes that really had been the wrong thing to say as it always was merlin she looked really tired wondering if he would get away with it he carefully put his arm round her shoulders and steered her along the notice board lily leaned against his shoulder too tired to chinese burn the offending arm or curse it off it had been an awful day and oddly some of the awfulness seemed to evaporate in such close proximity to james maybe it was the reassurance that no matter what happened some people and their feelings towards you always stayed the same lily was about ready drop off there on the head boy shoulder but as she blinked in exhaustion her eyes caught on her name somewhere in the passing notice board if she were rushing past it she may have thought it was a list of prefects or something but it wasn t it was a copy of hogwarts hearsay like a shot she jumped off james shoulder and grabbed the piece of parchment tacked to the cork panel a new one appeared in it place as lily scanned the contents gasped in horror and took off towards the heads dorm shooting james a hateful look as she ran lily james shouted lily and ran after her when she didntturn round he caught her just as she was opening the door to her staircase the notice crumpled in her hand and anger blotching her face lily what wrong what the mat he started but stopped when she pulled out her wand he d had enough bad experiences with that swishy ten and a quarter inch willow to last him his lifetime and wasntabout to start on his afterlife this is what happens when you do unthinking brainless stunts like you did this morning she hissed slapping the notice on the front of her door and stabbing the top with her wand leaving a shiny golden tack there then she slammed the door and left james staring at the notice and it contents lily evans and amos diggory hogwarts most famous couple have split as reporter for hogwarts hearsay rita skeeter has discovered on the saturday night diggory visited the heads dorms intending to visit his girlfriend only to find her in a passionate snog with the head boy james potter james didntneed to read any more to know that he was in the deepest shite he d ever been in with lily before swearing colourfully under his breath he slammed his forearms against the wood of her door and banged his head against it swearing louder when he pulled his head back baring the imprint of a tack on his forehead a n it is so weird to be in on a saturday night i haventbeen in a saturday night for five weeks five weeks ago i was at jackie party then i went to barcelona then i went to katie s then i went to holly esther and liberty party and then i went to see the killers i beginning to forget what my parents look like oh well the answer to my petite guessing game was that i have 5 courseworks five that f i v e five cinque cinco pente more specifically history religion physics art and english fabulous call sugarhigh police join me in my bid to get savvy enshrined someone should start an email petition sabine strohem moss yes years from now old ladies will be huddled around their tea muttering in a smug tone the exact words you used i never did like him anyway d the original meathead right let go through this methodically will the flying lessons help her to understand how much james likes quidditch i think that they ll definitely help and will it help her realise how good at quidditch james really is and that he actually has a reason to be arrogant about his quidditch skills ditto and how will the other team members react when they see how much of a natural lily is i dunno they ll probably assume james worked his arse off to teach her because of course he luuuurves her and so it should really shock them all that much d oh and i really loved the part on the train to hogwarts with sirius thowing the sweets at her and her catching them and then james realising and then when he kissed her hand cheers muchly for the review smay i reckon he ll have a few more parts yet see above ljstagflower4e ya i mean like they totally werentright for each other and like have did you see the state of him in this chapter i dontthink so d angelinaweasley1 thanks so much for you review lily never been depicted like this i sure she has somewhere anne janet thanks love yeah hang your coat up behind the door milk sugar shortywithbrains i luff all my reviewers i luff them because they cheer me up whenever i having a bad day let me let you in on a little secret on my stats

d the killers were amazing i totally serious go and buy their album they have a kind of indie rock thing going on and i luff them almosy as much as the libertines which is really saying something since i would gladly through myself off a bridge if the libertines would make another album and pete and carl would get back together sigh anyway listen to the killers because they are great so great in fact that i bought a t shirt even at the extortionate price of 18 flame of desire thanks dude i ll update asap vickiicky i sure your fics arentcrap and i would check them out if i had any bloody free time i dontknow about deleting fics i used to want to delete my uber crap first fic but then i discovered looking back on it was kinda fun like i think at least i dontwrite like that any more so just keep going if you enjoy it hm i dontthink you d quite fit into the scheme of things but maybe i ll write you a little paragraph here to make up for it victoria pomeroy who was blonde blue eyed and according to her a total weirdo had just flown from the library where she had just heard a whispered conversation between some fourth year and that guy in her house who always put sugar in his pumpkin juice at breakfast what this conversation comprised of was essentially that amos diggory had dumped lily evans without any valid reason and was now the victim of a marauders joke for all his efforts driven by an overly developed sense of justice or maybe just a plain hero complex victoria hurried through the corridors trying to find someone she knew so that she could talk to someone about this groundbreaking school scandal turning a corner near the hufflepuff common roon she came across an odd vision there was the object of the gossip himself dripping in some manner of green gunge and trying in vain to rid himself of the filthy substance victoria ambled over trying not to laugh at her approach he looked up with a thunderous glare what are you looking at he demanded victoria smirked as if the answer wasntobvious then she decided to drop her school bag on the carpet beside her pull back her fist and knock that sulky glower straight off his face there was a nice echoing smack sound as her knuckles connected with his cheekbone and when diggory was suitably sprawled on the floor victoria leaned ominously over him and delivered the following speech i d better watch it if i were you mate in case you didntknow lily evans has friends and now she has considerably more than you picking up her school bag the blonde hopped over the floored boy and continued on her way some way down the corridor she looked at her victorious hand which was rather unattractively covered in slime ew have fun she devil dontwe all honey foxyie xox do you thank you very much i think james is going to have redeem himself pretty quickly i sure they ll be more slip ups to come frighteninglyobsessed it not getting worse weh hey only secret dontwe all there a queue here you know d tracey hehe thanks dontwear yourself out with all the jumping actually i dontupdate all that often do i nevermind that so totally true girls are a mystery too that probably why they dontunderstand us because even we dontunderstand ourselves and why we dontunderstand them because we hardly understand ourselves it a wonder anyone gets born around here that what i say coursework is the work of the antichrist how it works is i have exams lots and lots and lots of panic inducing nightmare giving piss yourself with fear exams and coursework is work the exams board give you to do during the year so that if you dontget a good mark on your exams it proves you at least know the material enough to write it down out of the timed conditions or it proves that you can go onto those websites that sell pre written coursework illegally but why quibble camillekiss omg dontdie for the love of fluff why are reviewers always threatening to kill themselves siriusforeva indeed it is rejoice good people of fandom waves banner iluvdraco4eva you flatter me too much blushes kiwislushie thanks for your comments on james i like lovable james he funnier than arsehole james snuggles lovable james milky way bar oh yes it really does people pay attention when you write an 81 chaptered fic believe me honey d cat indeed good riddance thanks for the note next chappy the atrocious article aftermath whose fault is it anyway just what is going between remus and verity obviously it has nothing to do with pyjamas cough cough and snape enters fire in the hole nuff said love from your thoughtful and considerate author five great balls of fire bang oh bollocks the afore mentioned phrase was the very first expletive that emerged from the mouth of sirius black when he laid eyes on the first issue of hogwarts hearsay bang i know agreed james sitting on sirius bed with his back against the wall remus looked up at him sympathetically bang you know prongs it not that bad nobody going to believe diggory walked in on you and lily snogging firstly how would he have gotten the password to the heads dorms and secondly it as common knowledge that lily detests you as it is common knowledge that cornelius fudge is going to cause the downfall of wizarding democracy as we know it bang moony sirius said if you re trying to make the poor boy feel better then maybe you should just shut your gob bang nah he right padfoot james said miserably lily does hate me and she wasnttoo thrilled with that skeeter cow reporting either did i tell you that she had just acknowledged that i was sorry for all the crap i d done before she saw that bloody notice and everything went down the drain ouch muttered peter ba the boys looked up from the notice when the door to their dormitory clicked open and verity appeared in the doorway holding her wand alight and wearing nothing but an old oversized wimbourne wasps t shirt sirius rolled his eyes as he watched remus eyes widen and his face go decidedly red even in the fading light obviously the black and yellow stripes set off verity dirty blonde spikes and hawk like eyes quite nicely what the frig is going on in here verity demanded in a sleepy voice what are you lot doing making that great banging some of us girls are trying to get some sodding sleep james stopped banging the back of his head against the wall and smiled sheepishly sorry he muttered i was trying to top myself by way of killing brain cells verity sighed and raised her hand to rub her eyes making the hem of her shirt float a little higher up her legs remus looked as though he would have liked to dive under the covers of his bed and hibernate for the next three years what did you do to lily now she asked in a strained voice wordlessly james handed over the notice verity scanned the article and sighed again if only skeeter played quidditch for ravenclaw she said wistfully then i could nick sirius club give her a good smack round the head and make it look like an accident you and me both sirius agreed poking his tongue out of his mouth and miming rotating his beaters club like her was aiming for a baseball well i d better go see her verity said before she does something she ll regret tomorrow morning like putting bubotuber pus on your toothbrush or something i taking that map thingy she said walking to one of the desks and rifling around in one of the drawers pray i dontget caught will ya as she bumped her hip against the drawer shutting it again remus had opened his trunk and grabbed something from it he blocked her path to the door and held out a pair of his pyjama bottoms to her as she narrowed one of her eyes at him in a questioning look put them on he said voice quite face scarlet while verity looked at him as if he were telling her to go shave her head go on i dontwant you catching cold and if you get caught by filch he trailed off pushing the blue checked cotton towards her a small snort came from the corner remus i not gonna get caught and it eighteen degrees outside verity argued while inside she was really going awwwww please remus said quieter still just put them on for me please verity stared at him for a minute then she tutted shoved her wand and map into his arms so he had to take a step back to stop himself over balancing and snatched the bottoms from his hand remus smiled in relief as she bent down and hopped about for a minute grabbing his arm to steady herself as she tugged the material over her legs then she straightened up snatched her wand and the map back and surveyed remus and james with a deeply pitying look you boys she sighed you re barking mad the lot of you once she had disappeared out the door rounds of hilarious laughter erupted from james sirius and peter as remus gapingly stared after the chaser what didja think of that moony asked peter grinning i think she deserved a werewolf sign of approval dontyou asked james sniggering remus turned and threw himself onto his bed burying his head under the pillow so his friends could barely pick out a muffled sod off aaaaawwwwoooooo howled sirius launching the marauders into a fresh wave of laughter lily i think you re angry at the wrong person here verity said calmly as lily stomped around the hallway of the heads dorms distracting herself by wading through james stuff to find her own she paid as much attention to her friend words as she would have paid attention to petunia during one of her century long phone conversations what is wrong with that boy she only asked in an incredibly irritated tone do i have to curse him into clearing his crap up no i think you should forgive the boy for what he did this morning because he couldnthave know that skeeter the human wireless station was going to spread nasty rumours about you lily stopped stomping and stared at verity not really seeing her but remembering that moment with james in the entrance hall when all her worries had floated away in his embrace well half embrace and she had genuinely pondered whether or not to go to hogsmeade with him next weekend maybe she should forgive him after all he hadntdone anything wrong that she hadntforgiven already that notice wasnthis fault it wouldntchange the fact that she had the same attitude towards him as one male tiger had toward another tiger that was trying to steal its territory but verity was right rita was the one who should need a bullet proof riot shield not james cheer up verity said knowing that lily knew she was right we ve got charms tomorrow morning and professor flitwick will love your little last autumn night vision or whatever it called midsummer night dream lily said distractedly looking around at the mess i think he ll like it too now if only i could bloody well find it if you were chosen as head girl this position was given to you on a number of judgements number one you were hard working number two you were trustworthy number three you were capable and number four you were punctual on that monday morning lily embodied all of the above traits except for the last meaning she had overslept so this was the reason she was bobbing up and down outside the bathroom banging on the door with her fist every so often how was it that she had gotten stuck sharing a bathroom with potter this was punishment for something she must have done in another life like executing her sister as queen elizabeth i or something actually reflecting on this executing her sister didntseem like such a bad prospect she banged on the door again what on earth was he doing in there charming each individual strand of hair to stand on end she was just about the slap the door again when it opened before her palm could make contact and instead it smacked onto the very wet chest of one head boy james paid no attention to the smarting he only grabbed the hand and held it there he was not letting her get away without getting her to forgive him first lily i was hoping to catch you listen i am incredibly sorry about yesterday please donthate me i had no idea it was going to go that far or that anyone would write nasty things about you and i will do anything to make it up to you anything lily lilo are you there what wrong she seemed to have been rendered temporarily speechless james tightened his hold on her fingers he was going to make her say something if he had to stand here dripping all day she only gaped at him like a trout on sedatives lily was not on sedatives but she was very shocked not shocked that james would come out of a bathroom with only a towel round his waist that was just something he d do na ve fool but instead she was shocked at her own feelings he was pressing her fingers to his chest to stop her running away but the way her breathing quickened it seemed like she d just run a mile she could feel the dull pulse of his heart behind his ribs pushing blood around his body and felt what must have been all her own blood rush to her cheeks this was very dangerous w what are you talking about she stammered hurriedly trying to speak at normal speed while tugging at her hand nothing wrong i forgive you really asked james stunned he loosened his squeeze on her hand and it slipped from his skin he felt a little sorry about that yeah really it fine lily said wiping her hand on her folded towel now i have to um you know take a shower ah in her haste to get into the room she d forgotten that the floor was sunken a bit to stop water from the shower leaking out before she went flying james had grabbed her by the torso and arm and steadied her are you sure you re all right lilo i mean first you forgive me no questions asked and then you nearly fall over i fine really fine perfectly lily stuttered and without further ado she darted into the bathroom and shut the door locking it and leaning against it for a moment after a second she released the breath she d been holding and waited until her mind cleared the staggering immobility it had frozen into then she rushed over to the basin and started splashing cold water onto her face chucking her former feelings into a box latching it shut and burying very deep into the soil of her mind fifteen minutes later she was ready for breakfast slinging her bag onto her shoulder and picking her charms project up off the coffee table she left for the great hall as soon as she entered whispers broke out all over the house tables lily spotted copies of hogwarts hearsay dotted around the hall and tried her best to ignore all the attention wanna see my sculpture asked verity as she sat down next to lily and picked the scones out of the basket that looked the most burnt yeah go on then lily said carefully avoiding the sight of the gryffindor seventh year boys verity bent down and hauled something heavy onto the table lily frowned is that the bust of catherine the constipated from the eighth floor shh verity hissed yes it is but dontworry i asked flitwick if i could borrow it really well no but would you look at the masterful crown of ivy round her head i think you did a wonderful job dear catherine said and i d feel beautiful if i didntfeel so ill how can you feel constipated asked lily curiously you donthave a stomach i as confused as you dear come on we d better go verity said shrinking her creation and placing it in her bag lining up outside the charms classroom james felt quite good lily forgave me he cried joyfully to the rest of the marauders have you still got all your teeth asked peter everything still the right colour asked remus how many limbs did you lose demanded sirius i fine james said this is in fact what she said and she forgave me she cursed him remus whispered and made him go completely crackers as far as i concerned you ve all been crackers for as long as i remember james spun round to be faced with the great big nose of serverus snape official grease ball of hogwarts and all around evil git no you are not concerned snivellus james said coldly besides you have the same memory span as a goldfish you wouldntreally remember much dontget hostile with me potter snape smiled craftily because i can easily get you black and the big bad wolf thrown out of here faster than you can draw you your wand james eyes narrowed wanna bet he asked dangerously hand straying to his pocket snape eyes widened and he abruptly turned round to stalk off but found his path blocked by lily and verity who had just arrived to wait for the professor well hello there snivellus verity greeted him sweetly still aiding the muggle world in its time of oil crisis i see she said eyeing snape hair in a rather disgusted way oh it the mudblood sniffed snape lily had just opened her mouth to retort when she found snape shiny face being dragged away from her james had indeed gotten his wand out and picked snape up with it by the hair with his wand invisibly tugging at snape lank strands james turned him round to face him and held his arm up so snape had to stand on tiptoes to stop his hair being ripped out by the roots say that to her again so i can force that disgusting mouth of yours open and rip your filthy tongue out he hissed perilously panicked snape grabbed around inside his robes for his own wand an action that only lily noticed potter stop she cried rushing forward with her shoe box in her hands but it was too late snape had pulled out his wand aimed madly and shouted ignitio fortunately the tennis ball sized flames missed james and shot towards the stone wall where it rebounded and flew straight back into the corridor lily shouted james dropping snape onto the floor and rushing forward he swept his arm around her waist and pulled her back so that when the fireball reached them it hit not lily head as it would have but the carefully crafted shoebox in her hands she let out a faint yell dropping the box and leaning into the head boy with her arms curled into her chest there she watched her project turn blacker and blacker being consumed in flames and curling into ashes she breathed hard from shock in james arms all her hard work ruined all she wanted to do was curl up into the head boy chest and have a little sniffle but next second james had gripped his wand let go of lily shoulders and cried mobilicorpus snape was pulled towards them through the crowd that had gathered at the sound of fighting before he could say anything however snape spoke with a twinkle of malice in his eye so is it true he asked what are you talking about you mentally mutilated psycho demanded james i dontthink you re in any position to make accusations either because i ll be taking twenty points from slytherin for your little fire flinging stunt that evans has relived herself of one hufflepuff boyfriend not that i care of course but it would be nice to confirm why the whole school is placing bets as to how long it will be before the slut gets herself a new one most of the people gathered cringed that was going to cost him it was a well known fact that james was usually an extremely laid back boy cracking jokes and making people laugh was what he did best and because he was one of the most intelligent students in the school he didnthave to worry about schoolwork when he felt the slightest inclination to try his hand at some he didntworry about getting into trouble because they wouldntexpel someone of such high talent and he didntworry about anything social because he had three of the very best friends in the world however there were a few points that were a tad touchy to him so if you wanted to piss james potter off apart from making sure you had a suicide note beside you you could do one of the following things express the opinion that werewolves are traitorous murderers casually remark that all gryffindors are good for nothing turds throw a punch at either remus lupin peter pettigrew or sirius black ponder out loud why people played quidditch when it seemed like such a pointless waste of time and finally one that should bring a black haired hazel eyed armageddon your way insult lily evans the head girl in question sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose wouldntprofessor flitwick just stroll into the corridor and save her now james face was going uncharacteristically red verity started to fear for snape life lily tutted this had gone far enough potter put snape down now she said sharply james whirled round bringing snape with him he directed snape right up close to lily making her take a step back apologise to the head girl he shouted lily pulled out her own wand by now snape looked positively worried potter if you dontput snape down right now please do as miss evans says mr potter or i shall be taking points off the students turned to see professor flitwick pattering along the corridor with his satchel wade through the crowd pardon me mind yourself excuse me and unlock the classroom it was barely two feet from snape feet to the floor but james sour faced made a point of just plopping him onto the slabs as if he were letting go of someone else smelly sock snape glowered as his legs crumpled beneath him and stalked off to find his classroom lily hurried into the room after flitwick wondering how she was going to explain to him what had happened to her homework i very sorry professor but i donthave my homework today because a slytherin set fire to it in her ponderings she didntnotice when james grabbed hold of verity and steered her into his usual seat between sirius and remus slipping into the seat beside lily himself lily turned to speak to verity and jumped when she was faced with james instead hello he whispered as people around them settled down lily scanned round desperately for another seat but there were none left oh no she did not want to speak to james right now if she did she thought that her wand would probably do most of the talking lily set her jaw determinedly james sighed he was going to have to explain something to her but how was he going to do it when she wouldnteven engage in communication with him mime it he automatically pulled out quill ink and a sheet of parchment and suddenly he had an idea maybe it was a little old school but those who owed big apologies could not be choosy as professor flitwick introduced the new charm they would be tackling today he started to scribble when he had finished he pushed the sheet towards lily who promptly ignored it completely lily i want to apologise for just now it was a really stupid thing to do and it didnthelp anything i realise now that you would have handled it a lot better scribble back he could see with a slight twinge of satisfaction that she was itching to read it it is a fact of life that notes passed in class are irresistible to read both when they are addressed to you and even more when they aren t finally she snatched it up and slipped it into her text book to read then she picked up her quill and scribbled below james note as he awaited it eagerly potter of course i would have handled it better for one i would have simply ignored him haventyou learnt by now that people like snape are simply not worth anyone time i dontlisten to anything he has to say and neither should you stop passing notes in class and start taking them james sighed and tried to explain lily i really sorry i just couldnthelp it you know i like you a lot so much in fact that when anyone tries to hurt you or calls you names i dunno it just gets to me like when that igniting charm was flying your way first i wanted to be sure that there was no way you would be hurt next i wanted to curse snivellus brains out you may not believe it but it completely true it like a tick an instinct i ve never taken a single note in my life and i dontintend to start now lily picked up the sheet of parchment straight away this time and as she read it though her expression got softer and softer until it reached a kind of pitying annoyance like the expression with which one might a regard a fly which is just about to meet a fly swatter you are such a stupid idiot sometimes but i suppose it ok by the way i still taking points off james grinned i know i a stupid idiot and it all your fault damn i was hoping you d forget about those the rest of the lesson they passed in silence well written silence except for a single thank you that was uttered by way of the parchment when the head boy interrupted his neighbour to explain why she didnthave her homework it lying in a pile of ashes in the corridor outside will you be taking house points off sni snape professor or shall i and that concludes our meeting for today lily finished standing before the prefects of each house while james lounged in a chair beside her with his ankles crossed on the table in front of him they were assembled in an empty classroom for a prefect meeting and while lily had been speaking for a little under an hour the only things that had been coming out of james mouth were the bubbles he blew in his drooble best blowing gum i sorry today meeting has been such a long one lily said trying to ignore the filthy bottoms of the head boy shoes that were dangerously close to her parchments copies of the duties lists and the rounds timetables she had just managed to fill in but as you can see we have everything sorted out now so there shouldntbe another meeting of this length unless things go considerably less than smoothly she shot james a warning look telling him if things did indeed fail to go smoothly she would be blaming him any questions she asked there was a huge rustle and almost every person in the room raised a hand oh said lily a little shocked had she really explained things that badly the first person interrupted james speaking for the first time who utters anything remotely connected to amos diggory loses both their badge and their dignity at breakfast tomorrow there was no doubt this threat meant one of the head boy famed practical jokes and the forest of hands met a rather absolute bout of deforestation brilliant he said removing his shoes from the table oh and would the gryffindor prefects pass on a message to anyone concerned in your year that quidditch practice starts wednesdays fridays and saturdays next week details on the notice board see you all then next week thought lily queasily her stomach squirming with nerves she was in fact so distressed at this news that she didntsnap once at james all the way back to the heads dorms not even when he asked her if she would allow him to buy her a butterbeer in hogsmeade that weekend a n who is michael as in come and dance with me michael he so incredibly buff in that video i hear he the actual michael who the song was written about ok that it i cantdie without knowing that guy name if i were to be hit by a bus tomorrow

fanfiction with real life how out there and you re perfectly right lily is having some sort of inner struggle as to what it is however i cantnecessarily say sorry d mulan is one of my favourite disney movies ever in fact it comes right after beauty and the beast yes i often miss words out randomly but fortunately this has gone down since i got myself the fabulous beta that is rose blows kiss to rose you should see the amount of mistakes in my chappies before she gets a hold of them i could tell you were in a good mood that day because you said my fic had depth which i assure you it does not are you joking this could be the most un serious fic ever read but thank you all the same for your lovely comments on characters description etc i was very pleased and maybe i ll look up those books you recommended lastly satire what satire d limbo gal yes the story is very light and it intends to stay that way lily in the other fic was a travesty and i very sorry about that next chappy the intricate and complicated structure of the hogwarts quidditch tournament shifts ever so slightly what this means i do not know you had better ask james rita skeeter dares to show her face in public cow james actually catches and convicts a troublemaker shock horror what is the world coming to six police to no 10 urgh thought lily what a hideously exhausting week apart from monday james had dragged her down to the quidditch pitch every single afternoon after lessons and put her through various drills that she would have refused to do under any other circumstances the present ones incorporating her thirst to carry out that well known song lyric anything you can do i can do better unfortunately the things james could do turned out to be quite difficult and he had been doing them for a lot longer too so at the end of each day when she sank into her pillows lily felt the soundtrack to her life was now the aptly named song it been a hard day night now on a friday evening she was lying on one of the sofas in the hallway of the heads dorm in her pyjamas with the book she had been reading making a tent over her face how she would love to just drop off here and now the only thing that did any dropping off was her book though because at that moment the door banged open and the head boy strode in looking as stressed as lily was tired as an expert guide to decorative charms toppled onto the floor james took the stairs to his dorm three at a time and ran the fingers of both his hands through his hair the problem with being messy by nature was that you were also often losing important things by nature aha now he remembered he riffled about in one of the drawers of his desk and found what he was looking for but there was no space to work here he grabbed some ink and a quill and darted down the stairs again frowning as he slid onto his knees and slapped the parchment he d located onto the coffee table who poured potion in your pumpkin juice asked lily sleepily and james only just noticed she was there instantly his mood lifted and he smiled faintly it nothing he said you look tired take a nap dontyou shrug me off potter she said indignantly i asked what the matter was and i want to know what the matter is if i remember correctly you asked who poured potion in my pumpkin juice james grinned teasing and i fairly certain when i say that no one ever gets into my pumpkin juice why do you want to know anyway you look like you would rather be tucked up in bed with a hot water bottle he looked down at his parchment and frowned again so he didntnotice that he had caught her off guard indeed lily was asking herself why she wanted to know it couldntbe because she was looking for a way to help him to take that aberrant frown off his face where a lopsided grin rightly belonged no she was just curious that would be it i just do ok she argued because when that usual cocky grin has left your face then i know something serious must have happened possibly the assassination of the prime minister james chuckled if i tell you will you promise to go upstairs and lie down if it means that much to you answered lily in a voice that clearly said she thought him a bit strange it does james said honestly not looking up again he had caught her off guard if they had been in a duel she would have been looking around for a competent second by now so what got you all riled up then she asked distracting herself from the sickly sweet feeling in her stomach by reaching down to pick up her book snape been to the hospital wing complaining of a twinge in his knee apparently from when i dropped him onto the floor on monday how would that not make you happy asked lily confused he convinced madam pomfrey to give him enough reason to miss his first quidditch match next month against us so now i have to change our entire training programme to fit the hufflepuffs instead they have a completely different style of playing lily frowned it was such a strange sight to behold james tall form bent over a piece of parchment brow knit slightly as he drew the strangest signs and symbols and scribbled little notes around the edges firstly because he just didntseem to fit the job description of writing something his shoulders were too broad his limbs were too long and his eyes were too playful to be hooded on work secondly because this was james potter who never actually concentrated for more than an average of six seconds on anything maybe lily eyes were playing tricks on her and the image of james potter working was merely an illusion maybe she was more exhausted than she thought as he scribbled she pulled the rest of his pile of work towards her and rolled over onto her back again examining the pages full of his tall spidery handwriting crickey this was confusing the contents of the pages were overflowing with phrases she didntunderstand like porskoff ploy and dopplebeater defence there were also a number of intricate diagrams that would have probably taken lily a whole hour to decipher yet james was putting them together like he was writing fluently in another language she laid the pages back on the coffee table carefully and regarded him for a moment you really do know what you re talking about dontyou she said james smiled and looked up from his parchment it may come as a shock and i dontexpect you to believe this but i do have the capacity to work hard i just never do it in lessons a grin appeared on his face but it was short lived what are you still doing down here he demanded what asked lily i told you to go upstairs and go to sleep he said with a wonderfully authoritative tone oh lily sighed distractedly she raised a hand to rub her eyes and let out a small scream when she found herself being lifted clean off the sofa potter she squealed outraged put me down this instant james ignored her and ferried her across the hall struggling to keep a hold of her knees and back stop squirming he told her in the same tone and pulled her body closer to him lily gave up she was too tired thank merlin they had reached the door to her staircase he was going to put her down now what the password he asked her oh no just put me down now she resisted i can walk you know not until you say the password he said not budging lily could only be grateful that nobody was in the same room to see this she d never live it down pruning petunias she muttered sullenly and to her horror not only did he not put her down but he carried her all the way up the stairs and into her dorm well maybe not completely to her horror because she did want to sleep and she had been dreading climbing those stairs but still james placed her carefully on the duvet and jumped backwards when she made a grab at his neck now now he told her waggling a finger at her teasingly it for your own good young lady now go to sleep and dontwake up until late tomorrow in time to ferry the little people over to hogsmeade with me all right lily only glowered in response nighty night he bade her and disappeared through the door much too late lily had the idea of throwing something at him but she probably would have been too sleepy to aim properly anyway and she couldntbe arsed to get off her warm bed next morning lily put it down to being impossibly tired but at the moment when she snuggled down under the covers and closed her eyes the thought struck her that it had been quite nice being ordered about by james maybe it was because she was used to having to be in charge herself but that authoritative tone that james had only dared to use because she was wandless and tired had made her feel cared for the stress was taking its toll on her she thought the next morning she was going nuts thanks i needed that lily said to verity as she put her bottle of butterbeer back down on the table after taking the gulp to end all gulps i d hate to see what you d be like with real drinks verity said surveying the half empty or half full bottle then you d better not offer to pay for them grinned lily i ll bear that in mind smiled verity so you nervous then bout what asked lily with a grin ending up a terminal alcoholic and drinking myself into an early grave no bout practices verity said tutting should i be asked lily because i really am well you know verity said tracing the rim of her butterbeer bottle it just girls playing quidditch you dontsee it all that often do ya you ve been playing since you were seven you told me lily argued yeah but i different i a ladette arenti smirked verity all friendly with the chaps and so on i donthave any girl friends apart from you of course and i play quidditch you on the other hand are undeniably a girly girl arentya i just saying dontbe surprised if you get any trouble from people that all besides i reckon half the school thinks i a boy and the other half reckons i romantically confused so there you go little do they know that verity hooch only plays quidditch because all the good looking guys do whispered lily propelling both her and verity into hysterical giggles hello muttered verity after she had pulled herself together speak of the devils lily turned to the doorway of the pub and spotted two heads of black hair one of light brown and one of blonde oh bollocks she muttered as verity stood up clutching her butterbeer and waved for all she was worth oi lads she hollered really it was no wonder half the school thought her best friend was a boy mused lily with a voice like that she could commentate for games without a microphone are you gonna come and buy us a couple of rounds or what james eyes lit up when he saw a redhead beside verity as if he d just been presented with a quaffle and an open goal the boys waded through the pub towards their table and slid into seats trapping the girls between them no escape now lily she thought evening evening ladies grinned james and what would you two lovely creatures be doing in a pub of all places demanded sirius grinning it just aintrespectable you know especially with the likes of you lot added lily while sirius pretended to be scandalized and clamped his hands to his cheeks there was a clacking sound and the six seventh years looked up too see madam rosemerta tottering over to their table with a notebook and a quill all right kids she said giving them a fuchsia pink smile while lily grinned back that really was the colour to get anyone with a hangover out of your pub in the early morning what it ll it be then why rosemerta exclaimed sirius suddenly ignoring the question i do believe you get prettier every time i see you that probably because you get uglier every time you see your reflection in the drink she hands you muttered james loud enough for everyone to hear rosemerta threw back her head and laughed as if the smoke coming off the warlock pipe at the next table were laughing gas what a pair you two she gasped but i cantstand here chortlin all evening with you got drinks to serve an that what a shame sighed james tilting his head towards lily in feigned disappointment rosemerta arched an eyebrow and glanced from lily to james and back again ere she said suspiciously you two been stepping out at last an not telling me lily eyes widened in horror james made a pf noise i wish he laughed and leaned forward to whisper quite loudly lily here out of my league now that is a shame sighed madam rosemerta while lily let her head fall onto the table with a bang so what ll it be to drink boys three whiskeys a bottle of ogden s five vodkas and a dozen shots of gin they said in turn four butterbeers it is smiled the landlady turning back to the bar oh well two months to go until i eighteen grinned james verity gasped no bloody way lily exclaimed quietly with such a dirty look on her face that a whole bottle of miss skower could not have removed it it all right lilo you dont have to get me a birthday present james assured her then he followed her gaze and said oh it the wand blonde parrot herself remus muttered pray for your lives and reputations added sirius quietly as rita skeeter neared their table lily eyed the ravenclaw scathingly trying to keep her temper under control but it was like trying to hold back a shark that had just caught a whiff of blood in the water rita smiled around the table smugly knowing perfectly well she was as welcome here as a notorious criminal in gringotts hi james she said sweetly goodbye he answered pointedly rita only smiled wider and tossed her hair over her shoulder i wonder if you would do me a favour you see i run this little newsletter called hogwarts hearsay you may have heard of it anyway it would be really good if the next issue had an interview preferably from someone famous and you re the lucky star pardon me asked james in a slightly disgusted voice i would only need about five minutes of your time rita said or more if you feel like it she smirked no i honestly didnthear a word you said james amended because i ve decided that it best not to pay any attention to the stream of utter rubbish that comes out of your mouth so i afraid that there really no point in you being here any longer unless it to apologise for spreading nasty rumours about lily james looked at the ravenclaw expectantly well i dontthink there anything to apologise for rita said innocently looking hurt you see it is called hogwarts hearsay so whatever i hear i write that how it works who did you hear it from then asked verity laying a hand on lily twitching arm i cantreveal my sources rita said as if she were talking to a frog we understand remus told her it never easy admitting you re a schizophrenic now please remove yourself and the voices in your head requested sirius rita lips pursed as if she had just drunk a whole bottle of undiluted lemonade before she turned around and walked towards the doorway of the pub it was wednesday in the changing rooms and james was standing with verity and sirius outside the cubicle lily had been changing in for the last half hour lilo come on called verity you want to be out in time for our first match at least added james grinning the door unlocked and opened there stood lily in a severely over sized set of quidditch robes hem dragging on the floor and sleeves half way down her thighs don t say a word she warned them i think we ought to shrink them james said and lily shot him a look that could have blistered paint her quidditch robes shrunken considerably lily followed the other seventh years out onto the pitch clutching james old sparrow sixteen it sounded silly but she didntfeel stupid now as she did in her huge robes in the changing rooms all that made way for an undercurrent of excitement as james dumped the box of quidditch balls down on the grass and his broomstick on top of it right seven players we re all here are we the team nodded looking eager to get back on the pitch as well as lily james verity and sirius keith barker filled in the other beater position sixth year only just recovered from sixty eight stitches collectively ainsley tall defended the goals as keeper third year told to tie back his dreadlocks every single practice by james and simon kipping added to james and verity as the third chaser sixth year and apparently knew the release date selling statistics and mechanical characteristics of every broomstick currently sold in the world this began james is sirius s verity s lily and my last year here at hogwarts our last and lily only year of playing quidditch lily glanced at sirius and verity asking silently if james was always this morose at the beginning of each season verity shook her head with a puzzled look on her face this is our last chance to win it admittedly we were a bit unlucky the past few years injuries keith grinned as sirius slapped him on the back people taking time off because it looked it they were going to fail their owls i passed didnti smiled simon raising his hands in a shrug and of course those bloody cheating foul playing slytherins finished james bitterly we easily have the best team in this school and the only reason we haventheld up that cup is because some people think it all right to ignore the rules of this beautiful game there was a cheer from the team and lily struggled not to laugh so this year what we re going to do is play like we ve always done and the captain frowned for a moment hope we dontget screwed about i suppose sniggers ran through the team as james coughed and pushed his glasses up his nose then he laughed ok i mucked up that speech but we re going to win this year i can feel it he chuckled as the team laughed and shook their heads oh and one minor note james added our lily here a bit new to the game doesntquite know what she doing as of yet ow james rubbed the back of his head where the sparrow sixteen had connected with it but if any of you or anyone else gives her any stick about it then you re off the team no arguments are we talking about the same lily here asked ainsley i dontthink anyone has dared give lily any stick ever he winked at her making her smile even more of a reason not to grinned james kicking the ball box open right groups of three please one at each end one feeder one attacker one defender count your goals tall if i have to tell you about that hair again i coming after you with a pair of scissors you have to sleep sometime question 1 referring to the attack of asian harpies in 469 bc explain how this event in wizarding history affected the next fifty years both socially and politically 12 marks lily had long decided that there was absolutely nothing funny about newt practice papers they were hard they were impossible without an open textbook and by merlin they were bloody scary sighing she flipped though before you were born three thousand years of history you missed newt edition underlining chunks of text in red ink she was just about to start the first sentence of her answer when a knocking sound echoed through the heads dorms making her quill skid on the parchment tutting lily threw it down onto her desk and stood up going downstairs to the hall no one was supposed to be out of their dorms at this hour and what idiot would be breaking a rule and knocking on the heads door it was probably stupid potter back from his rounds who had forgotten the password amos she exclaimed as the door clicked open hello lily he said and made to enter lily stopped the door opening sorry she said a puzzled expression on her face but what are you doing here i came to talk to you isntit the head girl duty to listen to anyone who wants someone to talk to he asked with a funny smile on his face depends what they want to talk about lily said coldly you have twenty seconds a faintly panicked look crossed his face then it flicked back to that quietly confident and very annoying look as soon as he got into the heads dorm james thought as he neared it he was going to have a long bath and go straight to bed he took his glasses off to rub sleep out of his eyes as he turned the corner into the corridor and frowned as he couldntremember the password what was it again goopy goo he didnthave to worry though the door was already open lily was talking to someone through the doorway james perched his glasses on his nose again so he could see what was diggory doing anywhere near lily james stopped to watch it would be a little awkward if he just strolled up and went in but he promised himself if voices got raised lily diggory began leaning against the door lily on the other hand was beginning to regret leaving her wand in her room you cantdeny that everybody makes mistakes you have to accept that everybody makes mistakes i accept that everybody makes mistakes amos lily answered calmly james closed his eyes as if someone had shone a light bulb in his face and i want to put my mistake right diggory continued that good amos lily said sweetly because i made a mistake too amos looked at her and smiled james leaned against the wall a horrible feeling gripping his stomach giving him the sensation that he was on a submarine with a leak good diggory said yes it is actually lily said because my mistake was ever agreeing to go out with you in the first place what asked diggory as james stuffed a fist in his mouth to stop himself laughing i dontwant to talk to you anymore amos lily said trying to close the door goodnight no wait lily he exclaimed struggling to keep the door open this was enough for james who started to move towards them diggory let go of the door lily said her voice rising not until you admit we belong together diggory shouted and seized lily wrist let me go what do you think you re doing there was a cough and the two of them turned to see james standing beside them in the corridor diggory nostrils flared in anger as james pasted an inquisitive smile on his face isntit always the same with rounds he asked lily in a gossipy tone you trek all the bloody way round the castle without a clue and the rule breaking buggers are always in the last place you look lily breathed out slowly and wouldntlook him in the eye so diggory james continued as if they were at a party and he was just about to start a conversation by asking what the boy did for a living here you are out of your dorm harassing the head girl arentyou lucky i came along let see first i want you to let go of lily diggory sullenly released lily wrist and she drew it back to her stroking it to get blood flowing to her fingers again well done james told diggory now i want you to piss off and know that i ll be taking points off and getting you a detention every night for as long as i can manage james stuck his hands in his pockets as diggory turned slowly and walked back down the corridor lily darted angrily into the room not quite sure who she was angry at but angry anyway james rushed in after her hey wait are you all right he asked her before she reached her staircase lily turned on him her anger bubbling over i was doing fine she shouted clenching her fists so that her newly blood rushed knuckles went white again just fine lily he was hurting you james answered exasperatedly gesturing to her wrist and i donttrust him not to take advantage of he was about to say your size but he opted for your extremely fast metabolism instead lily changed track you are such a hypocrite she told him furiously what right did you have to punish him for sneaking out after hours you ve done it more times than there are trees in the forbidden forest lily calm down james said stepping towards her but she only kept on stepping backwards and james was afraid she was going to trip on something i not pretending i didntbreak a few rules but as least it was only to play a prank or two not to try and force someone i hurt to be my girlfriend again he hadntrealised he had raised his voice but it was louder than it usually was and with james that qualified as shouting maybe it had been the sight of diggory grip blocking the path of blood to those fingers that he believed could catch the snitch the fingers that wrote one hundred and three percent exam papers the fingers that threw momentous curses tucked those auburn ringlets behind those ears the fingers that were now clamped over those lips as those eyes struggled not to cry james mouth opened in quiet horror as he watched her curl up and put a hand over her trembling lip i really sorry she told him i didntmean any of that lily evans never cried lily he said softly rushing forward come on sit down he put a hand on her shoulder and guided her towards a sofa she sat without argument sniffing failing to stop the tears that were falling onto her freckles hey he said sitting down and digging about in his pocket for a handkerchief hey dontcry i am not crying she said in a wobbly voice but she took the hanky and mopped her eyes anyway james breathed a laugh and put his arms around her pulling her into a hug lily couldntremember the last time she had been hugged like that if there had indeed been a time but all of a sudden as she leaned into the cotton of his school shirt and breathed in his smell it seemed like she had nothing to cry about even though she definitely was not crying of course not lilo james answered as he rocked her slowly keep the hanky a n anything you can do i can do better sang by doris day and some other guy whose name i cantremember in the musical annie get your gun it been a hard day night by the beatles and no it just the first verse not the chorus if anything of that like went on rest assured i would have told you i not that cruel firstly this is how my life in general pans out for the

something lady of masbolle fantabulous thank you very much keep reading my luff next chappy it pistols at dawn between two teams and it might not even be those scheduled to play the first game of the season i hope you ve all got your red and gold scarves on for gryffindor first match i expect banners slogans flags and passionate cheering from everybody make sure to get a good seat everyone who anyone will be there basically dontmiss the match even if you re dead seven last will and testament it is the truth universally acknowledged that any event one is dreading must arrive sooner than you think for example project presentations examinations and orthodontist appointments always seem to suck up the time before them like vacuum cleaners similarly anticipated events always crawl towards one at the rate of a drowsy snail for example weekends the end of a school day and christmas seem to deliberately prolong the longing for them to finally happen last practice before the match if you dontactually know how to fly this is your last chance to own up shouted james i a bit shaky on turning sirius grinned raising his hand i dunno how to kick off shouted keith i have to hold the handle with both hands at all times added verity it should be an easy win for those hufflepuffs tomorrow then shouldntit lily turned around to see seven green clad quidditch players leaning on broomsticks and smirking at the gryffindors in a rather unsettling way do you mind asked james indignantly it may be a foreign concept to you lot but we are trying to have a practice here oh dontmind us lily identified the speaker to be one serverus snape we ll just go over there and you can tell us how much space you need for your massive gryffindor egos what are you even doing out of the hospital wing snape asked sirius testily isnta twisted ankle enough to keep bed ridden squealing in agony snape ignored the jab and hooked his eyes on lily instead all the slytherins followed his gaze among them the gaze of darius zabini who was grasping a humming snitch got another girl on the team eh potter he grinned lily felt his eyes linger like a child when passing an ice cream parlour on the street she curled herself into a hunch and dragged the scarlet fabric of her over sized quidditch robe back up onto her shoulder from where it had fallen zabini smirked yes well you dontseem to be having much luck with an all boy team so i thought it would be wise to go the other way james shot back the members of the slytherin team narrowed their eyes and cracked their knuckles well at least i didntput them on the team just because i want to get off with them zabini smirked looking condescendingly at the snitch he was pinching in his fingers james made to reach for his wand but lily put a hand on his arm he froze at her touch no no it ok she said to the slytherin team at least i can still nick the snitch from under your nose eh cant i she challenged swiping the golden ball from the fingers of the slytherin faster than you could blink laughs and catcalls jeered from the gryffindors as ainsley and keith put a protective arm each round their seeker should any slytherin feel they should take back their snitch and while they were at it a handful of lily hair they had no reason to worry however because the slytherins were retreating back to the castle that friday night james sat in the gryffindor common room his brow frowning fingers on his chin hazel eyes intently focused he could either do that or do that but what would his opponent do he hurriedly mapped out some strategies in his head calculating risks and difficulties finally he decided on a course of action checkmate declared remus in satisfaction damn it answered james honestly he was quidditch captain he should have been able win at chess every single time even against a genius like remus maybe he should hire remus to work out quidditch strategies for him apart from the marauders the common room was empty everyone had long gone to bed in order to get up early enough for the match tomorrow quidditch was one of the fastest games in existence and bleary eyed and sleepy fans often missed a goal or two in the process of a single yawn the portrait hole opened silently and james glanced up to see lily creep in in only her nightdress dragging her purple quilt on the floor behind her it really should have worked lily thought her plan to enter the common room without attracting the attention of the four boys it should have gone down as smoothly as a pint of irish beer unfortunately she had forgotten that weird sort of radar that one james potter had in his head i mean come on how else would he know she had just entered she was pretty sure there wasnta third eye in the back of his head and in any case he wouldnthave been able to see with it because his hair was so thick and messy what are you doing up the object of her musings demanded jumping from his seat on the sofa as if he had tried to sit on a kebab stick i couldntsleep muttered lily exactly like the response of a sulky teenager who had been caught sneaking out too nervous james tutted sirius pulled a cringe that was a mistake you re up lily shot at the head boy testily so dontyou tut at me mister i don t follow my own advice but lilo you re my star player james said leaning over and putting his hands on her shoulders everyone else is expandable ouch prongs beaters have feelings too you know sirius interrupted now you ve gone and wounded my emotional and sensitive soul oh shut up you re wounding my soul muttered remus frowning but there is only one of you and you re going catch the snitch for us arentyou you re going to win us one hundred and fifty points arentyou you re going to get the match in the bag for us arentyou say yes he not of stable mind advised sirius i going to see verity lily said warily slightly concerned by james resolve in her position she freed herself from james grasp and hurried up the girls staircase nearly tripping up on her quilt and making james cringe dontget even minutely injured in the next twenty four hours he shouted after her waking up half of the house while he was at it no twists no pulls no bruises no pinches no paper cuts nothing and no talking to hooch lights out straight to sleep oh go get shoved off a broomstick lily shouted back waking the remaining half of the house while she was at it what in the name of cleansweep is going on demanded verity as soon as lily had entered the seventh year girls dorms the other girls harriet wicket and daisy bass were sleepily removing their eye masks and earplugs potter stupid hypocrite was getting up his own arse about me up at this hour when he probably going to be up past midnight fumed lily throwing her quilt onto verity four poster and sitting down on it with a bad tempered thump oh bloody hell muttered harriet wearily replacing her eye mask with a snap of elastic and throwing her head back onto her pillows would you just snog him and get it over with i beg your sodding pardon asked lily in a bit of a shock honestly lilo harriet began to explain would everyone stop calling me that it all that repressed sexual tension it enough to make anyone as loud as a sonorous charm at this hour i have no idea what you are talking about lily said with as much dignity as anyone whose blood flow to the face was probably draining most of it away from the brain could what she means to say daisy amended trying to keep the peace and in turn get a little peace is that if we dontsee you good luck tomorrow thank you daisy lily smiled ta daisy harriet said sarcastically come here verity said to lily drawing the curtains around her bed again as lily crawled towards her friend pillow the girls snuggled down under two quilts arms round each other lily head nestled under verity chin ver lily whispered if i die tomorrow she began but was cut off by verity burst of giggles lily you are not going to die it not funny lily insisted waiting grudgingly for verity hysterical laughter to ebb if i die i want you to make sure potter doesntlet the school sink into complete disorder will you do that whatever helps you sleep at night lilo ouch did you just pinch me or has that family of south american claw tweakers gotten in through the window again and there something else i would like you to do as well but only if i die d you hear fire away verity said patiently i want you to lily began and bit her lip verity rolled her eyes if this was the way things were going to progress they were going to be up until tomorrow match was over i want you to thank potter on my behalf for being tolerable in my presence over the past few weeks verity eyes were just drooping closed when they widened with an almost audible snap ha what she exclaimed loudly shut the frig up harriet slash daisy shouted back only on the condition that i firmly six feet under lily insisted with an urgent tone all right all right lily verity said half giggling they snuggled down again pulling the covers back over their heads and sharing out their mutual warmth lily closed her eyes and felt that her duty was done if she should die in the match tomorrow which lily knew there was a very small chance of happening but still worried her inexplicably then she was safe in the mind that hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry would not be thrown into a state of absolute chaos and anarchy probably and she would be able to show the small amount of gratitude that was due to the head boy and it would be made easier by the fact that she would not be there to see him gloating if she were alive she was sure she would never be able to live it down bloody hell lilo i half hoping you ll die just so i can tell him and see his face ouch i have only one thing to say to you people go beat some badger arse to tell the truth lily was in a bit of a trance as she was herded out of her seat by sirius and verity as the team lined up in pairs just inside the changing rooms lily stood in front of everyone next to james who was peering out onto the pitch and muttering under his breath cloud cover none wind none to speak of sunny firm ground absence of wildlife check lily was temporarily wrenched out of her daze by his last words wildlife she asked incredulously briefly contemplating the possibility that the captain may have lost his mind out of nerves hippogriffs nineteen sixty eight world cup disaster james explained took them ages to re grow the grass after that lily had no time to be scared skinless because remus voice had resounded all around the pitch leaking into the small corridor where the gryffindor team where gathered witches and wizards boys and girls creatures of any other category welcome to hogwarts first quidditch match of the season the sheer volume of the cheer that followed this introduction was massive the banners and cloths that adorned that stands rippled with the huge wave of sound that the crowd produced and lily was sure that absolutely everyone out there was screaming as loud as they possibly could hmm remus said into the microphone the smile evident in his tone is the popularity waning lily heard sirius snort behind her no matter for i shall introduce the hufflepuffs playing today are diggory myers hopkins sapper ferrous dregs and hurst sapper back on the pitch after his ban last year following some very risqu rumours about his dealings in the ravenclaw showers you wouldntthink it to be an intimidating colour but at that moment lily couldntthink of a more terrifying or vicious shade than canary yellow and today their opponents will be the gryffindors a team made up of potter black hooch tall barker kipping and evans the newest addition to the team being evans who was discovered at the last minute by potter after the mad scramble he had to endure at last year try outs watching the teams line up opposite each other was so much more nerve wracking when you were there opposite the opponents rather than watching from the stands mr richards the flying teacher was refereeing one real leg and one wooden leg preparing to kick off from the grass freezing glares were exchanged between the gryffindor and hufflepuff captains as they were required to shake hands lily saw that diggory knuckles emerged from the gesture decidedly whiter than before mount your brooms mr richards requested and everybody on the pitch complied right then lily brain was a complete blank only filled with a strange buzzing sound characteristic of a bad low watt light bulb there the whistle declared remus after the said sound had propelled the crowd into another burst of cheering hufflepuff in possession ferrous grabs the quaffle and makes about twenty yards progress down the pitch dodges a bludger passes to diggory who skirts round kipping and darts towards the gryffindor goals diggory career as a hogwarts hufflepuff chaser is now in it fifth year and the role of captain has been his for two just because remus decided to give the first years some history while nothing drastically interesting was happening on the pitch diggory turned to smile at the crowd and took one hand off the quaffle to wave not for the first time james was thankful for the hufflepuff captain big headedness and took the opportunity to fly straight up to diggory flick the quaffle out from under his arm and fly off in the opposite direction the quaffle is taken by potter putting gryffindor in possession mind that bludger james ducked and heard a whistle pass speedily over his head the hufflepuff chasers had ganged up on him while his head was down quickly he looked around while they closed in and passed to verity who d sneaked up behind him potter passes to hooch who joined the team four years back and is currently flying on the fifth model in the eagle series after discarding her long loyal silver arrow a model rumoured to be facing termination of production anyway hooch nears the hufflepuff goals shoots and scores the first goal of the match goes to gryffindor making the score ten nil the red and or gold banners in the crowd shook with delight as the owners screamed as loud as they could crickey dontspend it all at once remus told them in a bit of a shocked voice it not over yet people the quaffle was back up the end of the pitch near the gryffindor goals after the hufflepuff keeper had chucked it to one of the chasers taught a lesson by his earlier lapse in concentration diggory held onto the quaffle almost religiously making it extremely hard for the gryffindor chasers to tackle him diggory guides the quaffle into the gryffindor scoring area shoots and brings the score up to ten all remus told the pitch the yellow and black banners in the crowd waved with renewed vigour as soon as hufflepuff scored ainsley passed to simon who passed to james who passed to verity who passed back to simon who passed back to james who passed it on to verity this was one of the more uncommon tactics used by players simultaneously every hufflepuff chaser rushed towards simon trying to be the one to intercept to quaffle the crowd wasntreally surprised when the quaffle was passed to james instead who subsequently had a clear shot at the hufflepuff goals twenty ten announced remus into the microphone gryffindor in the lead by one hoop hufflepuff will have to come up with something post haste if they want to even it out or tip the scale in their favour hopkins in possession whoa just missed a bludger smacked his way by barker hopkins drops the quaffle straight into potter hands it was too close the hufflepuff goals for comfort gryffindor up thirty ten ten minutes later the score was forty twenty to the gryffindors lily was flying high above the game not really doing anything other than being scared witless she bit her lip taking a bit of a break from looking for the snitch by looking at james playing james looked like he was comfortable on the pitch james looked like he belonged on the pitch james looked like he was born on the pitch for merlin sake she must look like she would rather have just been sucked through the door of one of gringotts top security vaults she imagined hooch makes her way back up the pitch from the gryffindor goals watch out for that bludger nope nicely saved by black smacking that bludger straight towards breath hissed in through lily teeth as she watched the wheeling black ball zip off and hit mr richard leg for an instant it was not clear to the audience which leg it had hit then it became apparent that it was the wooden one because a loud crack was heard through the pitch and a large chunk of wood went spinning off over the stands in an explosion of splinters leaving only a jagged stump hanging on one side of the flying teacher broomstick that was a 1936 vintage nimbus 100 the lamed man bellowed at sirius his face growing steadily purpler by the second sirius held up a palm in a mild apology sorry he hollered over the appreciative roar of the crowd it may just have seemed that way to james but he got the distinct feeling that things werentas willing to go the gryffindors way after mr richards had sent a startled first year to retrieve his leg from where it had landed of the fringes of the forbidden forest there was a timeout while he established with madam pomfrey that she could not reaffix the baseball bat like piece of wood bone tissue nerve and skin i can deal with mr richards this job requires a carpenter she dismissed irritably when he persisted in pleading with her before the gryffindors knew what was happening it seemed fouls were given to the hufflepuffs for the most trivial things such as simon waving to his girlfriend in the crowd or james being close enough to lily to be able to tip the end of her broom down because she was about to be hit by a bludger soon the score went from a comforting forty twenty to a distressing ninety fifty to the hufflepuffs james was beginning to worry this was a quidditch player worst nightmare you could do nothing to combat a biased referee and arguing would probably make it a lot worse he hardly blamed mr richards for being slightly pissed off about losing a valuable classic broomstick but who in their right mind would have their synthetic leg made out of such a valuable wood then go flying around refereeing quidditch matches with it as he had been doing at intervals throughout the match he cast an eye around for lily just to make sure she was all right oh merlin to make matters worse it looked as if lily had frozen stiff either that or she just wasntmoving james panicked not being able to fathom what could be wrong she was staring at a little point someplace in the distance and james quickly flew over to her lilo lil are you all right what wrong sh she hissed angrily out of the side of her mouth james followed her line of vision and saw she was looking avidly at the hufflepuff seeker what in the name of zonko are you doing staring at hurst asked james a little anxiously isnthe dreamy lily hissed a cruel smile tugging at the edge of he lips what demanded james i joking you pillock i not staring at him i waiting what for asked james baffled and a little relieved i waiting for you to go and do your job and leave me to do mine lily hissed furiously still refusing to look at him james was just about to take her advice when he glanced back at the hufflepuff seeker who had spotted lily and her ardent attention and was looking a little disturbed by it hurst started to fly forward to escape lily piercing stare and that was when james saw it the golden snitch it had been hovering just behind the hufflepuff head and as soon as hurst had moved an eighth of an inch lily had shot forward at an alarming speed consider if you will what it must be like to have a five foot three and a half redhead on a broomstick come speeding towards you at eighty miles an hour it was hardly surprising that hurst did twice that speed in the opposite direction or course he was also doing twice that speed away from the snitch who do you think won the game you know mate sirius slung an arm around james shoulder and breathed something that smelled strongly of ogden in his ear you may be head boy out of our dorm all responsible and all that bollocks but i believe this is the best party we have ever had within the walls of the gryffindor common room james sniggered at the sight of his best friend who was a little under the border of the term completely plastered i think you re right padfoot james agreed noticing his friend had gone a bit purple in the face here are you all right i think you need to sit down nah i fine what are you talking about sirius asked incredulously having the odd sensation that his feet were made out of strawberry jelly i dontneed to sit james watched as his friend spotted a pretty sixth year girl sitting on the edge of her circle of friends with an empty arm chair beside her sirius paused actually to tell you the truth i do feel a bit squiffy once he had deposited sirius in the afore mentioned armchair james continued his former search for his star player casting around for the shock of dark red he spotted lily making her way towards the portrait hole oi lily lilo wait she turned to see him battling his way through his fellow gryffindors all of whom seemed intent on either shaking his hand patting him on the back or challenging him to a butterbeer drinking contest she opened the portrait hole and stepped out and james was struck by how much of an improvement this was usually she d be just starting to run finally he reached the portrait hole and scrambled through damn entrance was just too undignified for anybody over five foot eleven yes what is it she asked a strange superior smile on her face er i just wanted to say well done james said following when she started down the corridor where are you off to there a party just in the next room if you hadntnoticed he teased grinning i have to get up early tomorrow early meeting with madam pince she explained what an unnerving conversation thought james lily was talking to him as though she were talking to verity a few moments later he decided it was very nice she still had an odd happy smile on her face well i i tired as well so james began potter it half past nine it sunday tomorrow and there a party just in the next room if you hadntnoticed lily replied incredulously yes but well i want to walk back with you he admitted good naturedly so you ll just have to put up with me for the next ten minutes he smiled checking his watch not many boys lily knew would admit something like that james seemed to be a lot more lenient with his dignity these days probably because you often have a go at shooting it to pieces lily told herself smiling ruefully merlin lilo when i say something like that i hardly expect you to smile he laughed you didntthink i could do it did you she challenged smugly stopping in the corridor they were currently walking down do what lil smile well at one point during fifth year i really did wonder no catch the snitch you twit she corrected giving him a light smack on the arm you didntthink i could do it that why you got all worried the moment i looked as though i was about to loose it james stared at her for a moment lily stared straight back smiling smugly then james made only a short tisk noise and carried on down the corridor lily smile vanished and she started after him baffled at the sight of a smile now in place on the head boy lips well she demanded not up to your usual logical standard lilo james told her sticking his hands in his pockets whot she said very unladylike if i didntthink you could do it why would i put you on the team unlike zabini so elegantly put it it is not just because i want to get off with you it because you really can do it and you proved it this very afternoon lily gaped and didnteven notice when they arrived in front if the heads dorms after you james said after reeling off the password and opening the door lily wasntshowing any inclination to actually move so james gently pushed her through the door across the hall and positioned her in front of the door to her staircase what i wanted to say back there was that you did a very good job james told her earnestly i suppose it hard to believe i think that because i also give you daily proof that i like you very much indeed lily stared at the wood of her door trying to figure out what it was in his voice but i suppose you ll just have to trust me on that one he said maybe a little apologetically good night lily he said and leaned down to peck her on the cheek next second he had disappeared back through the entrance and lily like a sleepwalker had entered her own room with a jolt so it turned out that he didntthink her completely incompetent in the field of quidditch after all he obviously doesntlike you enough to endanger his quidditch team she thought decidedly and completely wrongly for reader purposes however he had kissed her she realised and had the urge to curse him for touching her oh well she thought un strapping her arm pads she d do it tomorrow a n thank you to everyone who wished me luck for my exams apparently it worked because the chemistry exam the one i was dreading wasntactually

officially over but not in my story hell in fandom it christmas every day james gets out his binoculars and does some stalking lily gets out her minions and does some avoiding the lake is frozen what do we do push people on it of course eight avoiding stalkers it seemed that as head girl your duties and authority were abruptly deemed void as of seven in the morning on the last day before the christmas holidays on her way to breakfast with verity that morning lily had to stick out an arm to stop her friend from walking into a snowdrift that had randomly appeared in the second floor corridor courtesy of some hufflepuff third years mind yourself lily warned as another less lucky prefect slipped and went flying verity pulled a pained face craning to peer behind herself ouch she commented you all right lily yesterday you d be hunting down the poor sods that did this and exercising extreme punishment what gotten into you nothing gotten into me veri lily replied casually stepping over the snowdrift and continuing down the corridor it christmas and i simply cannot be arsed verity regarded her for a moment before shrugging fair enough she said and pushed open the doors to the great hall the scene that they were met with was an extremely strange one the entire population of hogwarts seemed to be turned around in their chairs watching something that something turned out to be the marauders which didntsurprise lily in the slightest they were all standing on the gryffindor table all in santa hats and sirius holding a lantern remus was holding up his wand and charming red and gold sparkly words above them the vast majority of the hall were in hysterics most of the teachers were regarding the scene with either cool detachment or badly hidden amusement what the lily only had time to utter before james shouted from the table all together for the last verse and the entire hall began to sing on the twelfth day of christmas i got confiscated from me twelve cheatfast quills eleven juggling rats ten exploding ink bottles nine shaving hats eight loaded dice seven wet start fireworks six screaming yoyos by this time lily mouth was half hanging open half curled into a smile she laughed outright as every student in the hall took a united deep breath and belted out the next line for all it was worth five live gnomes four sugar quills three dungbombs two purple toads james who had been nodding his head for the duration of the song now raised his arms and began to conduct the last line with great sweeps for every grand finalistic syllable and a si i ix pack of ogden whi i i iske e ey at the last note the hall burst into applause and cheering some of the students mostly gryffindors giving standing ovations as the marauders gave multiple bows and began to step down from their briefly used stage thank you hogwarts you ve been marvellous james saluted the crowd before hopping off after peter after discarding his hat and sitting down at his unofficial place james cleared his throat and now for some breakfast i agree sirius said slapping the table pass the eggs prongs prongs sirius was beginning to worry that his best friend face had gone a little whiter than it usually was he then realised the reason was that one head girl had sat down next to him straight across from james lilo exclaimed james hastily i suppose you ll be wanting an explanation er see the thing is it christmas lily said cutting him off so i will not be disembowelling you james picked up a napkin from the table and pretended to mop his brow well that a relief he said yes i see how that would defeat the whole season of goodwill mood which you seem to be contributing to without a problem lily commented dipping her knife into the marmalade well i heard musicians always get the girl so i thought why not give it try james verity warned him dontpush it so er where are we all going this christmas sirius asked recognising the infamous battle look beginning to creep into lily eyes columbia peter said you lucky bugger sirius said poking peter with a fork spain verity told him ooo very nice james said i ll say sirius added ice cream dancing tapas he leaned in with a conspiring smirk spanish quidditch players he said making remus go very faintly red you going home lilo james asked before spooning yoghurt into his mouth lily remembered a time all too well when he had absolutely no problem talking through whatever food happened to be in his mouth unfortunately her mother had not let her burn the ketchup stains off her school shirt fortunately he now seemed to have gotten some halfway decent manners five years ago for instance he had those of a fish stop calling me that lily growled and no i am not going home not with the newlyweds still anywhere near there there isntalways a bucket handy i staying at hogwarts thanks well my family going to australia james said he smirked when he heard something come out of lily that sounded a lot like thank merlin but i staying here whot cried lily accidentally knocking over a glass of pumpkin juice james pulled his wand out and took care of the mess before replying i said i staying here last year at hogwarts dontwant to miss anything lily turned her horrified face to sirius and remus and you two she asked dread etched on her face same remus said amused i m a gonna say a sirius said in an italian accent same oh holy hippogriffs lily muttered eye wide as verity sniggered into her sugared cereal come on lilo james said it ll be fab we ll fix you up with a santa hat and you can even out our numbers for a snowball fight i d rather run all the way down to brighton lily replied really i ll go with you james said smiling or maybe i ll make it the cliffs of dover so i can throw myself off one of them lily said really i ll jump with you james said smiling lily forehead made a nasty bang sound as it connected with the table oh magic muffins will i never be rid of this pillock i m a gonna say a sirius said no for the run up week to christmas lily had managed to stay reasonably out of the three marauders way with a little help from the house elves and the remaining students at hogwarts a lot of them owed her a favour were secretly wishing for a date or were susceptible to blackmail so what she had asked most of them to do was to walk ten paces in front of her whenever she felt brave enough to venture out of her dorm and warn her whenever james was within a thirty metre radius then she would scurry back to the safety of her room and pretend she wasntthere even though james had an extraordinary way of knowing exactly where she was at any given moment even without that funny old piece of parchment although of course lily didntknow exactly what it did one such time when she had to make a break for it back up her staircase was on christmas day lily had heard that the christmas dinner at hogwarts was enough to make you drool a volume of liquid that would fill the pacific and she was looking forward to it immensely she had also heard that everyone sat at the same table because there were so few people maybe she would be able to get a seat as far away as possible from potter so on christmas day she slept in late and skipped down her staircase at around ten minutes to four in the afternoon just in time for the late lunch as she had been doing for the past week she whipped out her wand and drew a circle of transparency only detectable to her in the door that led from her staircase to the heads common room her heart sank potter was sitting in the common room sprawled out on one of the purple sofas long limbs everywhere reading something on a piece of parchment lily slid down the wall bringing the see through circle down with her he d probably move to go down to lunch soon she d wait until then to go down after him and with any luck he d already be seated so she could avoid sitting next to him good goblins lily thought she d gladly don armed forces camouflage attire paint her face green and complete a military stealth course if it meant she d be able to avoid him unbeknownst to her james knew exactly where she was because the parchment in his hand was none other than the marauders map he sighed because he knew she was avoiding him well she had to come out sometime or else she d starve to death and james didntthink she d go that far just to stay out of his way it was a standoff he discarded the parchment on the coffee table stretched leisurely before putting his hands behind his head and preparing for a wait lily sighed her head was leaning against the stones her eyes looking out of the circular window at the reclined form of the head boy just outside the door thank merlin she had changed the password from pruning petunias to dursley is a dipstick he ll go soon she thought to herself he cantstay out there for ever but he didntget up he simply sat there glancing at the door she was sat behind every once in while and lily had the strangest feeling he knew exactly where she was she knew he was looking because every once in a while she would get a flash of hazel on the background of his pale face he ll get up before i count to a hundred she thought definitely he really was very good looking the light was coming through the high window in the heads common room and showing her the handsome angles of his face when she thought about it it was hardly surprising that almost the entire female and some of the male population of hogwarts fainted when he smiled in their general direction if he actually expressed a genuine interest in anyone other than herself she thought then she suspected madam pomfrey might have a lot of comatose students on her hands he ll go before i count to five hundred she thought why was he even waiting for her this long she asked herself not just outside her door at that moment but generally she knew of ants less determined to get at her mother picnic baskets than james was to get her to go out with him maybe it was a pride thing he probably thought he would look a right fool if he gave up without getting what he wanted it would certainly be fitting to his character she thought backwards he ll go before i count backwards from five hundred if he werentsuch a prick she thought she may have actually considered going out with him because if he werenta prick he d be nice and as well as being nice he d be funny talented athletic and good looking who wouldntwant to go out with someone like that too bad he was a prick then she thought it was like in thirty mark exam essays if you didntget the basic points down but you wrote down all the detail nevertheless then you still didntget any marks at all the professors warned them about that every single year james was funny talented athletic and good looking but because he was a prick he simply didntget any marks lily checked her watch nine o clock she d been sat there daydreaming and staring at james potter for over five hours in french she sighed to herself he will get up and go down to dinner before i count from a thousand backwards in french but she had only just gotten through the neuf cent s and down to hiut cent cinquante six when she fell asleep james woke up slowly when he heard a creaking of the floorboards beneath the purple rug on the floor silently he readjusted his glasses from where they had been tipped askew in his sleep and spotted the head girl trying to make her way stealthily past the sofa he was sprawled on aha he muttered sleepily shifting and trying to collect his wits lily froze bugger she d woken up around ten minutes ago with absolutely no feeling in her legs whatsoever and absolutely too much empty space in her stomach and seen with delight that the wanker was asleep damn potter and his bizarre lily seeking radar damn and blast them she released a frustrated sigh and turned to towards the boy on the sofa struggling to arrange his limbs into some position that would enable him to stand up what do you want she asked irritably aha james said again clearly half asleep but waking up fast why are you stalking me lily demanded waving her hands around near her shoulders james managed to stand up at last i not stalking you lilo he said calmly excuse me lily said furiously you sat outside my room for over five hours and then fell asleep instead of going downstairs to eat like a normal person if those activities dontqualify as stalking i dontknow what does well yes fine james admitted with a smile i may have temporarily taken on some vague stalker like tendencies but you can hardly blame me lilo au contraire lily said because counting in french had taken its toll on her sleep and food starved mind i can blame you entirely mr potter and i am fully intending to do so well you ve been avoiding me james replied fairly i have not been avoiding you lily lied excuse me james imitated we are in the same house we are head girl and boy we live in the same dorm and yet i haventseen you for an entire week if those activities dontqualify as avoiding me i dontknow what does you are infuriating beyond belief lily accused him only because you dontlike me james said and why donti like you lily asked rhetorically because you are infuriating beyond belief james smiled only infuriating lily further i sense a vicious circle coming on he said breezily oh look it snowing he jogged past her and reached the wooden staircase to the bookcase balcony and started climbing towards the large window that showed flakes of snowfall hurrying past the glass what lily demanded stomping after him it snowing james repeated you know the floaty white stuff that comes from the sky looks a bit like david maple dandruff lily mouth twitched upwards for a split second and she released a single breath of laughter as the two of them arrived at the window then she tried to make it look like a moody laugh by going so in a cynical voice so let go outside james said excitedly his hands spreading condensation on the glass as he peered out into the grounds no lily refused why not he said smiling because i hungry it freezing she trailed off for a moment and i hate you if you re hungry we could pay a visit to the kitchens james offered no lily refused just for the sake of being difficult when in truth she quite fancied the idea why not james said still smiling because we might get caught james grinned and raised his index finger to tap lily on the nose wait here he told her and rushed down the stairs to the floor and up his own staircase lily sighed as she sank down onto the window ledge and looked out into the blizzard outside it was beginning to lessen now the flakes were beginning to slow down their rush in mad directions and simply floated gently downwards to the fluffy white grounds beautiful she thought wouldntit be nice to go outside even if it was with potter she heard him climb back up the stairs and turned to see him carrying something silvery and silky surprise he grinned holding it out to her she frowned as she reached out to touch it it felt just like it looked this isnt she asked looking up at his grinning face it is james nodded lily laughed and leaned back against the window an invisibility cloak she said i should have known so james said we re hungry yes are you in or are you out lily looked back out of the window for a moment then she looked up at the head boy there was a strange look on his face it was like the tone in his voice that day he had kissed her cheek after the quidditch match i in james could not remember ever being so close to lily in his life with his being quite tall they had to walk extremely close together to avoid giving the impression that two pairs of feet were walking around the castle of their own accord although personally james didntsee what was so wrong with that image stranger things had happened in the castle most of them from his own creation still he revelled in the warmth that seeped between them and the feel of her hair when a stray lock played on his neck although with all the above things to contemplate it was hard to focus on not tripping over the small red head in front of him lily sighed potter kept stepping on the backs of her heals she supposed it wasnthis fault because even though the cloak was bigger than it looked potter was still too tall for his own good no that wasntfair just because she was a short arse didntgive her the right to be bitter they arrived at a painting of a bowl of fruit james tickled the pear and lily watched in mild interest as the giggling fruit transformed into the door handle which james used to push open a door in the wall he then swept the invisibility cloak off himself and lily and pushed her inside within five minutes they were settled on the floor on a thick blanket surrounded by house elves scampering around serving what must have been every morsel food they had left over from the christmas lunch this is extraordinary lily said watching as hogwarts crested tea towels flapped in the wind as the elves hurried to and fro isntit grinned james see those massive tables there they set the food on those before every meal and then all the food goes up to the tables in the great hall because they re in the same position how do you know that lily asked well the head boy smiled the marauders and i may have had an extensive interest in experimenting with various magical chemicals in the slytherins food i repeat james why are you here and what have you done with the real head boy james laughed as an individual elf detached itself from the tornado and bowed to lily drink miss head girl lily it squeaked regally which lily didntthink was possible oh er she said glancing back at james who nodded slightly would you have any tea miss head girl lily must choose the elf said whom lily was beginning to suspect was female we make earl grey camomile green rose petal fennel malaysian japanese turkish the list went on to mention around sixty eight types of tea some of which lily was sure were not even available to the muggle or magical public at large in the end she chose green and james chose earl grey and two teapots were delivered steaming and accompanied by milk and sugar for james and honey for lily lily watched the leaves in her green tea dance around on the surface for a moment then sink gracefully to the bottom like tired helium balloons she contemplated the oddness of her situation she was sitting in the hogwarts kitchens having missed christmas lunch because potter was stalking her having a picnic in the middle of winter with said stalker and to make the situation even stranger she was actually having quite a good time of it she tipped over onto the blanket and leaned on her elbow crunching a stick of carrot potter was staring at her what she asked devouring the stick and taking a sip of tea james seemed to snap out of his daydream and shook his head a little making his glasses slip down his nose a little nothing he said oh you cantdo that lily said now it ll be bothering me for the rest of the week i was just thinking james said shrugging that you are very pretty almost immediately after the words had exited his mouth he found the end of lily wand pointing at him straight between the eyes potter she said dangerously if this is another tactic to get me to go out with you it not james insisted although he had raised his hands to the gesture that was universally translated as dontshoot i have a wife and two kids i just saying genuinely completely honestly without any particular purpose or ulterior motive or anything like that that you are very pretty all through this speech lily wand had slowly lowered she took a sip of tea to hide the fact that she had felt herself blushing great scott james thought if she was going to be like this every time he said he thought she was pretty he may consider thinking about not doing it again although she had gone a nice shade of red which was more then enough reason to keep doing it soon they were both full of food but they had barely made a tiny dent in the spread that had been laid out for them by the diligent house elves the head students stood up and refused any more food on the grounds that they may explode yum james commented as the door to the kitchens shut behind then and the door handle morphed back into a pear lily hummed softly in agreement before she could think better of it and together they set off back towards the heads dorms because they were on one of the lowest floors of the castle the view across the grounds was spectacular lily stopped walking to stare out of one of the windows spotting the tiny structure of hagrid cabin iced with snow like a cake let go outside james bent down and whispered in her ear she fought not to shiver we can t she said why not he asked with a quiet smile lily glanced at him and the edge of her mouth twitched why not indeed the great doors of hogwarts shut with an almighty creak behind them as their breath rose in clouds in front of their faces lily took a deep breath of freezing air and smiled it really was beautiful she turned to james and grinned last one to the lake is snape girlfriend hey james exclaimed scandalized as lily zipped off through the snow towards the lake he started after her but she had a big lead and she was already laughing at him as he arrived puffing on the snowy edge of the frozen water that was not fair he declared hiding the grin that was fighting to jump onto his face lily put her hands on her hips why are you denying your undying love for snape she teased no james said disgusted before realising the implications of his words i mean oh i always knew you d make a lovely couple lily grinned then she squealed as james pushed her and she slipped onto the frozen lake miraculously she managed to stay upright with a lot of arm flailing potter she cried although there was a smile on her face dont do that what this asked james leaning over and pushing her further out into the lake lily cursed her flat ballet pumps for not having grip on the bottom she tried to wobble her way over to the edge again but slipped straight over and landed on her arse whoops james cringed are you all right lilo potte e er r r r lily whined a pitiful expression her face james felt his stomach sink as he knelt on the snowy grass and reached out a hand towards her quick as a flash lily had grabbed his hands with both her own and tugged sharply james yelled as he was pulled clean off the bank and collided straight into lily sliding them both even further into the middle of the lake somehow he ended up on top of her their legs tangled sorry he said almost as fast as he shifted for fear of getting on her wrong side but she just laughed her head off he began to laugh too as she tried to sit up still giggling i cantbelieve you fell for that she told him and you the king of practical jokes let just say i wasntexpecting it from you james grinned as their laughter faded lily gazed around at the vast expanse of frozen water between them and the bank of the lake what are we going to do now she asked i have to convince her that we re on the same team james didnthave a clue how or why his words at the beginning of term had come back to haunt him so strangely but a moment later it hit him this was his chance we re going to have to tackle this together he said already plans strategies and tactics were going off in the head boy brain like fireworks being captain of quidditch did these things to you and how do you propose we do that potter lily asked well we can safely assume that i heavier than you right we can and i mean it not that far i could probably push you to the bank you could right here we go then whoa wait potter dont wa a ah before lily knew it she was sliding quite fast across the surface of the lake as a result of a sharp push from james oof she said as she came into contact with the bank you re lucky that worked potter she muttered darkly grabbing a hold of some bank side weeds to aid her in the bid of pulling herself off the ice james gave a whoop of delight brilliant he exclaimed still stranded out on the ice it took lily less than a hundredth of a second to catch on to what a nice situation she now found herself in with potter at her mercy marooned on his island of ice she could just simply walk away and leave him there how sweet revenge tasted that would teach him to make her miss christmas lunch by way of stalking so would you mind pulling me in asked james from the lake lily folded her arms across her chest and tilted her head to the side smirking quite honestly potter she said conversationally i dontknow if i will har de har har grinned james not looking at all worried seriously lilo my arse is getting a bit cold here i would be grateful if you would keep your newsflashes about your arse to yourself potter lily said and to punish you for calling me that ridiculous name i think i shall leave you out here all night maybe even all of boxing day as well depends if i can be bothered to get out of bed tomorrow er lily james said looking downwards i dontmean to worry you but i distinctly heard a crack yeah right laughed lily nice try james but you re not going to get round me that way no lily for once in my life i not mucking about this ice is cracking underneath me lily faltered r really she stammered definitely nodded james his voice a little worried by now here pass me that branch yeah that long one there he was cut off however by the fact that the ice beneath him did crack before he knew it he was sinking and then about three seconds after he had plunged into the water below the ice the coldness hit him it was freezing beyond anything he d ever felt before not even if he were a plucked chicken in a muggle freezer he thought would he feel this cold oh bloody hell gasped lily as james vanished under the ice she grabbed the branch she had meant to pick up and rushed towards the frozen lake james was having trouble staying above water level whenever he tried to grab onto the ice it only snapped off in his hands and sunk under his weight suddenly something hard rapped him on the head and he instinctively grabbed onto it whoa lily yelled as james weight pulled her forward a little she steadied herself by grabbing the branch of a tree on the bank and planting her feet firmly on the ground then she pulled james cracked a path through the ice as he was pulled towards the bank when it got too thick to break he had to scramble on top of it until the branch deposited him off onto the snowy grass he was so cold it felt as if his blood had frozen and had stopped giving oxygen to his brain his vision went foggy and he found he couldntmove his limbs james are you all right james james lily grew a bit panicked when he didntreply he had probably gotten hypothermia and was going to die it was when she was rubbing her hands over his chest to get his heart warmed up that she realised he wasntbreathing without hesitation she pinched his nose opened his mouth and clamped her own over his faintly blue lips before she could start breathing the breath of life back into his lungs however she felt him move moreover she felt his lips move and his hand come up to touch her face he was kissing her like a shot she jumped backwards onto the snow as james sat up and blinked potter she exclaimed what do you think you re doing she demanded me he said you re the one who kissed me not that i complaining mind quite the opposite actually you were dead lily accused him as much as i wouldntnever kiss you whilst you re alive i would kiss you even less when you were unconscious i was trying to get you breathing again realisation dawned on james face oh he said slowly is that what muggles do yes that what muggles do potter lily said furiously it called mouth to mouth resuscitation oh james smiled and there was me thinking that muggles just went around randomly kissing innocently unconscious people but this makes a lot more sense well i must say that this mouth to mouth resuscitation of yours was very nice lily gave him an exasperated look and put a hand to her forehead good grief she muttered in a defeated voice what worried her was that she sort of agreed kissing or rather performing mouth to mouth resuscitation on james potter was very nice what would it be like she wondered when his lips werentblue with cold and he was fully conscious lily james said his teeth chattering do you mind if we go inside only i a bit cold lily looked at him and laughed a little come on she said helping him up and they started through the snow back towards the castle how can you kiss someone less than never asked james curiously oh shut up a n hoorah exams were officially over as of yesterday and now i am free free for a whole four months urg never mind also i am now 16 as of last monday hoorah new

for reviewing yet again yeah quidditch players tend to be protective of their seekers probably because they win the most points it makes sense i always thought of the school regarding the head students and other seventh years as minor celebrities of the school i mean they ve had the most time to establish their reputations and people would especially pay attention to lily james and the marauders they sound like they d be infamous from what i ve read d keep reading if wanna find out what happens tracey you read every one of my l j one shots wow tips hat singing i hope you got to read

handy spanish phrases and where to use them according to verity hooch rita skeeter gets down to it and takes the hands on route love your thoughtful and considerate author ix suspects of attack on boxing day lily wobbled blearily down the head girl staircase and out of the door just as james was exiting his own door across the hall for the first time ever the first thing that hopped into her mind was not utter revulsion and downright disgust at the sight of him it was the memory of everything that had happened the day before because she had had a lot of fun last night until that whole mouth to mouth incident that is which she reminded herself wasntall that bad it was quite funny the way james had assumed muggles regularly kissed cataleptics morning muttered james who looked just as tired as she felt morning she muttered back breakfast he asked too sleepy to string more than two words together eehe she made an affirmative noise too sleepy for concrete consonants they strolled down to the great hall in silence it wasnta companionable silence or one filled with a new sense of personal enlightenment or even an awkward silence contemplating new found feelings they were simply too bloody tired to make any conversation sitting down at the late breakfast table remus bid them a good morning and returned to battling with the boxing day crossword puzzle in that day issue of the daily prophet sirius grinned to himself as he caught the drooping eyelids and the sluggish movements of the heads you two look worn out he commented suggestively with a shrewd smirk yes very worn out indeed in less than half an instant both lily and james were wide awake james went as red as a ripe english summer strawberry while lily head jerked up and she narrowed her eyes dangerously at sirius great grindylows thought james from beside her such a look this early in the morning was liable to cause a few traumas are you implying what i think you re implying she asked lethally sirius returned hastily to his scrambled eggs no ma am not at all apologies for the inappropriate implications ma am what a four letter word for endearing asked remus lily answered james without hesitation cute you moron she told him shaking her head you should have thought of that moony sirius scolded him well maybe he has my problem shrugged james suggestively maybe all that comes into his head when he hears the word adorableness is a six letter word that begins with a v remus coughed and hitched the paper higher to hide his face while james sirius and lily sniggered sirius nicked the sports supplement off remus if only to expose his bright face for a moment or two before scrutinising the headlines over his eggs oh would you look at that he said breezily that greyman bloke from the kentucky kites got sacked why would that be on the headlines asked lily up to the neck on drugs james told her most of them from the brand of pumpkin juice that sponsors their team actually oh hey lily i completely forgot what asked lily slightly worried knowing james he had probably forgotten to give her a message about some head girl report or assignment of some kind and it was most likely due in that morning i forgot to give you your christmas present oh good grief it not another pair of hideously tasteless shoes is it lily asked remembering the hilarious har har joke the head boy had made with the nine inch heeled nauseatingly pink shoes james grinned that was good remus commented bloody funny in everyone christmas agreed sirius no james said it better and he shot off towards the heads dorms better than the shoes remus asked sirius as lily contemplated making a run for it shortly james returned with a square box in his hands the sight of this caused several of the students who had remained at hogwarts to turn around in their seats and watch oh sod it it another pair of sodding shoes isntit lily said in horror i told you james said sitting down next to her again and presenting her with the box wrapped in a curly ribbon and emitting the odd decorative red spark every now and then it better it a more expensive pair of sodding shoes then lily surmised regarding the box as if it were a portkey straight to the sahara just open it insisted james holding out the box to her lily gave him one of her dangerous looks and then slowly reached out to pull on the red ribbon sirius looked around at the small audience they now had watching the heads and the tension mounts he muttered sideways to remus the bow undone lily lifted the lid of the box and frowned what in she began to say because the box turned out not to be a box at all the inside of the box was much taller than the outside the result of some careful magic on james part and in the inside of the box was a wooden handle curious beyond all reason lily tugged the handle upwards and out of the box like a lamp out of mary poppins carpet bag came the long wooden body and the smooth twigged tail of a broomstick sirius fork clattered onto his plate as he dropped it in shock is that he stammered is that a broomstick lily said looking at it in surprise that not just a broomstick sirius said feverishly shuffling through the pages of the daily prophet sports supplement until he came to the page he was looking for look lily looked up from her gift and saw that the entire page was taken up by an advertisement there diagonally across the page was the very broom in her hands and above it in magically shiny letters nimbus 1000 available at quidditch supply and broomstick retailers wizarding worldwide price on request price on request thought lily that meant the thing was ridiculously expensive and the retailers wanted to wait until they could blind you with all the broom glory face to face before they attempted to persuade you to hand over a crippling amount of money a nimbus 1000 sirius declared awe in his voice and there was a hiss of amazement over the students in the hall do you like it asked james quietly more than a little conscious of everyone watching them and not too comfortable with it to tell you the truth i know you ll find it useful and all but do you like it how much did pay for this lily asked equally quietly you didntdirty your hands with less than legal methods did you james grinned no he chuckled no she said disbelievingly no pirated merchandise no mafia connections well i cantsay i wasnttempted james teased lily regarded the stick in her hands again and raised her eyebrows in that case she said i may finally have a use for one of your christmas presents potter excuse me for a moment james said holding up his forefinger he turned his back briefly to lily and raised his fist screwing his face up in victory and doing a little punching motion in the air what were we saying he asked as soon as he was facing lily again oh yes i glad i glad too nodded lily placing the broomstick on the table all the better for their little group to look at i glad it not a pair of shoes she added and the boys sniggered lily was finishing some holiday homework in the heads dorms explain as fully as you can why the tidying charm has multiple uses using the words wand form wrist movement and tool shed giving examples wherever possible when there was a knock at the door abandoning her futile attempts at her essay lily got up from the sofa and moved to the door opening it to reveal verity who jumped on her as soon as the door way was wide enough hola verity cried through the hug she had laid on lily i assuming that means hello lily smiled pulling back and grinning at her friend yeah how did you guess that asked verity grinning back lingual intuition lily teased well i didntreally need to learn much else verity said disappointedly apart from dos cervezas por favor what does that mean lily asked two beers please verity informed her well that gives me a big idea of what you did on holiday lily said indeed it does smirked verity well came a voice from behind verity i hope you didntget too pissed to the point of no return because we have another two matches ahead of us hola james como estas asked verity considering she was speaking in spanish her accent seemed very british wot asked james blankly verity wouldntfly under the influence would you veri lily asked her friend against james earlier implications because that wouldntbe very responsible now would it potter i was completely sober in that match against hufflepuff after that party we had the night before james told her matter of factly of course potter and that clear liquid you brought back form hogsmeade in firewhiskey bottles was just water i sure lily nodded kindly well we still won muttered james dismissively looking at the wall so james verity said to him have you been keeping lily occupied i ll say grinned james she had a hard time avoiding me so i caught up with her in the he bought me a broomstick lily interrupted inspecting her nails you bought her a broomstick verity asked james a nimbus 1000 lily said tilting her head to the side a nimbus 1000 verity demand of james no shoes this year lily added no shoes verity queried fraid not james shook his head well that the last time i go abroad without you lot verity said resolutely typical i leave and everything interesting happens oi hooch i thought i heard your voice the three of them turned to spot sirius shouting remus and peter coming down the corridor how was spain asked remus as they neared spain was a right bore compared to what been happening over here verity replied did you know that james bought lily a broomstick we were there remus nodded she seemed pleased oh good otherwise i would have beaten her over the head with it verity declared learn any handy spanish phrases he asked er dos cervezas por favor verity said proudly nice remus chuckled cheers she said oh and los jugadores de quidditch espanoles no me gustan prefiero las comentaristas ingleses remus grinned verity smiled it was about five seconds before they realised that everyone else had begun to go down to lunch hey verity yelled as she and remus ran to catch up that wasntvery nice remus hissed in a whisper to sirius you looked like you were having an interesting conversation sirius whispered back so james verity said sliding up to him what does a girl have to do to get a free nimbus 1000 around here hm let see james mused glancing at lily she has to play quidditch of course right nodded verity she has to have a lovely disposition james said smiling slightly at lily she gave him an odd look she has to be interesting beyond belief shut up potter lily told him she has to be extremely clever james continued genius level compulsory potter lily said dangerously wishing dearly that she hadntleft her wand in the heads dorm she has to be hard working and determined oh and very successful james grinned potter i warning you lily said quickening her pace when he began to walk faster she has to be benevolent and righteous yet able to enjoy herself james said teasingly shut up she said smacking him on the arm compassionate generous spontaneous and fearless sparkling he rattled off lily talents and qualities as lily began to hit him furiously potter say another sneaky devious underhanded word and i ll and drop dead gorgeous lily jumped and clamped her arms around his neck trying to shut his wind pipe but she had a suspicion it wasntworking very well because he was laughing and still talking even with lily clinging to his neck her feet a good ten inches above the ground marvellous amazing fantastic brilliant shut up shut up shut up shut up james was unable to continue because he was laughing so hard he bent over so that lily squealed as she slid sideways off his back he caught her and swung her round so that they were facing her arms round his neck put me down you stupid arse grinning he kissed the freckles on her nose and she struggled straightening her robes when he set her down again i should have you arrested for sexual harassment lily muttered who would help you maintain your tyrannical rule over the student body he teased and she chucked a fist at his arm who indeed came a sickly sweet voice from in front of them james turned to see rita skeeter coming out of the great hall she d come back from the christmas holidays even more tanned than before if that were possible she looked like a terracotta vase with a mop of blond hair hello james she greeted him lily lily looked at her in faint disgust there was a brief silence where the gryffindors and the ravenclaw looked each other up and down in the entrance hall er no james told rita before she had a chance to say anything else we re going to go this way he put an arm around lily shoulders and guided her past the ravenclaw the rest of the marauders and verity swept her up into the great hall james was about to follow them when rita clamped her talons around his arm do i know you he asked digging up the tone in which he used to ask this question at least twice a day during his fifth year james hogwarts hearsay still needs an interview and i still need a date to this weekend hogsmeade trip right nodded james in a disinterested voice well good luck getting either he tried to free himself but she had a quite frightening death grip on his arm perhaps i ve not been clear enough about how i feel about you james she said and james was beginning to feel sick from all the syrup she was pumping into her voice oh you ve been perfectly clear he told her feeling a little unnerved by the way she was manoeuvring him around to face her crystal clear undoubtedly unquestionably undeniably inescapably clear in fact good she said sleazily in his defence james could honestly tell you afterwards that he should have seen that disgusting squelchy awful tasting kiss coming he should have seen it coming but he didn t lily was just about to sit down at the gryffindor table when she noticed that their party was one short grudgingly she admitted that james wasntstupid he couldnthave gotten lost within the three metres that it was from his previous position to the entrance of the great hall sighing she told verity and the rest of the marauders that she was going to look for him and re traced her steps back to the door huffing with indignation she turned into the corridor and froze at the sight before her eyes to her disgust lily could honestly tell you afterwards that she should have seen that repulsive nauseating revolting sight of james and rita coming she should have seen it coming but she didn t the pure feeling of horror that spread through james was quite useful really it seemed to give him some sort of superhuman strength because once he had gotten over the sheer abhorrence of his situation he was able to throw rita off himself and his face and wipe his mouth of a strange clear gunge that had accumulated on his lips rita was about to say something when she seemed to catch sight of someone in the entrance to the hall wanting to know who had witnessed this crime to humanity and fully intending to silence the person forever james turned and saw lily leaning against the thick doorframe apart from a raised eyebrow her face was expressionless having fun she asked james only gaped at her in horror oh yes rita said smirking brilliant fun i glad lily told her unsmiling and turned to walk back into the great hall lily he shouted as he sprinted after her he caught her in the doorway and the people nearest to them turned to see what the head boy was shouting about word spread as soon as the head girl began shouting back don t she yelled suddenly and a few people jumped then her voice lowered to an extremely hazardous hiss much like the one a rattlesnake may use when it is about to devour some poor small rodent dontsay my name with that mouth do not even speak to anyone with that mouth do not befoul the english language with that mouth she sat down on the gryffindor bench with a face like thunder and james threw himself onto the bench next to her but before he could open his mouth to try and explain sirius demanded what is going on prongs what in the name of arse have you done now james turned to his best friend but before he could open his mouth to try and explain lily interrupted he snogged rita skeeter she said breezily as if she couldntcare less the assembled company reacted in very quick succession holy what where why when urg james had had enough and took charge not caring who he interrupted lily listen i didnt snog her she just threw herself at me it was like being in the path of a herd of charging hippogriffs it was the most disgusting thing i have ever experienced in my entire life i was just it was just one second i was standing there trying to escape her claws and next curiously james mouth kept moving but no sound was coming out after regarding this strange sight for a moment or two verity realised that the feeling of her wand in her back pocket was gone and found it in the hand of the head girl who had just cast a silencing charm prongs prongs remus said waving a hand in front of james face who was apparently babbling away but wasntmaking a sound prongs james mouthed something that looked like an impatient what remus jerked a finger toward lily silencing charm canthear a thing you re saying he explained james sighed very obviously and could only sit there next to lily until the silencing charm wore off meanwhile lily enjoyed her dinner in peace while james fidgeted violently with anything that came to hand but did not touch a crumb himself he could see by her face that she obviously didntcare whom he snogged or whom he was attacked by in the hallways but due to his affection for her he seemed to feel it was absolutely imperative that he make it perfectly clear he had nothing whatsoever to do with anything rita skeeter said or did predictably when she stood up to leave he stood up with her lily sighed in a tortured way as the rest of the group watched them leave the only thing she could hope for now was that the spell would not wear off before she had a chance to barricade herself in her dorm of course there was no such luck james voice started to come back first in a whisper then in that interesting tone that nasty people use when they want to seem like they re whispering but actually want the entire room to hear their conversation at last on the stretch of corridor that led to the heads dorms james heard his volume return to where it usually was except slightly higher as is often inflicted by a bit of stress and emotional trauma i just want to make it clear that she attacked me lily that all i want to say he said loopy loo lily said to the door then to james she said testily yes thank you you ve made that clear entering the hall he still wouldntdrop it i mean why on earth would i go and voluntarily snog rita skeeter he shuddered it doesntbear thinking about it yes potter i can imagine lily gritted out through her teeth as she crossed the room to her staircase because number one she horrid number two she horrible to you and number three i fancy you as a result of following her across the room to her door james almost walked into her when she stopped dead and spun round to face him the look on her face was so frosty it could have kept yoghurt fresh for years for the sake of sod potter she hissed with her fingers raised and contorted into claws as if she were thinking of strangling him dontyou understand i couldntcare less who you snog get attacked by james amended pointing a finger briefly whatever lily cried the point is if you had snogged her voluntarily it would have only confirmed my suspicions that you are a sad sick excuse for a moronic twat james face brightened as he brought his finger up to point at her while putting forward his argument but i didnt snog her he said reasonably therefore your suspicions that i am a sad sick excuse for a moronic twat are still only suspicions lily rolled her eyes good grief potter i donthave time for this why are so angry anyway lilo he asked curiously and quite daringly really i dontknow she shouted going a little red in the face i dontknow why i angry all right maybe it because the sight of you and rita skeeter disturbs me so much that the image will be imprinted onto my eyes forever or maybe it because when any of this gets out i ll be made such a fool of and people will say oh poor sad lily evans not even james potter likes her any more her voice went a bit quiet for the next bit or maybe it because i dontlike seeing you kiss anyone else she muttered sullenly as she realised he d weaselled it out of her at last james grinned now we re getting somewhere he said cheerily oh shove off lily said sourly i still hate you and i hate you even more for making me say that she turned back to the door said her password and opened it to go inside and climb into bed maybe she would stay there for the rest of her life lily james called her back just as she was about to shut the door just to point out i didnt kiss anyone else i was attacked lily only just stopped the smile inside her from sneaking its way onto her lips instead she said potter do not speak of it again if you do i shall attack you myself and it shall be entirely different than the sort of attacking skeeter did a n beta
