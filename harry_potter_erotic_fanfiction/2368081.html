thanks to aliceravenclaw and john adams for all their help in beta reading this story and keeping me on character with harry and the gang also for their many suggestions that made this story better than it would have been chapter 3 strength united sleep did not come easily to harry potter that night and by midnight he stopped trying thinking perhaps a bite of food might help for sixteen year old boys are always hungry he trudged downstairs looking for the leftover turkey from dinner as he passed the door of edward lovegood study he noticed the flickering light of the fireplace peeking inside he saw luna father settled in an overstuffed arm chair going over some papers looking up from his work edward lovegood smiled at the young man standing in the doorway good evening harry i thought i might be seeing you tonight you did why harry asked in surprise well when i said goodnight to luna she told me about your outing to the rain cave i remember the day almost thirty years ago when luna mother first took me there i couldntsleep that night either luna mother took you to the rain cave yes harry when i was not much older than you are now i first met elizabeth shaw in my sixth year she was in ravenclaw and i was in hufflepuff by summer break i was hopelessly in love with her her parents invited me to spend the summer here with them and one rainy day she took me to the rain cave but what does it all mean it means that luna like her mother believes in honesty you two are becoming closer and she wants you to know the truth about herself seeing harry blush slightly he hastily added it alright harry i know you and luna are fond of each other and i couldntbe happier luna been alone too much of her life the older man then motioned harry to a comfortable chair opposite him this story started a thousand years ago when conditions were bad for our kind throughout europe it was called the burning time and groups of witch hunters searched every town and village for magical folk the shaws were driven from village to village until they finally came to this forest at that time a family of wood nymphs lived here one of the last family bands in britain the shaws asked if they might stay and make their home here and the nymphs agreed do you know anything about wood nymphs harry only that they re supposed to be extinct yes extinct edward lovegood said sadly extinct for almost eight hundred years they were remarkable creatures harry their whole world revolved around protecting their forest and the creatures that inhabited it back then men had even less regard for the natural world than they do today they cut down whole forests hunting animals to extinction and blighting the land in every way possible but for some reason the nymphs welcomed the shaws and invited them to build their home in the meadow this home for two hundred years the two families lived here peacefully working together to protect the forest the shaws established the magical wards designed to keep out both muggle and magical folk but the time of the nymphs was passing and eventually only a handful were left it sometimes happens like that harry edward said sadly their time had simply passed as each nymph died she was laid to rest in the little valley near their home and from each grave sprung a wild rose bush it said in the family that so long as there are roses in the valley the spirits of the nymphs remain to protect the forest one night the last nymph came to this house to say goodbye passing on the responsibility for the forest to the shaws the next morning they found her dead in the cave the shaws regard the protection of this forest as a sacred trust and to consecrate this trust every child of the family is born in the nymph cave as a parting gift the nymphs endowed their cave with some of their own magic each child born there carries some of that magic with them that what makes luna so uniquely herself do you understand what i saying harry luna is the last of the shaw line her life is bound to this forest she must always return to it as her children must any man who loves her must understand and accept that i was raised in diagon alley my father owned a shop there i was expected to take over the family business i had to decide what i wanted more and i chose elizabeth harry sat silently for several minutes before looking edward lovegood squarely in the eyes thank you sir now i understand you re welcome harry i generally work late at night if you every feel like talking about anything please come down it was nearly 2 00 a m but harry felt he could sleep at last thinking about what he had been told he found that he respected luna even more than he had before o the next morning as they were eating breakfast at the kitchen table a dark object screeched through the kitchen window it looped around the kitchen twice before landing on the table oh isntit adorable luna gushed at ron weasley hyperactive owl oh yeah adorable harry answered smiling his words dripping with sarcasm harry removed the parchment and began to read his smile was soon replaced with a frown dear harry i hear you re stuck at loony lovegood this summer how about escaping and joining us for the rest of the summer hermonie and neville are staying here until term starts we can play some quidditch p s i dontknow how you ve stood it ron harry didntrealize it but luna had been reading the note over his shoulder he could see that she was on the verge of tears i ll understand if you want to go harry really i will i know he your best friend and you must be terribly bored here harry stood and took hold of her hands focusing her eyes onto his i not in the least bit bored and i have no intention of leaving here one minute before i have to and one more thing you are my best friend luna eyes widened as he spoke and harry realized that he meant every word of it do you have a quill and some parchment she brought some over to him from the sideboard and he began to write dear ron thanks for the offer but i very happy here i would love to see you but i going to stay here the rest of the summer as for luna she wonderful you shouldntcall her names she a good friend harry and then he got an idea luna could we ask them to come over for a picnic i d love to see them that sounds wonderful harry quickly he added a postscript to his note why dontall of you come over for a picnic on monday i promise you it will be a day you ll never forget he quickly attached the note to the small owl leg and sent him on his way would you like to go for a swim today harry asked luna immediately brightened and gave him a dazzling smile i d love to o but ron was not smiling when he got harry note in fact he was extremely worried there something wrong hermione i just dontget it harry always spends the end of summer with us and what do you think he means by saying luna wonderful could she have put some kind of a spell on him hermione looked at him in exasperation well i seriously doubt that and the only way you re going to find out is if we go i want to see harry it just that she so well loony i advise you not to say that in front of harry he seems to have taken quite an interest in her ron looked absolutely shocked by hermione remark but with a sigh agreed to the picnic he hastily wrote an acceptance note for all four of them and sent it off o later that evening after luna had gone to bed harry made his way downstairs to edward lovegood study seeing mr lovegood sitting at his desk harry knocked on the frame of the open door good evening harry come in and sit down luna father waved him to a comfortable chair by the fire as he himself got up and took a chair opposite excuse me for interrupting mr lovegood but may i have a word with you harry asked nervously puzzled by his formality and trying to put the young man at ease he responded i always have time to talk to my friends harry and please call me edward my father was mr lovegood i prefer to use first names i know this is not my place but could i talk to you about luna you can talk to me about anything harry thank you sir err edward i ve become very fond of luna this summer and i was wondering if something couldntbe done to make her time at school better in order to carry out her mission she allowed herself to be abused and ridiculed by most of the school especially those people in her own house edward lovegood looked especially distressed by harry words luna has taught me that i need the support of my friends and luna needs that same kind of support what are you asking of me harry edward lovegood asked distress clearly evident in his voice i know i have no right to but i asking you to let her other friends know the truth about the two of you she needs them to understand and support her i trust them with my life and i believe you can trust them as well edward lovegood leaned back in deep thought you may be right harry but the decision is not mine alone i must consult with albus using his wand he immediately extinguished the fire and threw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace as the green flame shot up he leaned into the fire and clearly asked for professor albus dumbledore hogwarts school professor dumbledore responded immediately and luna father asked if he could join them for a few minutes a minute later albus dumbledore stepped out of the flames resplendent in dark blue robes decorated with silver stars and moons wontyou please have a seat albus we have something we need to discuss edward said motioning to a comfortable armchair next to harry s before we start professor dumbledore i want to apologize for my behavior in your office last term i was wrong and i very sorry you ve changed harry responded dumbledore thoughtfully i too am sorry you re becoming a man and i was still treating you as a child i ll try to do better in the future i also want to thank you for allowing me to come here for the summer spending time with luna has really allowed me to get my life back on track yes she a remarkable young woman harry i very glad you know the truth about her she needs your friendship as much as i think you need hers that why we ve asked you here albus edward lovegood interjected harry feels that the secret should be shared with the other students who visited the ministry in this particular circumstance i agree with him luna taught me that our strength lies with our friends luna needs friends that know the truth and will stand by her dumbledore thought about this for a long minute and then agreed but i want to be present when they are told so i can impress upon them the importance of keeping the secret they ll be coming over for a picnic on monday could we tell them then very good i ll be here at ten the next morning harry told luna what he had done at first she was somewhat apprehensive about it fearing that her ability to help might be impaired but harry managed to convince her otherwise by the weekend she was as excited about it as he himself it will be so nice to have some girl friends that i can really talk to not that i canttalk to you harry it alright i understand completely harry replied pulling her onto his lap and kissing her neck ron hermione ginny and neville went by portkey to the lovegood home early monday morning they were weighed down with a large picnic hamper sent by molly weasley ron was having trouble concentrating on harry problem with luna while the fragrant aromas of home cooked chicken and blackberry pie was emanating from the hamper but the sight that greeted them when they appeared in front of the lovegood cottage snapped ron back to reality harry and luna were standing out front holding hands and smiling he not under a spell eh well what do you call that ron muttered to hermione and even she looked a bit worried at his broad smile as luna led then towards the house ron held harry back dontworry mate we ll find a cure a cure a cure for what harry responded thoroughly confused loony put some kind of a love spell on you but we ll find out what it is and break it ron said reassuringly harry eyes blazed with anger and ron stepped back in shock dontcall her that harry snapped savagely and i not under a spell now ron was the one who was confused well if you re not under a spell then what up with you and loo err luna the same thing that up with you and hermione but i not embarrassed to admit it i i dontknow what you re talking about ron stammered and then quickly changing the subject he asked but why luna lovegood she not really very pretty you can do a lot better than her the anger once again rose in harry eyes and he said defiantly there no one in the world better than luna and to me she beautiful dontsay anything more ron you re going to feel bad enough when dumbledore tells you the truth dumbledore is he here right inside waiting for us as they entered the living room of the lovegood home ron was embarrassed to see that everyone was waiting for them in addition to his friends professor dumbledore and a grey haired man whom he took to be luna father were seated there good morning mr weasley thank you for joining us dumbledore said with a smile motioning to a seat next to hermione harry took a seat next to luna on the sofa no one in the room failed to notice that he took her hand professor dumbledore and edward lovegood glanced at each other and smiled last term i made a serious mistake i treated harry as a child and not as the young adult that he has become i failed to recognize that this is your war as much as it ours the outcome of this conflict will dictate your futures last week i apologized to harry and today i want to apologize to you the six of you have formed an unexpected but a very powerful team the future of our cause may very well rest upon all of you remaining united as a team such an alliance requires complete trust and honesty that why harry requested your presence here today it time you learned the truth about the lovegoods and their contribution to our cause this is edward lovegood luna father professor dumbledore said laying a hand on the man shoulder he has been a member of the order of the phoenix since the first war using the extensive contacts of the quibbler he been able to gather valuable information on lord voldemort and his activities at the same time he been able to keep the magical community informed of the truth of what going on and now you need to know the truth about miss lovegood as well he said smiling at luna would you like me to tell them luna luna nodded to the headmaster miss lovegood has been fighting a very lonely part of our war but a very important part for the past few years she has been playing a role for the school one that has allowed her to gather important intelligence for the order but at the same time has subjected her to the ridicule and abuse of her fellow students you asked her to do that hermione asked in outrage it never been a question of asking miss grainger we ve never been able to stop her i ve spoken to her on numerous occasions asking her to leave this work to the adult members of the order but to no avail miss lovegood if you haventnoticed is a very strong and determined young woman and at times her information has proven extremely valuable but now i think she can be even more valuable working as a part of your team i feel that lord voldemort is preparing a major offensive and i believe that you can profit from her unique instincts you would be very wise in following them dumbledore looked very pointedly at harry in the past such a pointed remark would have gotten a rise out of harry but now he just nodded his head and smiled professor dumbledore didntneed to tell harry to listen to luna he had learned that lesson on his own i hope you all understand that this information is strictly confidential no one outside this group may know about it does anyone have a question no well then enjoy your picnic you have a lovely day for it the four of them were so shocked at this point that they had too many questions to narrow it down to just one but there was one more revelation to come there something i need to tell you as well harry began so there ll be no more secrets between us last term all of you thought that the prophecy at the ministry was lost well it wasn t professor dumbledore was present when it was first made and told me its contents he could feel luna squeezing his right hand supportively it said that either voldemort or i must die at the hands of the other we cantboth live that means i have to be either victim or murderer i just wanted you to know that if you stand with me you re standing with a marked man when he finished speaking luna leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and whispered i stand with you his other friends immediately made it clear that they stood with him also to the end with tears of gratitude in his eyes harry suggested that it was time to go on their picnic when the teens had left for the forest professor dumbledore took edward lovegood hand now i certain we re going to win luna led the teens out into the forest with harry and ron bringing up the rear with the hampers ron hadntsaid a word since their meeting with dumbledore and he looked very self conscious uh harry yeah ron you were right about luna sometimes i such a git it alright i glad you know the truth and ron i think you should talk to her too she read your note last week i think it hurt her ron winced at the thought i ll talk to her today he promised on the way to the waterfall where they would have their picnic luna led them to a shady little glade she surprised hermione by asking her to close her eyes ron noticed the wide grin on harry face as luna led hermione into the glade the others following close behind luna reached into a clump of bushes and gently removed something brown and furry and placed it in hermione arms the older girl opened her eyes to see a brown and white creature with a small crumpled horn in the center of its forehead it a snorkack isntit hermione asked in awe one of the last luna answered softly later as they were leaving the glade harry saw hermione give luna a tight hug smiling as tears poured down her face after a cool swim and a good lunch the six teens stretched out on the beach and relaxed harry noticed that they had all paired up he and luna ron and hermione and surprisingly ginny and neville seemed quite close later in the afternoon ron and luna had a serious talk together at the end of which luna kissed him lightly on the cheek ron was blushing like a beet but seemed much happier with himself later as the six of them walked back they all agreed that they had never had a better day somewhere along the way luna asked if they would like to spend the night to which the response was an immediate yes luna father was delighted with the idea and arranged to excuse himself early to work in his study leaving the teens in possession of the living room they talked and laughed until well past midnight hermione was up at the crack of dawn the next morning happily examining the books in the lovegood library luna had given her permission the night before and hermione was delighted with the opportunity she was amazed at some of the rare volumes including some very rare papyrus scrolls from wizards in the egyptian new kingdom period the library also contained merlin original spell books and a diary of rowena ravenclaw it really fantastic hermione gushed as ron had to practically drag her into the kitchen for breakfast yes monie i know he said in a bored tone of voice but you have to eat now while they were sitting at the table eating a large barn owl flew in through the open window with their school letters ron hermione and ginny had all been named school prefects and harry had been named as captain of the gryffindor quidditch team at the bottom of each letter was a note written in gold ink stating that third year students and above would need dress robes for a yule ball luna who had never had dress robes said she was going to have to get them my old robes are too short why dontthe two of us go together we want our robes to complement each other after all and then after a slight pause for effect harry asked sincerely you will go to the ball with me wontyou luna blushed sweetly and answered i d love to will you go with me hermione ron asked a bit embarrassed that harry had put him on the spot without any preparation hermione was shocked ron you re not going to wait until the last minute this year i guess harry a good influence on me well i guess he is i d love to go with you everyone now turned to neville and they were all surprised when he confessed that he had already asked ginny and that she had accepted i wasntgoing to risk someone else asking the prettiest girl in school first and i figured we were due for another ball this christmas ginny turned pink at his complement but leaned over and kissed him on the cheek harry glanced over at ron concerned about his possible reaction to this news but he was pleased and was surprised to see a smile on his friend face they spent the rest of the day at the pool by the waterfall all except hermione that is nobody could pry her out of the lovegood library as they got ready to go home that afternoon everyone said how much they had enjoyed their visit before leaving ron suggest that they all meet at diagon alley the next morning to buy their books and school supplies harry was delighted at how close they had all become o that evening when edward lovegood returned home he had a very worried look on his face after dinner he called harry and luna into his study and closed the door the two teens sat next to each other on the sofa while mr lovegood sat across from them in an arm chair i ve just learned some troubling information about lord voldemort he began gravely and professor dumbledore wanted harry told immediately my agents on the continent have reported the recent disappearance of several renowned alchemists as well as several members of their families in addition to that a number of noted historians specializing in early greek and british history have also disappeared under similar circumstances members of the order and the ministry of magic are working on this and are providing protection to other likely targets we ve also learned that voldemort is searching for magical relics connected to early greece and britain we really dontknow what he up to but we know it not good have you had any recent dreams or visions harry anything that might give us a clue as to what he after no i ve had nothing but good dreams since i ve come here harry responded glancing over at luna there one other thing but i have no idea if it has any real significance at all a number of rare books on the arthurian period have been disappearing from muggle and magical libraries over the past month the pattern of these thefts seems to indicate a high degree of organization as they got up to leave the room edward held harry back for a moment i need to speak to you privately tonight will you come down later harry nodded o later that night harry went down to edward study and knocked on the closed door come in harry please close the door behind you as harry sat down opposite luna father he noticed that the older man face was pale and drawn is there something wrong sir yes harry i afraid there is the older man replied gravely there something more that i need to tell you something i didntwant to mention in front of luna this afternoon i also learned that the two agents that provided me with the information about lord voldemort activities were found tortured to death i reasonably sure that before they died they revealed my part in gathering this information that means voldemort will be looking for me very soon how soon harry asked in shock i really have no idea but if there one thing i ve learned about him it that he doesntact impulsively he ll take his time with planning and then act decisively then i ll stay here with you harry said firmly no it important that you go back to school and complete your training i dontwant you or luna here i ve taken all possible precautions and professor dumbledore has assigned several members of the order for my protection why dontyou come to hogwarts with us you could publish the quibbler from there and you would be safe i cantrun away and hide harry edward said sadly i have a job to do just as you do if he comes for me i ll face him and i pray i ll make my daughter proud but i dontwant anything to happen to you harry said his voice cracking and tears rising in his eyes well dontput me in my grave quite yet edward responded with a grim smile i still planning on bouncing my grandchildren on my knee someday but just in case i can t i want to ask you to watch over luna arthur and molly weasley have agreed to raise luna as one of their own children should the need arise but she needs more than that she needs you harry i ll always be there for luna i promise you harry said with grim determination that all i needed to hear now i can do as i must as harry stood up to leave he suddenly turned around and looked at the older man please dontleave us he said and then quickly left the room edward watched him go and smiled to himself then said under his breath if i had a son o as harry lay in his bed later that night staring at the ceiling he knew he would never be able to sleep the silver moonlight flooded into the room through the open windows making it almost as bright as day harry turned over to face the door to luna room how could she ever stand her father death in his heart he knew that she couldn t she loved him too much harry made up his mind to talk to dumbledore as soon as he returned to hogwarts there had to be something more he could do suddenly the door swung silently open and a dark form entered his room harry recognized it immediately as grimmy as she walked over to the side of the bed the wolf put its front paws on the side of the bed and pulled herself up until she was hovering over harry she looked down at him and whimpered with concern she then dropped down and ran back to the door turning back at the last minute to look at him the message was clear and harry jumped out of bed and followed as he peered through the open door into luna room he saw her in her bed bathed in silver moonlight he could hear her sobbing and see her trembling slightly he silently walked over to the side of her bed and put a gentle hand on her shoulder are you alright he whispered as she looked up at him he could see silver tears on her cheeks and his heart cracked he sat down on the bed and took her in his arms she buried her head in his chest and continued to cry her warm tears soaking his pajama top harry gently stroked her back and kissed the top of her head as he tried to calm her down finally she was cried out and there were only sobs left she pulled back and looked up into his face her eyes red from crying i alright now harry i really am you know dontyou i was in the kitchen making him a cup of hot chocolate he does so love it i heard the two of you talking through the flue in the kitchen fireplace it connected to the fireplace in his study look lu you could talk to him i sure professor dumbledore would let him publish the quibbler from hogwarts he would be safe there she smiled at him wistfully and laid a gentle hand on his cheek i must let him do what his duty requires she said sadly and i must never let him know that i know harry looked into her silver grey eyes and marveled at this young girl you re so brave he whispered and kissed her gently as he stood up to leave he looked back into her sad eyes knowing full well that she wouldntsleep a wink her eyes held such courage and such sadness that it tore at his heart she was still holding his hand he stood there for a minute thinking and then said move over she looked up at him questioningly for a moment and then smiled slightly and scooted over harry lifted the covers and climbed in beside her he wrapped his arms around her protectively and she laid her head on his chest just as she was drifting off to sleep she whispered thank you harry as harry himself was falling asleep he made up his mind that he wanted luna to always be a part of his life o when harry awoke the next morning he found that he was looking into a pair of beautiful silver eyes good morning sleepy head she giggled i didntthink you were ever going to wake up harry yawned and stretched bring an arm down around luna shoulders i didntwant to wake up he said sleepily i always sleep so well when i with you luna smiled and colored slightly well it time to get up we re meeting ron and hermione at diagon alley in two hours aw cantwe sleep for another hour he said giving her that sad puppy dog look that always melted her heart well okay but i think that i should tell you that dad sometimes likes to look in on me in the morning the look of shock and fear that appeared on harry face was something that luna would always remember the young boy practically flew out of the bed caught his foot in the ruffle of the bedspread and fell face first on the floor with a loud thud harry looked up from the floor where he had fallen and saw luna on the bed rolling back and forth laughing uncontrollably she was pointing at him with one hand and holding her midsection with the other laughing until tears ran down her face what so funny he managed to spit out as he slowly got to his feet you are she managed to gasp her eyes sparkling with tears of mirth you looked like a frightened snorkack you know dad always goes to work at seven and now it nearly nine she giggled pointing at the clock on the bedside table harry looked first at luna then at the clock and then back at luna then he started to laugh as well she had gotten him and she had gotten him good alright lu you got me harry said standing over her now it my turn and with that he dived onto the bed and started to tickle her they rolled around on the bed laughing for some time until they stopped and stared into each others eyes do we really have to go harry asked if we don t they ll come looking for us answered luna breathlessly well if we must we must then after a pause he observed i see you re feeling better this morning luna looked suddenly quite embarrassed and lowered her gaze to the floor i sorry harry she mumbled i lost faith in dad and in you i was very wrong i know dad will come through this alright and i know that you ll win in the end i have faith in you she said with conviction placing a gentle hand on his arm and harry thank you for last night harry pulled her into his arms and held her tightly i love you so much lu disclaimer the characters and their world are the property of j k rowling various publishers and warner bros no money is being made and no copyright infringement is intended author note my special thanks to aliceravenclaw and john adams for all their help in beta reading this story and keeping me on character with harry and the gang also for their many suggestions that made this story better than it would have been chapter 8 the right partner some people thought that harry potter was the bravest boy in the world his girlfriend luna lovegood certainly thought so and his other friends did as well and harry was brave he had already faced lord voldemort several times and fully realized that in the end one of them must die at the hands of the other and that he could accept but as the snows of late november turned hogwarts castle into a picture out of a fairy tale harry potter was more and more preoccupied by one gnawing fear that fear was that at the yule ball he would embarrass himself and luna lovegood on the dance floor harry potter was no dancer the night of his first yule ball two years before he discovered that he didnteven like to dance but this wasntfor him it was for luna he wanted to make this ball the happiest night of her life and he would do anything to accomplish that as the days got closer harry level of fear grew late one night when he and hermione were alone in the common room he broached the subject uh hermione um she answered absently i ah really want to make the yule ball special for luna and um could you teach me to dance hermione took in a sharp breath and there was a rather fearful look on her face she knew what he was asking and what she would be letting herself in for but he was her best friend and he needed her i would be happy to teach you to dance harry she replied managing a weak smile the two met in the room of requirement whenever they could find the time and the experience was everything that hermione feared that it would be how anyone could be so graceful on a broom and so clumsy on the dance floor was something that she simply could not fathom it seemed like every second step was on her foot but she persevered nonetheless she didntknow that ron was going through exactly the same thing with luna who wanted desperately to make the night wonderful for harry luna hated dancing at least she thought she did she had never danced with anyone before in her life she had very timidly asked ron to teach her and as she was one of his very best friends he agreed she didntstep on his feet well not that often anyway but she had this annoying habit of going her own way and not allowing him to lead the fact that hermione was spending so much unexplained private time with harry was also quite disturbing to ron and he had to find out what was going on one night when they were alone he asked her um hermione you and harry is something going on with you two hermione looked absolutely shocked for a minute and then just a little bit pleased thinking about it for a second she decided that there was no reason why ron shouldntknow the truth she put a gentle hand on his shoulder and snuggled up close to him no nothing at all the truth is that i teaching harry to dance he wants to show luna a particularly good time at the yule ball a surprised look came over ron face and he started laughing you re teaching harry he choked out i teaching luna to dance for the very same reason they started to compare notes and later that evening when harry and luna returned from an evening walk they both broke out in a fit of giggles they refused to tell their friends why they were laughing but it became so bad that they had to leave the common room when harry became annoyed but hermione wasntlaughing a few days later when she limped into the gryffindor common room after her latest dance lesson with harry she saw ron sitting on the sofa by the fire and hobbled over to him dropping down at his side bad session he asked sympathetically putting an arm around her shoulders i just dontunderstand it she said is despair how can he be so graceful on a broom and yet be so very clumsy at dancing i know what you mean a half hour ago i was with luna and it was like a wresting match she cantjust follow she always has to go her own way i dontknow if we can survive this ron hermione said rubbing her sore feet but they did survive and two weeks later hermione reached the point where she was reasonably certain that harry wouldntcripple luna if they danced together ron had gotten luna used to the concept of following a partner at least most of the time they both still had their doubts but it was time to try the two of them together so ron and hermione arranged for simultaneous lessons in the room of requirement without telling either harry or luna what they were planning when they all arrived they sprung their surprise it time the two of you started practicing together ron said the ball is only two weeks away and you need to start dancing together hermione waved her wand and the wizard radio started to play an old fashioned waltz she had hoped for something more contemporary so that they could dance further apart for the sake of luna feet but sometimes you just have to take what you can get hermione watched as harry very self consciously took luna in his arms and they started to move to the music but something was wrong this wasntthe way ron and hermione thought it would go the two of them were beautiful together they danced like they flew together in perfect harmony it was like they had been dancing together all their lives ron and hermione looked at each other in shock and they had the strange feeling that they had somehow been cheated these werentthe same people they had danced with and something else that was strange these two people were obviously having too much fun harry and luna hated dancing but now both wore wide smiles for just a second the idea of possession flashed through hermione mind but she quickly dismissed it then she felt ron hand in hers and he whispered into her ear teachers need to relax too may i have this dance she blushed slightly but took his hand as he led her out onto the floor the four teens danced until past midnight and it turned out to be a lovely night for all concerned o but dancing wasntthe only thing on their minds school was equally exciting their defense classes with tonks and moody had been exciting and fun and all six teens were looking forward to their first class with remus lupin tonks took great delight in hinting at a special surprise that lupin had in store for them but wouldntsay what it was when they entered the room of requirement for the first class they were all surprised to see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall and remus lupin seated on a sofa in front of the fireplace professor dumbledore smiled warmly at the six and invited them to be seated in the last two months the six of you have made remarkable progress with your advanced lessons now we want to give you the opportunity to experience something truly unique i would like to ask remus lupin to tell you about it dumbledore said with a flourish of his hand remus lupin looked as tired and careworn as always but he had a broad smile on his face as he began to speak do you know what this is harry he asked holding up a worn red leather book harry shook his head and lupin smile grew broader still well this is the key to a very advanced form of magic as i think you all know both harry father and godfather were animagus that is they had the ability to change into an animal form of their choice this ability is extremely rare in the wizarding world and has always been a naturally occurring gift as you know professor mcgonagall has the ability to change into a cat but james and sirius were different their transformations were accomplished artificially over a period of years they were able to develop special potions and spells that allowed them to become animagus they did that so they could keep me company during my own err transformations this is the journal of sirius black for the last six months of his life he carefully documented the spells and potions he and james used to accomplish their transformations he regarded this as a great gift harry one that he wanted to share with you tears rose up unbidden in harry eyes and without a word being said he felt luna move closer to him and squeeze his hand reassuringly when sirius left us this journal came to me with instructions from him that it be given to you when you were ready for it when i learned about these special defense classes i brought it to professor dumbledore for the last two months professor mcgonagall and i have been refining his notes and developing a course of work which will we believe allow all six of you to become animagus if you re interested that is interested was something of an understatement all six teens were thrilled at the prospect and were literally bubbling over with questions excuse me remus but why exactly did sirius consider this ability such a great gift harry asked an excellent question harry as you know sirius spent a great deal of time in his dog form both he and james felt a sense of freedom in their animal forms that they found very exhilarating they both said that it was incredibly liberating to run through the forest as an animal my own transformations were never that pleasurable remus said with a touch of bitterness but besides that the ability to change into an animal can give you an important edge when dealing with voldemort and his death eaters but all animagus are required to be registered with the ministry hermione said wontvoldemort be able to find out about our new forms very good miss grainger all animagus are indeed required to be registered but you six and the aurors that use this program after you will be registered with the minister of magic personally only he will have access to your files what we need you to do tonight is sit down together and discuss what you want your animagus form to be at our next session we will begin with the actual processes involved with that the three teachers stood and left the room of requirement to the six teens ron hermione ginny and neville quickly fell into a heated discussion of the pros and cons of each animal form but i still say that one of us should be a bug or a mouse hermione insisted we could get right in with the enemy and listen to their plans just like rita skitter was able to do it sounds good hermione but just remember that voldemort has a pet snake i dontfancy becoming lunch for that thing a hawk is the animal for me fast and powerful i want to be able to get out of trouble as fast as i can get into it you ll never be able to do that big brother ginny said teasingly as the discussion went back and forth they all began to notice that harry and luna were sitting peacefully on the sofa not participating at all arentyou two interested at all ron asked with just a touch of annoyance it not that harry responded it just we ve already decided on our animals so what animals have you decided upon ginny said impatiently i going to be a stag harry said with determination that was my father animagus form and i want to be a wolf luna declared a wolf hermione asked in amazement why a wolf i thought you would choose something unusual like a snorkack i think luna would make a cute wolf harry said kissing her quickly on the neck ron and hermione looked at each other and smiled they were delighted that harry and luna had each other it had taken away a lot of the guilt they had felt the previous semester when they had gone off alone better be careful mate ron said slyly i understand that wolves have sharp teeth harry gave luna a scared little boy look and asked coyly you wouldntbite me would you luna giggled as she replied i d never bite i might nibble a little but never bite hermione looked absolutely scandalized when harry replied that nibbling was okay in the final selection hermione chose a snowy owl ron selected a hawk ginny a tigress and neville a lion they all eagerly looked forward to their training o in addition to their defense class harry and luna loved quidditch practice luna had become the unofficial eighth member of the gryffindor quidditch team and worked unceasingly with each member of the team during the party after their first game against slytherin where they won 240 to 10 the team had presented luna with her own set of gryffindor quidditch robes she had never been so happy in all her life she was accepted she never dared wear the robes because her ravenclaw housemates already considered her a traitor but just having them meant a great deal she had them securely packed away under her bed one sunday in late november the gryffindor team was out on the pitch practicing when the slytherin team walked up with their brooms they completely ignored the gryffindors and began practicing at the other end of the pitch luna was working with the chasers practicing passing tactics from high above harry saw draco malfoy streaking down the pitch toward the gryffindor chasers who were hovering directly in his line of flight it was as if in slow motion that he saw malfoy crash into luna sending her hurtling earthwards every thought in harry mind vanished except that he had to get to luna he put his firebolt into a vertical power dive braking just inches above the ground leaping off his broom he knelt down beside her cradling her limp body in his arms malfoy was hovered some twenty feet above them laughing she needs to keep that piece of junk of hers off the pitch or there are bound to be accidents he never even saw the blur of scarlet shooting towards him but he felt the impact when it crashed into his blind side malfoy was knocked sideways off his broom and fell to earth hitting the snow covered ground with a sickening thud ron weasley had flown all the way from the goal and had knocked malfoy off his broom he shot down to the ground drew his wand and shaking with rage aimed it at the unconscious slytherin no ron don t please don t screamed hermione from where she had run onto the pitch mr weasley stop mr weasley put the wand down shouted madam hooch who had run over from the far side of the pitch taking a deep breath but still shaking ron slowly lowered his wand now go over and check on your friends she ordered looking up in the air madan hooch saw that every gryffindor player had their wands drawn and grimly aimed at their slytherin opposite numbers the slightest spark would start a war all of you she shouted put away your wands and land immediately the gryffindor players reluctantly obeyed and flew down to where harry knelt beside luna as she was just regaining consciousness are you alright lu harry asked in a voice as close to panic as anyone had ever heard from him my knee luna said wincing in pain hermione used a first aid spell to dull the pain as harry picked luna up and carried her to the hospital wing refusing repeated offers of assistance along the way the gryffindor team following close behind him then madam hooch turned and walked grimly over to draco malfoy who had just regained consciousness in spite of his pain he was screaming in anger you all saw it weasley tried to kill me i want him expelled immediately i demand silence ordered madam hooch in a fierce voice that made them all freeze i did indeed see what happened i saw you violently attack miss lovegood i think it very likely that you will be the one expelled mr malfoy now to the headmaster office immediately but my injuries what about my injuries he demanded you will either go to the headmaster office now under your own power or i will ask ron weasley to come back and help you draco went pale as a sheet but managed to get to his feet and hobble up the hill madam hooch walked behind him watching the angry students gathering on either side luna had made many friends over the past weeks and much as she disliked the idea she might have to protect draco from them she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw professor dumbledore leave the castle and walk towards them students who saw him that day said it was something that they would never forget the raw fury in his eyes terrified all of them meanwhile harry had reached the hospital wing and gently laid luna in a bed by the door madam pomfrey asked the teens to leave so she could make her examination but when luna refused to release harry hand she agreed that he could stay her injury turned out to be a serious break and the medi witch insisted that luna needed to remain and rest for two or three days while harry stayed with luna a very angry ron weasley went looking for malfoy he was soon joined by ginny and neville at first hermione tried to stop them even though she knew in her heart that nothing in the world could do that and then decided to join them fortunately for draco professor dumbledore had already expelled him and escorted the boy off school grounds he had demanded the right to pack his trunk and say goodbye to his friends your wishes are not served here dumbledore declared his eyes flashing with fury i would prefer that none of miss lovegood friends find you although you certainly deserve what they would do to you you are leaving hogwarts this minute or you will probably never leave it draco left with no further arguments o harry sat up with luna until late that night only leaving for long enough to send a reassuring message to her father luna had so many visitors that it really surprised her professors dumbledore mcgonagall flitwick and lupin all came by for visits nearly every student in gryffindor house paid her a visit and many hufflepuffs as well the gryffindor quidditch team spent most of the day as did hermione and neville and of course there was harry harry who never left who held her hand the whole time but no one failed to notice that not a single ravenclaw came not one at nine o clock madam pomfrey told harry that he had to go that luna needed her sleep after kissing her goodnight he reluctantly went up to gryffindor tower put on his pajamas and went to bed he lay there for the longest time staring at the ceiling but he just couldntgo to sleep finally he got up covered himself with his invisibility cloak and went back to the hospital wing madam pomfrey was nowhere to be seen he quietly shifted an empty bed next to luna and lay down beside her covered by his invisibility cloak finally he was able to sleep later that night when madam pomfrey made her rounds she noticed that a bed had been moved and that its mattress was curiously depressed leaning down she felt the warm form of an invisible body lying on the bed carefully she peeled back the invisibility cloak to reveal a sleeping harry potter his hair was more tousled than usual and he looked so very young she knew he must love the girl sleeping at his side very much to have that kind of love so early in life was truly a gift and no matter what fate had in store for them the old witch thought them very lucky she smiled down at the two children professor dumbledore had already advised her of their relationship she shook her head as if one look wouldnttell her that these two werentdeeply in love he had told her in a sad voice that he didntwant their relationship to be interfered with madam pomfrey had worked with albus dumbledore for more than thirty years and she knew that his wisdom was beyond understanding and yet when he talked about these two children she sensed a great sadness why she didntwant to know sometimes it better not knowing she carefully covered the boy with a blanket and left him to sleep at seven o clock the next morning she gently woke harry up at first he was very embarrassed that he had been caught but the nurse didntseem angry at all if you go down to the great hall and get a tray you and miss lovegood can have breakfast together before your first class she said harry gave her a wide smile and hurried away luna woke up shortly after harry left at first she didntrecognize where she was she thought that she was in the hospital wing but here she was surrounded by flowers and candy and dozens and dozens of get well cards by the side of her bed were four large vases of beautifully arranged flowers the bouquet on the end caught her immediate attention it was a beautiful arrangement of red yellow and pink wild roses who knew that she loved wild roses more than any other flower in the world she wondered and took the card from the bouquet it was signed with love always harry and then in a postscript he had written i asked your father to send these from the valley of the rain cave i dontthink the nymphs would have minded she smiled to herself how can he be so incredibly sweet she wondered someone who had lived the life he had and was still so very sweet and gentle she felt like the luckiest girl in the world then she looked at the other cards deep red roses from ron hermione ginny and neville lovely silver pink roses from minerva who had became such a good friend and finally tulips and daffodils from professor dumbledore spring flowers in the depth of winter but then albus dumbledore could do almost anything but it wasntjust these there was candy from the girls of hufflepuff more flowers from the gryffindor quidditch team violets and baby breath from clara thomas and good wishes from all the friends she had made she was crying when harry returned and he had to hold her in his arms for several minutes before she could stop she was just so very very happy o after harry went to class professor mcgonagall came up to visit luna was sitting at a table near her bed writing furiously professor mcgonagall couldntexplain her affinity for this strange child except that she too had experienced loneliness as a girl also luna sitting up with her on the night she had lost her friend touched her deeply good morning luna arentyou supposed to be in bed resting good morning minerva the young girl said a bit sheepishly i know i should be resting but if i ever fall behind on this homework i ll never get caught up what are you working on i have to do a three foot report on the medical uses of osha root and mugwort for professor snape professor mcgonagall made a face that showed obvious distaste at the mention of the potion master name luna giggled harry always looks like that when we talk about professor snape too in spite of herself minerva mcgonagall smiled he really an excellent potions instructor but doesnthave the best personality she hesitated a moment and then changed the subject abruptly luna all your close friends are in gryffindor house are they not yes luna answered uncertainly would you consider transferring to our house i sure you would be happier and we would all love to have you including myself luna looked sad for a moment yes minerva i probably would be happier but i cantdo it my mother was in ravenclaw and my father was so proud when i was sorted there i just cantallow them to drive me out the old woman sniffed as she stood up she laid a gentle hand on the young girls head they re not worthy of you i think the sorting hat made a mistake in your case you re too brave for a ravenclaw you re always welcome with us anytime you change your mind then the old woman hurried away before the tears came o remus lupin was proving to be an excellent instructor for the special defense training class and the animagus training proceeded faster than anyone would have thought possible within the first ten days harry and luna had managed to put on a thick coat of fur and assumed the shape of their animal although luna joked that harry looked more like a horse than a stag after one session as they were walking back to their dorms luna got a mischievous glint in her eyes she came up behind harry and jumped on his back give me a ride horsey she screamed in mirth harry grabbed her legs and started running down the hallway laughing carrying her on his back cho chang gave them a disgusted look as they passed her and that just made them laugh all the harder as the days went on the teens became better and better at their transformations neville was roaring so loud that the walls actually shook and he had developed a beautiful tawny coat and mane that ginny weasley thought was very sexy ginny tiger form was just as good and neville joked that she looked beautiful in stripes a statement that always caused ginny to blush furiously only hermione granger seemed to be having some difficulty she had gotten the form of a snowy owl but had very few feathers and she found that fact very embarrassing it didnthelp when she overheard ron refer to her as looking like a plucked chicken she went to luna in tears and she and harry worked with hermione until she was perfect then she got even with ron swooping down on him and plucking out some of his tail feathers ron complained to harry later that he thought she was going to take his head off with that dive and losing the tail feathers really hurt once again harry warned ron to be careful about what he said in front of the girls that they could take care of themselves but ron only seemed to learn the hard way one night harry and ron were watching as neville and ginny were switching back and forth between their human and animal forms harry was admiring ginny beautiful tiger coat but ron just brushed it off and said she looks like a big house cat it was definitely the wrong thing to say for along with the tiger beautiful coat ginny also received the tiger acute hearing she swung around to face her brother snapping her steel jaws together with a loud crashing sound as she walked towards him head lowered and ears back real fear showed on ron face he quickly turned into his hawk form and flew up landing on the chandelier everyone else in the room was rolling with laughter ginny took up a position directly below the chandelier licking her chops menacingly her shining yellow eyes on the trembling hawk above her ron looked down from his perch knowing perfectly well what ginny was thinking come down brother and let me stroke your pretty feathers with my teeth ron spent the rest of the session up in the chandelier thinking that ginny had become a little bit too much like a tiger to suit him o later that week harry sat by the window of his dorm room he was staring out at the bitter cold blizzard that had blown up outside the storm had arrived the previous night and was now blowing with full fury the temperatures had plummeted as an icy wind ripped across the castles open battlements all outdoor classes had been canceled and students generally tried to stay close to the warmth of their common rooms but even the thick stone walls of hogwarts castle couldntkeep out the sound of the moaning wind turning away from the window harry noticed that neville was sitting in the middle of his bed surrounded by catalogs what are you doing neville harry asked curious about the large pile of catalogs that were now beginning to overflow onto the floor i trying to find a christmas present for ginny neville replied tossing another catalog aside i want it to be special and unique i want it to say how i feel about her no present can say that harry said gently picking up one of neville catalogs you have to tell her that i know i know i just get tongue tied when i around her how about you harry any luck finding a present for luna she cantbe the easiest person to buy for no she not and it really driving me crazy i want it to be perfect too seamus finnigan sitting over on his bed reading called out you could always get her another silly hat she doesntseem to have enough of them he expected his remarks to be greeted with waves of laughter from ron and neville instead they were met with stony silence and some very ugly looks he quickly went back to his books in silence harry knew that he was running out of time but he just couldntthink about it anymore he went to bed in frustration late that night he sat up in bed with a flash of inspiration the kind of inspiration that often comes to one only in dreams he leaped out of bed grabbing his glasses as he did so and rushed to his desk he pulled out parchment and a quill and started to write furiously ron rolled over and shielded his eyes from the torch burning above harry desk what going on harry he asked obviously more interested in sleep than an answer nothing ron go back to sleep harry hastily answered as he applied a wax seal to the scroll he had just finished writing he quickly put out the torch and threw on his cloak over his pajamas with his lighted wand he made his way down to the common room out the portrait hole and then up to the owlery tower at first hedwig was reluctant to answer her master call but finally the loyal bird flew down and lighted on harry arm i know it late harry said but i need this message delivered to diagon alley tomorrow she gave him a slightly annoyed hoot but extended her leg nevertheless as he attached the message he gave her directions on where to take it the bird nipped harry gently and then spread her great wings and flew out into the night harry waited nervously the whole next day for a reply he checked the owlery at every opportunity but hedwig had not returned he knew that she had a long flight and she probably wouldntreturn until the next day but harry hated waiting the next morning at breakfast a flock of nearly a hundred owls flew in through the upper windows of the great hall they soared down to the eagerly waiting students below dropping off newspapers parcels and letters hedwig was among them and she landed right in front of harry he excitedly removed the scroll from her leg she greeted him warmly hooted twice and flew off to the owlery to get some rest fortunately luna hadntcome down yet and harry was able to quickly scan the parchment at first he smiled but then a frown came onto his face he hastily pulled ink and a quill from his backpack and wrote a quick note at the bottom of the letter what going on ron asked curious about his friends strange behavior i ll tell you later i ve got to send this letter right away harry declared as he got up from the table and headed towards the stairs that led to the owlery tower ron and hermione exchanged glances something going on ron stated with certainty two days later the school owl that harry had used to send his last message returned but as he read the message this time harry was all smiles an application came with the letter which harry quickly filled out and returned a week later a package arrived but not addressed to harry he had made arrangements for professor lupin to receive it the last thing harry wanted was for this particular package to be dropped off in the middle of the great hall when he entered professor lupin office his teacher gave him a wide grin it here he said and pulled out a long silver box harry opened the box and gave a low whistle it perfect he exclaimed in admiration luna is a very lucky girl professor lupin declared no harry responded picking up the box i the lucky one you know harry i really like you and luna together you bring out the best in each other harry really appreciated professor lupin comment it was nice that the people they respected accepted them when harry returned to his dorm room with the silver box he found ron and neville waiting for him they were talking in low whispers and looked surprised when he entered okay mate it time to tell what going on ron asked in a serious tone harry looked down at the floor a little sheepishly sorry about the mystery guys i just got a christmas present for luna and i didntwant her to find out you found something that great neville responded with enthusiasm can we see it harry smiled and set the box on his bed and opened it ron eyes got large as galleons as he laid his hand on the glassy smooth handle it a firebolt plus isntit ron asked in awe that right but this is a better broom than yours why not keep this and give luna your old broom because luna deserves the best harry responded a little more defensively than he had intended i wish i was your girlfriend ron said without really thinking oh please ron i donteven want to think about that sorry ron responded turning a little pink about the ears do you think she ll let me ride it come on you know she will harry put the lid back on the box and carefully put it under his bed o one sunday morning in december hagrid was chopping wood outside of his cabin when two second year hufflepuff girls ran frantically up to him professor hagrid professor hagrid something strange is happening in the forest one of them exclaimed now wha all this abou he answered in his normally gruff voice we just saw a stag and a wolf playing together down at the edge of the forest they declared and pointed down the slope no no hagrid responded kindly those two animals are natural enemies they were more likely tryin ta kill each other they were playing the bolder of the two girls insisted adamantly first the wolf would chase the stag in and around the trees and then they would reverse roles and there something else she said a little more shyly when they finished playing they seemed to be err nuzzling each other hagrid gave the girls a strange look show me he ordered they led him down a path to the edge of the forest and sure enough about a hundred meters away he saw a black wolf and a stag standing together they did seem uncommonly friendly but when they saw him they ran off into the trees that evening at dinner hagrid told professor dumbledore about the strange thing he had seen it must be them students puttin love spells on the forest animals it jus isn natural he declared the old man chuckled no hagrid it the most natural thing in the world i wouldntworry about it professor mcgonagall was listening in on their conversation smiling later with a smile on his face professor dumbledore said you might suggest to harry and luna that they go a little deeper into the forest before they transform the next time they seem to be upsetting hagrid yes professor minerva mcgonagall responded with an unusual twinkle in her eye
