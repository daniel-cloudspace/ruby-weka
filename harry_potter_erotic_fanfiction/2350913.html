diappearing the cow where is the cow hidden right now chapter 25 lily left the hospital wing after two days physically feeling back to normal mentally she felt destroyed not just because she was suffering from nightmares of the attack tash had still not regained consciousness and her condition was not growing any more optimistic sirius never left her side except for lessons the evening before lily left the hospital madame pomfrey had caught him sleeping by her side under james invisibility cloak he hadntspoken properly to anyone since the attack lily herself was wracked with guilt she felt that it was her fault that tash was not recovering her friend had taken the curse that was meant for her she had sacrificed herself for her and the worst part was that lily felt useless she hadntbeen able to get rid of the death eaters and now there was nothing she could do to help tash news of the attack had spread quickly round the school and lily found the stares of wonder from the lower years unbearable james barely left her side and lily was glad for his presence to divert her attention from the rest of the student body the slytherins were by far the worst bellatrix was so cheerful it was unbelievable lily felt anger boil in her at the sight of her walking around the school with a satisfied smirk on her face jenny obviously felt the same as she ended up in detention with ramton for hexing a group of second year slytherins for gossiping about the attack the reaction from the teachers was what startled lily the most most of the teachers took to walking around the corridors between lessons as though worried that the death eaters would suddenly appear again ramton was acting exactly like the rest of the slytherins and was walking around with a very creepy looking smile plastered permanently to his face professor amie and flitwick were extremely relieved to see lily back in their classes and but were tactfully not mentioning the attack at all professor mcgonagall on the other hand looked very grave every time she skipped tash name on the register on one occasion lily was sure she had seen their transfiguration professor brush away a tear the workload increased slowly as the days crept closer to april lily found herself struggling to keep up with her homework and began to lose sleep due to nightmares jenny was in a similar state when she wasntwandering round looking like the walking dead she was pestering lily to remember if she recognised any of the death eaters to which lily would constantly reply with a negative answer i keep telling you jenny lily repeated the weekend after the attack they were all wearing black hoods and they were masked i couldnttell who they were did any of them speak jenny asked did you recognise anyone when they hexed you no lily said getting annoyed reliving the attack was not something she was relishing sorry just trying to help jenny said looking down at her book no one can help right now lily said she not waking up and madame pomfrey says its becoming unlikely that she will and it all my fault that hex was meant for me i should be up there yeah and then where would we be jenny snapped back you d be up there instead of tash it would be the same thing just with you two in different places stop it you two remus interrupted now isntthe time to argue our friend is in hospital and she wouldntwant you two fighting over whose fault it is we re grieving we need someone to blame jenny wailed she not dead james reminded them but she not awake either lily said tears appearing in her eyes jenny sobbed into her hands that enough remus said handing jenny a tissue if you want to blame someone james said putting his arms around lily the best thing you can do is blame the death eaters who did this to her when did you two become so wise jenny asked wiping her eyes and hugging lily in apology when we started dating you remus said ooo two weeks after the attack lily was sitting at the breakfast table restlessly picking at her food jenny was still sleeping and james and remus had not appeared yet sirius was no doubt up in the hospital wing as it was the hall was mostly empty except for professors dumbledore amie and a few people at the slytherin table who were sneering at lily thinking of what tash would have done in her situation lily sneered back as evilly as she could good morning lily a bright and cheerful voice interrupted lily and she turned blushing to see the headmaster smiling down at her morning professor lily said trying to smile back at him dumbledore trademark twinkle was dancing in his eyes and how are we this fine day dumbledore enquired as well as can be expected lily muttered looking miserably at her toast dontgive up lily dumbledore said i dontthink she leaving us yet sorry professor lily asked quite sure she had misheard the headmaster but dumbledore was already drifting off back to the staff table lily shook her head and went back to her half eaten toast half an hour later as the rest of the school trickled in she had still not finished it the post owls swooped in as jenny wandered into the hall looking half asleep hate my life she muttered peeves swooped into the dorm and started singing what else is new lily asked he was singing a very bad version of build me up buttercup jenny said quietly lily looked back at her plate trying to banish the memory of tash singing at christmas i just had the strangest conversation with dumbledore she said he said there was a bang in the hallway and the sound of several angry yells lily and jenny bolted in to the entrance hall with about half of the school who ran out to see what was happening snape was sitting in the middle of the floor nursing a very bloody nose he was also glaring evilly at sirius who it seemed had surfaced from the hospital wing temporarily he was screaming bloody murder and james and remus were holding him back i swear to merlin you say anything about tash again and you ll be lucky you still have a head you slimy little ba mr black control yourself mcgonagall commanded snape got to his feet and swept off to the dungeons before anyone could stop him james and remus let go of sirius who was glaring at the door where snape had just disappeared mr black i afraid i ll have to dock twenty house points from gryffindor mcgonagall looked sternly at him and you ll receive detention with me sirius gave an uncaring shrug and disappeared off up the stairs heading in the direction of the hospital wing everyone watched with open mouths wow jenny muttered lily nodded in agreement as mcgonagall shooed everyone back into the hall lily and jen drifted back to the gryffindor table followed by james and remus he is going to be in a lot of trouble when mcgonagall finds him remus said when jenny asked it not a case of when i think it obvious to everyone where he gone he not going to be hard to find what time is it lily asked quarter to nine jenny said checking her watch maybe we should go and see them lily suggested nodding grimly everyone got up from the table trying to ignore the stares they were getting from people their retreat to the hospital wing however was delayed as the group got to the first floor staircase blocking their way were bellatrix rudolphus and snape who nose had been cleaned up out of the way bellatrix jenny snarled oh someone not friendly bellatrix taunted taking the mudbloods place for her whilst she in hospital shut your mouth remus warned reaching for his wand lily did the same broken snivillus james asked nodding at his nose what do you think snape spat i think it has james said with a satisfied smile i ll bet voldemort will be very happy to hear you got beaten up by sirius the three slytherins flinched you dare to say the dark lords name rudolphus hissed yeah we ve got no problem say voldemort name remus said cantsee why the rest of the wizarding world is to be honest he only a sad power crazed maniac shut up bellatrix shrieked you shall not insult the dark lord you will be begging for mercy from him before long you wish lily snarled pushing past them everyone followed i hate her jenny hissed we all do jenny remus consoled we all hate her and the rest of them they ll get what coming to them in the end ooo i dontknow why i did it i just couldntlisten to him any more sirius sat on tash left side stroking her hand spilling out everything that had just happened doubt lily will be impressed that i hit another student or maybe she wouldntcare she and jenny have both been wandering around for the last two weeks like they dontknow where they are bit like me actually they miss you tash we all miss you tears prickled his eyes as he stared at his girlfriends sleeping face i miss you too tash a part of me been dead these last few weeks cause you re not around i only realised last night why i ve been feeling this way why nothing else fills that dead space it because there is nothing else i ve only just realised i love you and it too late to tell you he squeezed her hand and tears fell onto the sheets sirius buried his face next to them and cried quietly the bed covers twitched and there was a faint voice why are

decide on whether to do faster updates or not but i ve decided to put it off for a little longer maybe for another week donthate me i have a good reason reason being okay well i having trouble writing the voldemort scene i want it to be good enough for you all but i having problems with it the biggest one stems from another of my books when i helped to write random scribblings a rather large book in which me and my friends visit other worlds hp included the voldemort scene was really funny so now in this story i having to recast voldemort back into his usual evil self where as i used to writing him as a character that i can poke fun at anyone who has read 101 ways to annoy harass confuse or generally scare lord voldemort will guess what we did bottom line i having trouble writing our friend voldie as evil it hard not to want to add a bit where we start making the death eaters dance the macarena well there you have it i hope i dontkill you wanting quicker updates but as soon as i can get the sticky bit done i will start updating at a faster pace chapter 26 sirius looked at the speaker who seconds ago had been fast asleep sirius you re scaring me why are you crying tash asked you re awake sirius choked out before pulling tash into a hug worthy of jenny ow she feebly protested i thought you were never going to wake up sirius whispered why tash asked in confusion as he let go of her what the last thing you remember sirius asked um tash frowned i remember being in the library yeah me and lily were just leaving we got to the fourth floor and comprehension dawned on her face and she gasped oh my god lily is she okay she fine sirius said she got out of here a little while ago tash looked around the empty hospital wing wait a minute how long have i been in here ooo two months detention i reckon remus said hexing another student is not just going to warrant a lot of house points nah i reckon it ll be for the rest of the term lily said have you ever seen mcgonagall when she really mad she asked as they made their way along the third floor corridor they were interrupted by a very loud and angry voice from the hospital wing two weeks i have been in here for two sodding weeks i must be hearing things cause that sounded like james began but was cut off by the voice i cannot believe i have missed two weeks of my life because of a bunch of death eaters is that jenny asked a grin spreading across her face she awake lily cried running the rest of the way to the hospital wing they all hurried in to find tash sitting still in bed red in the face and extremely cross sirius was covering his ears but was not disguising the obvious grin on his face tasha jenny screamed throwing her arms around her friend who immediately stopped shouting and hugged her back lily joined in we missed you tash lily said as they let go james and remus sat down next to sirius with equally huge grins come here you guys you re not getting away that easy tash said leaning over to hug them how are you feeling lily asked well i was hurting but i felt better after screaming tash said i still cantbelieve i ve been in here for two weeks what did i miss ah wait a minute jenny said i have a bone to pick tash never leave us alone again you hear me loud and clear jen tash nodded fervently and tugged the covers up to her chin in protection what on earth is going on here madam pomfrey hurried in carrying her morning dose of medicines she took on look at tash and let out a shriek dropping her tray of potions in the process natasha you re awake it would seem so tash nodded at this point someone else hurried into the hospital wing obviously attracted by the noise really poppy why all the noise professor mcgonagall asked hey professor tash waved professor mcgonagall jumped in surprise my goodness miss marquand you re awake that the fourth time someone has said that to me so yes i think i must be tash said cheerfully before to everyone surprise mcgonagall hugged her blimey missed you too professor tash said merlin i d better go and inform the headmaster mcgonagall hurried out of the hospital and madam pomfrey hurried to her office to get more medicine right so what did i miss tash asked nothing much jenny said just us all acting maniacally depressed cause you werentaround and jen getting detention for hexing some slytherins lily added jennifer tash said in shock i sorry jenny said they were being horrible about you i ve created a monster tash shook her head gravely and padfoot has been issued with a detention for breaking snapes nose james said go sirius tash smiled i a genius sirius said such a modest one too tash nodded the doors of the hospital wing swung open and dumbledore marched in looking extremely buoyant i see you re back with us natasha i cantleave this lot on their own tash smiled look at the havoc they ve been causing automatically lily and jenny gave her a playful smack on the arm each ow tash protested donthurt me i fragile may i have a word with you alone dumbledore asked yeah shouldntyou all be in lessons tash asked what day is it wednesday lily said we should be in charms we ll come and see you later tash we promise i ll hold you to that tash said hugging each of them as they got up see you later lily waved as she went through the door ooo so when can i get out of here tash asked madam pomfrey looked up from the patient in the next bed if i happy with your progress you can leave on friday she said before disappearing back into her office friday tash groaned i cantwait that long you cantwait two days jenny asked no tash spluttered before grabbing another chocolate frog and ripping it in half lily chuckled and helped herself too more chocolate what seemed like most of their year group had sent tash sweets once they had found out that she was awake unable to finish it herself lily jenny and the marauders were helping her out hope i can catch up okay tash said i mean i did miss a lot of lessons you ll be fine lily said you re not friends with all of us for no reason it ll be worse after easter remus said apparently its all revision classes after the holidays eek tash squeaked we ll be fine it just exams lily said easy for you to say jenny said you passed all of your owls with exceeds expectations or above nine o clock visiting time is over madam pomfrey hurried back over to tash bed and began to shoo them all away sirius you stay a minute tash said as everyone else got up you need rest natasha madam pomfrey looked at her sternly just five minutes tash pleaded pulling a very impressive puppy dog face madam pomfrey crumbled okay but just for five minutes she said before hurrying out great face tash jenny said i ve been taking lessons tash shrugged from who lily asked king of puppy dog faces himself tash said nodding at sirius who beamed hey we can do the face too james said and he and remus pulled their own puppy faces which caused everyone to laugh aww that face can do anything jenny said hugging remus see you all tomorrow tash said lily and jenny waved as they left the hospital wing tash waved back quickly feeling exhausted you look tired sirius said sitting beside her you d think after two weeks of sleeping tired is that last thing i d be tash said rubbing her eyes sirius squeezed her hand sirius tash began turning to look him in the eye what were you saying to me just before i woke up sirius gazed at her i said i loved you and i glad i got the chance to finally tell you tash smiled sleepily i love you too sirius smiled back and planted a sweet kiss on her lips five minutes are over madam pomfrey came striding over talk about inappropriate timing sirius muttered tash giggled night then she said giving her one last hug sirius left the hospital wing feeling the happiest he ever had in his life ooo tash return to school was met with mixed emotions whilst a majority of the students and staff were pleased to see her out of the hospital wing there were a select group who were none too happy at her recovery the slytherins were obviously gutted to see her bellatrix and her group especially so professor ramton also took this mood especially on tash first day back when he decided to set them all a rather large and nasty essay as well as handing tash all the work that she had missed which was bound to take her most of the holidays understandably filch was also feeling rather murderous since tash recovery meant that sirius was back to his normal self and willing to participate in any pranks that the marauders had planned the first morning that tash rejoined the school the boys set off a round of magical fireworks which welcomed her back in large red and gold letters the teachers did not seem to mind this however when bellatrix and rudolphus were found late afternoon caught in a broom closet being attacked by a volley of enchanted water balloons filch and the teachers were none too happy by the start of the easter holidays most of the school had returned to normal lily and james returned from patrolling one evening to find jenny and remus still doing homework nice patrol remus asked would have been fantastic if we hadntcaught bellatrix and rudolphus snogging down by the dungeons lily said eww jenny winced covering her ears are you trying to scar me yes james nodded where padfoot not a clue remus said tash lily asked looking at jenny doing laps in the lake jenny said monotonously scribbling on her parchment at the same time bit late isntit lily asked probably jenny said but she said she missed it and she seems to think that after two weeks of sleeping she out of shape anyway when the wedding remus asked lily knew exactly what he was talking about last weekend of the holidays she said hope petunia want to be civil this is petunia she isntcivil to you jenny said you re making me feel so much better jen lily rolled her eyes the only good thing that coming out of this is that she wontbe living in the same house as me any more and i ll bet the list of bad things that are coming out of this wedding is getting longer by the minute james said too true lily sighed wondering silently what else could go wrong next weekend ooo have a good time jenny hugged lily tightly it was the last week of the holidays and lily and james were preparing to return to muggle world for petunia wedding currently everyone was gathered in professor mcgonagall office to say goodbye a good time you must be joking lily muttered owl us the second you get there tash said and for heaven sake be careful dontworry tash it a wedding lily said the most that going to happen is that petunia going to trip down the aisle or vernon is going to forget his vows now that would be a sight jenny chuckled before pulling lily to one side and rummaging around in her pockets thanks for reminding me lily she finally fished out a bottle of gold potion what that asked lily felix felicis jenny said handing it to her i started brewing it last september after you told me that petuina and vernon were going out i suspected they might get married if he was anything as bad as you said so i thought you might need this to get through it are you sure jen lily asked i mean it a hard potion to make do you really want to waste it i not wasting it jenny said this is a good cause i helping you to keep your sanity thanks feeling slightly overwhelmed not in the least by jenny skill at potions lily slipped the tiny bottle into her pocket ready james asked lily nodded and picked up her trunk i still dontknow why you re taking you whole trunk and not just the stuff you re going to need for the weekend tash shook her head because i not going to leave my books behind lily said we ve got exams in just over a month quite right too miss evans professor mcgonagall came into the room just in time to hear lily last statement haventyou left yet really professor anyone would think you wanted to get rid of us james said in a scandalised voice go on guys tash said and dontforget to owl us lily waved and stepped into the fire first floo powder had never been her favourite method of travel as soon as she d said the name of her house she instantly felt sick the abrupt stop also meant that she fell face flat onto the living room carpet lily the sound of her mothers voice made lily feel much better and she picked herself off the floor just in time to receive a hug goodness me you re covered in soot her mother said yeah that what happens when you travel by fireplace lily said brushing herself off and looking over her shoulder to see james appearing he brushed the soot off himself and stepped out of the fireplace dragging his trunk with him hello james it wonderful to see you again mrs evans smiled great to be back james smiled take you re trunks upstairs i ll get you something to drink lily grinned at her mother as she left hogwarts was great but coming home was something special a n finished there cause the chapter was getting long anyone interested in reading 101 ways to annoy harass confuse or generally scare lord voldemort should search for it on mugglenet com jkr

thanks to the following reviewers kates master sister nazgulgirl tai greywing blvd dreamergirl88 sugur huny bun trainer krystal alex202 moonylovesflo lilyflower28 life2me and heathergernenz a n surprise muses and mei bounce out of hiding places a long note from the author okay i ve started my faster updates prematurely forfourreasons one i a nice kind if a little stupid at times person and you re all wonderful people who deserve faster updates for sticking with me two most important reason i have waded my way through the sticky swampy bit of chapter 34 and the end is in sight 34 and 35 have to be completed and 36 has to be written then i done three its been nearly six months since i started this story and the muses are making a party of it jack is singing doc is dancing fred is basking in the reflected glory of his master piece ie this fanfiction and helen is eating all the chocolate she can lay her little hands paws on finalreason i just want to make this clear i did not write 101 ways to annoy voldemort i just borrowed it for random scribblings lady mearle found it on mugglenet and decided it would be fun to try some of the ideas ie telling voldemort he is mildly depressed and a bit of a control freak or taunting him about his middle name what marvolo does sound like a washing detergent the person who did write it possesses a good sense of humour my sense of humour is slight sorry i didntmake this clear before all i can say is i wish jkr could read my work looking back on my last chapter almost 300 reviews wow i feel extremely overwhelmed muses crowd round as tash hits the floor fred yowch that gotta hurt helen well the floor is made of wood fred think we should revive her helen nah let play twister chapter 27 on saturday morning lily awoke to find herself back in her room at home then she remembered what day it was and groaned aloud lily her mother called from downstairs petunia here groaning some more lily dragged herself out of bed pocketing her wand in her dressing gown pocket she walked downstairs to find james and her father having a discussion about school her mother was busy with the kettle and petunia was sitting at the table with a very scary looking happy expression on her face as lily sat down a sixth person entered the room carrying a large suitcase lily grinned as she recognised her cousin rachel she cried her cousin dropped the bag squeaked and threw her arms around lily lils you re out of school well i wasntabout to miss my sisters wedding lily said adding just a hint of sarcasm to her statement she couldnthelp it and she had missed her cousin who was a special favourite rachel was one of the only people in her family who knew that she was a witch she was fifteen and had dark red hair like lily and her father and blue eyes where are your parents she asked looking for her aunt and uncle hasntyou re mother told you rachel asked lily shook her head dad isntwell so mum stayed with him whilst i came here they said it would be a shame if i had to miss it rachel going to be staying with us for the weekend mrs evans said placing tea on the table for them she ll be with you lily since james has the spare room arentyou going to introduce me to your boyfriend lily rachel asked glancing over her shoulder at james sorry lily said james this is rachel rachel this is james as in the one you always used to complain about whenever i saw you rachel asked starting to grin the one who was so exceedingly arrogant and immature that you couldntstand to be in the same room as him rach lily cringed that was a long time ago apparently i ve matured in the last year james added as lily red faced sat down next to him the bottom dropped out of lily stomach as an owl swooped in with a special edition of the paper not again lily groaned grabbing the paper and reading the headlines rachel was looking in curiosity what that she asked wizard newspaper james explained what happened those death eaters they caught got released without charges lily said in outrage what james asked leaning over to read the headline they all said they were under the imperius curse lily said if that not the biggest load of rubbish i ve ever heard then bellatrix is the most intelligent person ever to have lived poor jenny she going to be so upset what are death eaters rachel asked followers of lord voldemort james said who that rachel asked still looking lost a very evil wizard lily said putting down the paper in disgust they attacked cardiff a few months ago only three of them were caught and now they ve released them and whilst i sure we all find this fascinating petunia interrupted with sarcasm worthy of the slytherins the bridesmaids will be arriving any minute i think this is a little more important than your wedding petunia lily muttered ripping open the paper again to check the list of deaths anyone we know james asked no lily shook her head no one at all been killed they must be planning something big if they ve waited this long there was a knock on the door and petunia got up to answer it must be the dursleys mrs evans said sure enough lily could see petunia greeting two women at the door who could only be vernons mother and sister i going to escape rachel said coming lils think i am lily said getting up and vowing to herself that she would get the shower before anyone else could ooo i pity you lily rachel said everyone says that when they see the dress lily muttered looking at herself in the full length mirror in her room i really do rachel said a smirk escaping her lips you dontreally you re still laughing lily sighed sorry i just cantget over the skirt how did you re friend describe it again curtain maker gone bonkers lily said wishing she could speak to jenny right now then she remembered the good luck potion and decided that she would tuck it into her pocket for later do you think if i took a couple of yards off the skirt petunia would notice i dontthink she would notice an earthquake right now rachel said she too wrapped up in the flower arrangements and the caterers lily nodded and pulled out her wand severo i ll never get used to you doing that rachel said as lily proceeded to trim her skirt well it is helpful in cases like this lily said okay that should be enough she looked back into the mirror ugh it still looks terrible do mine ears deceive me said a voice from the door or did the beautiful miss evans refer to her outfit as terrible james was leaning against the doorframe watching lily snarl in disgust at her reflection are your glasses messed up lily asked i do not look beautiful in this outfit you always look beautiful in anything lily james said in earnest lily rolled her eyes flattery will get you everywhere she muttered the guests are arriving james said gesturing downstairs shall we if we have to lily sighed as they went downstairs they found the rest of the bridesmaids gossiping animatedly in the lounge mrs evans was in all probability still helping petunia to get ready lily james and rachel stood in a corner away from all of petunia giggling friends james mum said you d be sitting by rachel at the reception lily said i ve got to sit at the top table okay as long as i get at least one dance from you james said i promise i will dance with you lily said i have no plans that involve sitting at the table with petunia all day here comes the bride mrs evans swept in with tears of joy in her eyes speak of the devil lily muttered as petunia walked in and was complimented and admired from all angles by her friends lily rachel came a voice from the other end of the room both girls turned to look and saw an older woman come hurrying up to them with a five year old girl clinging to her she looked exactly like lily mother except her dark brown hair was just starting to go white at the temples aunt helen rachel cheered and hugged her lily did the same other than her cousin her aunt was the only other family member that knew about lily being a witch and she was the happiest person apart from jenny that lily knew how school her aunt asked once she had released them from their hugs brilliant lily grinned her aunt glanced over her shoulder and spotted james smiling at them apparently so she nodded it about time you got yourself a boyfriend at least this one is good looking unlike that pig your sister marrying lily and rachel burst into giggles and james chuckled slightly from what lily had told him about vernon aunt helen comment seemed very fitting hello jessica lily said to the little girl jessica seemed quite overwhelmed already by the amount of people in the room and buried her face in her mother skirt aww she grown since i last saw her rachel said come on jess you re not afraid of your cousins are you lily asked jessica peeped round at her with wide blue eyes i mean i can understand being afraid of petunia but we re harmless rachel how your father helen asked as lily attempts to speak with the five year old yielded no response she slipped away to stand by james you re aunt cool james said she is a lot of fun but you canthide anything from her i swear she is a seer lily came another shout lily groaned at the sound of her mother voice it time to leave you re supposed to be in the car with your sister see you later lily said kissing james on the cheek and fighting her way through the crowd to the front door the car journey dragged lily stared absently out of the window trying to ignore the squeaks and tears of happiness from petunia friends who were also sharing the car once they arrived at the church lily immediately stood at the back of the group so she could watch the rest of the guests arrive after ten minutes of waiting they were called into the church lily focused on her flowers as she followed the other bridesmaids down the aisle when she passed james and rachel she received two encouraging smiles and immediately felt better but as soon as she made it to the front of the church the time continued to drag until lily was reduced to picking the petals off her bouquet in boredom finally the priest finished and vernon and petunia were locked in a tight embrace which made lily feel rather sick to watch many of the bridesmaids burst into tears at the sight but dutifully applauded with everyone else pink rose petals now littered the floor around lily just the reception to go she muttered as she joined james and rachel outside and at least you can eat there rachel pointed out we re you two bored out of your minds too lily asked i fell asleep james admitted really he did rachel said i had to poke him awake and he muttered something about quidditch what quidditch wizard sport james said i was dreaming about kicking ravenclaw when we get back i dropped petals over the floor at the front of the church lily said that how bored i was we d better go or there will be no cars left aunt helen had drifted along side them and was now ushering them to the roadside ooo lily may i have this dance james asked the reception was now in full swing now that the dancing had started you certainly may lily said more than ready to leave petunia and vernon behind after having the first dance together there had been continuous toasts and calls for the newly wed couple to kiss all of which had reduced lily to a headache and a queasy stomach is it just me or is the sight of the newlyweds kissing making anyone else nauseous rachel asked quietly it not just you lily assured her as james dragged her off to the dancefloor now miss evans when was the last time i had the pleasure of dancing with you james asked that would be the valentines ball lily said far too long ago james said taking her hands and i believe that last dance was interrupted no chance of that happening here lily said an interruption to those two kissing however would be greatly appreciated so have you enjoyed any of this day or has it all been boring as hell well your cousin is friendly james said your aunt is cool she spent the meal making comparisons between vernon and large animals jessica is cute and barely spoke at all vernon sister what was her name marge lily rolled her eyes that one james continued she knocked her wine glass on to her lap you should have seen it her face was priceless lily chuckled at the idea which i suppose leaves the bride and groom to comment on james finished and all i ll say is i think they re well suited for each other right there lily said glancing up at the top table where vernon was whispering to petuina who seemed on a temporary high from the celebration lily rolled her eyes but couldntcriticise it was her sisters wedding and she had every right to be happy lily wondered would she ever be happy like that ooo that the last of them lily sighed sitting down next to james and rachel it was almost midnight and the reception had finally ended almost everyone had gone home leaving the room deserted except for a few people vernon and petunia were in deep discussion with vernon parents lily parents were coming back inside after saying goodbye to the last people to leave apart from lily james and rachel the only two other people in the room were aunt helen and jessica who had yet to leave due to the fact that helen couldntfind her car keys so glad that over rachel said honestly if i had to

jessica got up jessica was biting her lip to stop herself from crying the door must be jammed lily mother said trying the handle again oh this is just wonderful petunia said tartly dontsee you trying to help lily heard rachel mutter lily james whispered urgently can you still disapperate lily found this an odd question but the look in james eye was all that she needed to her horror however lily found that when she tried to disapperate nothing happened in the distance a clock chimed midnight what going on she hissed i was afraid of this james muttered pulling out his wand anti disapperation jinx afraid of what lily asked remember you said this morning there have been no recent deaths james said i think that because we re their next targets lily felt ice flood into her stomach as from

chapter this aintgonna make much sense enjoy my little daisies chapter 28 avada kedavra lily and james ducked behind the top table as the curse flew over their heads behind them vernons parents were caught in the jets of green light and fell to the floor petunia let out an ear splitting scream lily grabbed her parents and pulled them behind the table with her carpe retractum james shouted a thin golden ribbon shot out of his wand and pulled helen out of harms way petunia and vernon followed obviously realising the danger they were in what going on mr evans asked shouting to be heard over james furious relay of hexes towards their attackers death eaters lily had time to reply before james in the battlefront what can we do her mother freaked fight lily shrieked before ducking another killing curse and stay away from green light jess helen cried lily looked in the same direction and noticed jess cowering in the corner by the door in the panic everyone had forgotten about her now she was a prime target for a death eater lily don t you ll be james trailed off as lily sprinted out from behind the table towards jess james saw the death eaters attention snap towards her invocatum james shouted the nearest death eater stumbled backwards on to another of the tables over in the corner lily was trying to coax jessica out of her hiding place jess come on we have to go i scared jess whispered barely audible over the bangs from the death eaters wands i am too but we need to get behind that table lily said holding out her hand for the girl to take inching forwards jess saw her mother from behind the top table and this finally urged her out of the corner come on lily james muttered gritting his teeth and hexing the next death eater into the wall get out of there there was a yell from behind him another death eater had come within range of the table and had placed lily father under the cruciatus curse rage building james hexed him mr evans fell limp dad lily squeaked as she got back to the table jess immediately crawled into her mothers arms he ll be fine lily james said but we re running out of luck here something about james statement jarred lily memory how could she have forgotten luck james you re a genius am i james asked taking his eyes off the death eaters to look at her yes lily said diving into a pocket as another two killing curses hit the wall behind them keep hexing for merlins sake she pulled out the small bottle of golden potion that jenny had pressed on her before they left felix felicis she showed james who stopped again and grinned where did you get that he asked jenny lily said briefly before swallowing a mouthful and taking over with the attack remind me to kiss her when we get back james said beaming now he took a swig and joined lily another killing curse flew past lily head missing her by inches she stunned the death eater causing him to fall backwards into another with good luck on their side lily and james continued to keep the death eaters away from the table lily was marvelling at the effects that the potion was having on them the hexes that they fired rarely missed their targets and the death eaters were having trouble getting clean shots at them finally there were cracks from outside the building and the sounds of people trying to get in one of the remaining death eaters fired the dark mark out of the window and the rest all disappeared by portkey just as the aurors hurried in you took your time james complained as the aurors began to check over their small group james lily lily looked up to see james parents hurrying over james immediately disappeared under his mothers hug ow mum dontscare me like that mrs potter squeaked before releasing james and giving lily a hug are you both okay she asked think so james said what took you so long we were only alerted two minutes ago his mother said and we couldntapperate in they d covered the whole building with that jinx how the hell did you keep them away it was this lily pulled the bottle of half empty potion out of her pocket that felix felicis james mother said in awe where on earth did you get that jenny lily said she gave it to me just before we left she about the only person in the year who can make one of those potions was anyone hurt mr potter asked oh god dad lily exclaimed hurrying over to the table as she said it her father was propped up against the wall and was surrounded by healers dad are you okay lily asked fighting her way to her father side not really mr evans said my head hurts like hell he ll be okay one of the healer said how long was he under the curse for not long lily said about twenty seconds at the most lily where your sister mrs evans asked suddenly lily looked around and found that petunia and vernon had disappeared they re outside the door rachel said nice fighting you two sorry i wasntmuch help you were great james said you kept calm and that made it much easier for us to concentrate lily didntstick around to hear the conversation she was already at the door she didnthave to look long to find her sister and vernon heading for the door petunia lily called out to her to her amazement petunia ignored her lily ran after them petunia are you okay she asked no thanks to you petunia said turning around to face her you ruined my wedding day i not the one who attacked lily protested no but they were there because of you werentthey petunia snarled they would never have been there if you had stayed at that freak school of yours she took a step closer to lily so that only she could hear what her sister was saying vernon lost his parents tonight i had to tell him what you are he knows it was because of you they died crushed lily took a step closer to her sister stay away lily petunia screamed backing away now you ruined the happiest day of my life i never want to see you again petunia i had nothing to do with that attack lily began you had everything to do with it petunia interrupted loudly her voice drowning out lily s from now on as far as i concerned i have no sister and with those final words she and vernon marched away through the hotel doors as much as she hated her sister blood was still blood and lily knew that she had just lost one of her relatives forever and no matter the anger between them it still hurt like hell ooo lily dontworry james said petunia will come round it was one thirty in the morning and lily james and rachel had returned to the house lily father had been transferred to st mungos where they could keep an eye on him her mother had gone with him no she won t lily sighed i just know she never going to forgive me after this i ruined the best day of her life no you didn t james said firmly they death eaters werentafter you well sort of they were after me really if anyone is to blame it me why dontwe just say no one was to blame rachel suggested then we ll all be happy good idea lily nodded wearily she was exhausted and felt quite content to stay on the sofa in james arms so why were they there anyway rachel asked because lily and i both want to be aurors james said and the sooner voldemort can put us out of the picture the better for him also my parents are aurors so they also want us for that your parents are nice rachel said your mother was trying to help me watch jess whilst they took care of helen lily nodded even though she hadntbeen paying attention she was too worked up over the thought of being haunted by death eaters until she died rachel suddenly gave a yelp as the fireplace burst into life lily and james both leaped up wands drawn easy prongs it me sirius said grinning as he emerged from the fireplace he was almost knocked over as tash spun quickly into view and tripped over the grate ow she complained rubbing her nose bloody floo powder are you two okay sirius asked looking between lily and james as though expecting one of them to suddenly drop dead been better james remarked sitting back down lily was helping tash off the floor how did you get here lily asked her friend floo of course tash gestured at the fireplace lily rolled her eyes oh you meant prior to that tash said well we were just going up to bed when jenny noticed our rings were glowing and so she panicked and we raced up to find sirius before racing over to dumbledore office we told him what was going on and he sent for help but that was about an hour and a half ago lily said frowning at her watch yeah well then he told us to go back to bed sirius wrinkled his nose in disgust at the idea of going to sleep and so we went back to the tower and started thinking of ways to get here so we waited for a while for things to quieten down before we risked getting the powder and flooing here so where are jen and moony james asked well moony is in the hospital wing since tomorrow is the full moon sirius said and jenny went to fill him in she ll be here pretty soon so what happened tash asked sitting down on the sofa sighing lily retold the story for what felt like the hundredth time before jenny appeared followed to their surprise by a very pale and sick looking remus at this point james retold the story for their sake since lily felt close to collapse if we hadnthad that potion we d probably have died james finished from now on i making a batch of that potion every time we go out jenny stated thank you jenny lily gave jenny a sleepy hug which jenny returned full force miss jennifer louise tailby tash stated healer in charge of st mungo s order of merlin first class for saving so many lives the magical florence nightingale

to normal sorry to be a pain chapter 29 fortunately for lily and james sakes the attack was not mentioned in the daily prophet meaning only they and the people they had told knew about the attack which had nearly got them killed but life in school had by no means stayed the same lily grim mood over her sister abandonment cast a black cloud over her friends tash was becoming more alert and aware every time they were in close proximity to slytherins jenny meanwhile continued to work furiously at her supply of potions specialising in those which could help during battle lily and james themselves rarely left each others company and both were rather happy for the upcoming exams to take their mind off what might be happening to the world outside school during the last week of april there was another black letter morning the seven gryffindors had watched the letters arrive to the occupants and a majority of the slytherins looking as though christmas had just arrived early those miserable evil good for nothing little buggers sirius hissed glaring at bellatrix anyone want to hex her so she sticks to the ceiling tash asked cool james said when maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but when she least expects it tash trailed off punching her goblet so that the pumpkin juice hit peter in the face sorry peter tash apologised and vanished the mess peter muttered a very stiff thank you before diving back into his revision quidditch practise this evening james reminded everyone we know sirius jen and tash all answered monotonously again lily asked shouldntyou be taking some days off to revise no jen said aghast at the very thought sirius faked having a heart attack and fell off his seat to a round of laughter noooo tash said dramatically look what you did lily you killed him you d be lucky sirius said pulling himself up with a lopsided grin on his face i dontplan on dying until i ve finally given bellatrix what she deserves and we will happily endeavour to help you james assured his best friend the bell rang and the hall emptied out for class as it was monday the seventh years had history of magic first y know jenny said i bet we could go and attack the slytherins and binns probably wouldntnotice remind me why i signed up to do this for newt level james said because tiger lily was doing it sirius said ah yes james said remembrance finally dawning by all rights i shouldntbe here tash complained i didnteven pass this at owl that why we let you put your head down on the desk and sit quietly lily muttered looking up from her notes hey mudblood which one do you want bellatrix tash asked tartly dontbe blonde marquand bellatrix snarled i want the red haired mudblood get lost bellatrix some of us are trying to work lily hissed did your sister have a nice wedding bellatrix asked in and innocent tone shut up lily snapped going back to her work aww did i touch a nerve bellatrix asked i ll bet she never wants to see you again after all you did ruin her day lily clenched her quill and bit her lip to stop herself from crying or was it because she realised was a useless excuse for a human her sister was next to lily james tensed for a fight but to everyone surprise it was jenny who turned around to retort listen you mind numbingly stupid voldemort worshipping bitch you say anything to lily again and i swear on my green pyjamas that i will kill you bellatrix burst into loud evil laughter which made everyone in the class except for professor binns stare jenny turned back round in her seat we ve rubbed off on jenny james muttered gravely maybe it was the right thing to do lily muttered if fighting back was the only way to stay alive lily decided that it was worth it ooo ready for patrol lily james asked sure lily threw her homework at jen who was knocked off her seat by lily over sized books ow lily sorry jen lily apologised can you take that up to the dorm for me please like i have a choice jenny muttered rubbing the sore spot on her arm where the bag had hit her thank you lily smiled at her friend as they left the common room i solemnly swear that i am up to no good james said tapping the map who first lily asked looks like your ex and a sixth year hufflepuff prefect are first tonight james said fourth floor behind the statue of wendelin the weird and taking lily arm the couple set off down the corridor fifteen minutes later resulted in twenty house points from each house and ethan swearing blue murder that he was going to get james at the quidditch match next week not meaning to sound over confident but that not going to happen james muttered as ethan swept away that sounds over confident to be honest lily remarked i have faith in my team james smiled checking the map and grinning even more who next lily asked just over here james said going over to the broom closet on the opposite wall and banging on the door padfoot tash time up kiddies lily stifled a giggle as a loud volley of swearing issued from within sirius stuck his head out of the door sorry we re busy you ll have to come back later out lily said in her firmest voice sirius pouted and walked out lily tash whined i dontinterrupt when you re snogging james what do you have to say for yourselves lily asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot we were celebrating sirius said celebrating what lily asked suspiciously you ll see if you go to the second floor and look at the ceiling tash grinned what are you james began let just say our dear friend bellatrix has a whole new view of life sirius winked come on tash we d better do what the head boy and girl say and before lily and james could ask they both disappeared up the stairs come on i want to see this james said taking lily hand and racing to the staircase to their disappointment however when they arrived at the second floor corridor they couldntfind bellatrix anywhere according to the map she was nowhere on the floor she must have got free james sighed in disappointment never mind lily said come on we ve still got half the school to check hey this is strange james frowned at the map looks like i ve found bellatrix fan club where are they lily asked one of the empty classrooms on the first floor james said and there are a couple of other people with them they hurried down to the next floor and to the classroom that the map indicated once there james threw the invisibility cloak over themselves just in case someone decided to come out and find them eavesdropping we ll ask once more snape voice appeared where are they we dontknow a shrill voice answered that the travis girls james whispered cassie and olivia their parents are aurors clarissa cousins lily asked james nodded and both of them fell silent to listen to the interrogation dontbe stupid girl they re your parents of course you know where they are avery snapped even if we did we wouldnttell you another voice almost identical to the first appeared that would be a very unwise choice snape said who wants to show her why maybe we should wait until bella gets here rudolphus hollow voice suggested she ll want a chance to practise there was a muffled squeak lily felt sympathy twist her heart james pulled her out of the way suddenly bellatrix appeared looking very flustered she hurried into the room giving lily a brief glimpse of inside the twins were tied against the wall surrounded by the slytherins all whom were wearing black cloaks and hoods the two ravenclaw girls were only second years so didntrecognise their captors voices bella where have you been snape asked getting down from the ceiling no thanks to my dear cousin and his mudblood girlfriend there was a long silence in which it was clear most of the death eaters were slightly surprised by bellatrix statement on three we go in james said i ll take the slytherins on the left you take the ones on the right lily nodded our little friends are reluctant to tell us what we want to know rudolphus said one james whispered now that not very nice is it bellatrix asked adopting her infamous baby voice which made lily grip her wand tighter two james said how about we use a more persuasive method snape suggested excellent suggestion bellatrix sneered three james hissed before flinging the door open lily stunned the two nearest to her which turned out to be snape and avery using a very powerful spell james had knocked the other three off their feet all of you back to your common room james ordered as bellatrix rudolphus and wilks got up off the floor before we call dumbledore oh they re going to get dumbledore rudolphus said sarcastically we re terrified you should be lily said because if he expels you you cantwatch us anymore and i can just imagine how happy voldemort would be when he found that out comment hitting home bellatrix snarled and swept out of the room followed by wilks and rudolphus who were dragging their fallen companions you two okay lily asked the twins slicing the ropes that bound them thank you lily cassie said i thought we d had it what did they want james asked they wanted to know where our parents were olivia said they said you know who wanted them dead she trailed off bottom lip trembling dontworry he wontget them james said you didnttell them where they were that took courage your parents will be proud you d better go back to your common room lily said they ve gone back to the dungeons so you should be fine what about you olivia asked we are going to find dumbledore james said its about time we stopped this a n wehey i done and i have to get up at five in

bugger off tomorrow morning now where my bottle of coke i tired chapter 30 the aftermath of the attack on the twins yielded no response from the teachers true to their word lily and james had gone straight to dumbledore with the news of the attack however the headmaster had said that without credible evidence there was nothing that could be done seething both head boy and girl had left with a horrible feeling of defeat hanging over them within a couple of weeks however something else took the place of worry over the slytherins with the upcoming quidditch final most of the gryffindors animosity was turned on the ravenclaws all whom seemed to have been whipped into hostile action by ethan roberts as captain and seeker of the team ethan was spoiling for a fight as the day of the match rolled around breakfast had an eerie air of silence surrounding it which lily had come to associate with dementors you could cut the tension in here with an axe she muttered as the post owls swooped in we canthelp it if your ex wants us dead lily jenny said looking remarkably like remus before a full moon i canteat a thing tash said pushing her bowl away into the path of a speeding owl which crashed and sprayed her with cornflakes and milk the ravenclaw team and a majority of the slytherin table laughed at her bloody bird tash complained magically drying her robes the owl gave an offended hoot and took off cuffing her round the head with its wing as it went who it for lily asked as tash promptly cursed all owls into the next millennium me jenny said picking up the letter and reading it mum wants to wish us all good luck she said we ll need more than luck to see us through this james muttered dontget any ideas james jenny warned we cantuse felix felicis in sports otherwise i would have drowned an entire cauldron of it already lily james lily turned around to see cassie and olivia beside the table receiving glares from the rest of their house alright james asked not really cassie said we know it the day of the match and everything but we just got the letters to lily horror both girls were carrying identical black letters and they didntneed three guesses to know who it was we re sorry lily said giving each of them a hug are you going to be okay we re going to go and speak to flitwick olivia said downcast we just though you should know after what happened the other week thanks for letting us know lily said flitwick should be in his office i haventseen him come down yet thanks both the twins walked off with their heads hung poor girls jenny said looking sadly at them wish it was the slytherins on the pitch sirius said i d relish kicking them right about now ooo and they re off mark shouted to the crowd lily immediately followed the quaffle which went straight into tash hands gryffindor with possession mark announced tearing up the pitch passes over to ericson sally dodging a bludger flips it back to marquand blocked by connor davis of ravenclaw that looked painful ravenclaw with possession nope nice bludger work there from black clarissa travis with possession she in the scoring zone with fallow up ahead she scores ten zero to gryffindor lily cheered with the rest of the scarlet supporters high above james was keeping his eyes peeled for the snitch he didntlike the looks that ethan was giving him and wanted to end the game before it could get nasty ravenclaw with possession mark continued joel lennard with the quaffle flanked by opposing chasers ouch that going to hurt in the morning bludger in the head maybe he ll stop spouting rubbish now joking professor gryffindor back in possession merlin that was quick gryffindor score silently cheering james scanned the pitch again nearby ethan was doing the same as play continued james was the first to notice the bludger hitting sally ericson down mark shouted to the roars of outrage from the gryffindors that was a nasty swing from norton gryffindor going to have to manage without one chaser well they managed fine in the last match gryffindor in possession out of the corner of his eye james noticed jenny smacking a bludger as hard as she could at the ravenclaw keeper he hit the ground and stayed there mathews is down mark shouted in surprise blimey where are they all going ethan let out a stream of violent swear words from his post near james james sniggered in a satisfied manner with the keeper now out of the way scoring became easier for tash and clarissa despite the fact they were one team mate down they scored again bringing the score to thirty ten watching ethan turn more and more purple by the minute was extremely satisfying for lily as well look at his face peter squeaked he cantbelieve it fantastic remus grinned james lily shouted james looked over quickly to see lily pointing to a spot near the ground to his surprise ethan had swooped down to talk to his beaters there was a nasty grin on his face and james realised that this could mean nothing good sure enough both beaters swooped up to the nearest bludger and smacked it as hard as they could at sirius who didntnotice until it was too late the gryffindors screamed as he hit the ground the bludger had knocked him clean off his broom jesus mark swore loudly there goes black and marquand is shouting at the ravenclaw captain what on earth is going on james knew exactly what was going on tash had obviously witnessed ethans hurried conversation with his beaters you foul cheating little bastard that was uncalled for lily screamed another warning too late as the same bludger slammed directly into tash face there was a sickening crack loud enough for the whole pitch to hear and tash joined sirius on the ground james signalled for a time out and hurried down to the ground even before the whistle was blown sirius was unconscious but appeared unharmed tash on the other hand was sporting a very bloody nose and was swearing shamelessly at ethan dat fucking biserable cheading son of a bidch she spluttered through thick blood down here james waved to the rest of the team jenny skidded to a halt and began trying to clean tash up sally james shouted sally ran over the side of her head bandaged from the bludger attack can you play sally nodded in determination right tash you and sirius are out james said tash immediately began shouting i b find she raved sounding as though she had a bad cold no you re not james cut her off sally you can cover for her jenny focus the bludger on ethan the sooner we can put him out the better play continued with both sides equally hampered by injury but with just two chasers one still mildly injured sally and clarissa were having trouble keeping hold of the quaffle long enough to score ravenclaw scored another goal bringing the score to thirty twenty panicking now james continued his frantic search for the snitch ethan however seemed to be waiting for james to spot it rather than look himself this also gave ethan the chance to shout instructions to his team mates as jenny swung her bat at the oncoming bludger ethan shot off suddenly and knocked her flying there was another angry roar from the crowd and madame hooch blew her whistle bloody hell mark swore these players are dropping like flies and that two penalties for gryffindor five minutes later and two penalties for gryffindor also meant that jenny too had been taken off the pitch nerves on edge james almost had his own nose broken by another on coming bludger the ravenclaw beaters seemed determined to get rid of all the gryffindor players there was another cheer from the crowd as ravenclaw scored again bringing the score level at this same moment james spotted it at last the snitch was hovering by the base of the gryffindor goal posts shooting off towards the end of the pitch ethan sped after him neck and neck both seekers raced towards the snitch the crowds had all stopped watching the chasers and were now screaming at their team mates catching his opponents movement james ducked just as ethans fist swung at his head the ravenclaw overbalanced and fell the few feet to the ground leaving james way clear to the snitch the cheer from the crowd was enough to raise the dead the gryffindor supporters spilled on to the pitch james immediately spotted lily and half pulled her onto his broom in a hug from the edge of the pitch all the injured players were returning jenny and sirius were both awake and tash nose had been repaired we won the cup jenny squeaked as lily and james made their way over to them everyone around them was seized in a massive hug and for once no one protested we won jen repeated once she had released everyone established jen lily said happily cheater came a yell from the other end of the pitch ethan was surrounded by his team mates i canthelp it if you lost your sense of balance roberts james said evenly if you hadntmoved i would never had fallen ethan fumed storming up to the gryffindors back off ethan tash yelled you re just jealous that you lost not surprising though since they have you as captain shut your mouth marquand another player snapped sod you jenny joined in leave it guys lily said she didntwant a fight to start especially when they had just won the cup break it up madam hooch interrupted come on lily pulled james away before he could start anything you haventheard the last of

refuge in the library for peace and quiet the boys had all disappeared off somewhere which the girls had decided not to ask about you ll be fine jen tash said pulling out her copy of beginners guide to auror training oh this is pointless i cantjust study a book i need a moving target i sure we could make the slytherins stand still long enough for you to jinx them lily said come on it late we d better get back to the common room they hurried up the staircase to the common room lily couldnthelp noticing how few students were around everyone seemed quite content to stay in their common room or the library and study hey jenny said suddenly whipping out her wand tash and lily did the same just as jenny shouted impedimenta looking at what had frozen lily saw a dirty grey rat which jen was now hovering in midair peter lily said in recognition tash waved her wand and there was a flash of light peter pettigrew appeared suspended in midair what the hell are you doing here lily asked nothing peter said turning red from all the blood rushing to his head were you following us tash asked no peter spluttered who ordered you to follow us lily asked ignoring his last response no one peter squeaked i ll bet it was the boys jenny said he does anything they tell him to no it wasntthem peter said urgently but the girls were paying no attention i think we need to go and see our boyfriends

boys in the common room they had decided to search the dorm nothing tash said they arenthere it ten o clock where else could they be jen asked in frustration what about the map lily asked good idea

the school appearing location location found them uh oh they re on their way back to the common room we d better get out of here before they find us snooping around tash said lily hurried to replace the map where they had found it hey guys look at this she said pulling out a photograph of the boys taken in their fifth year all four of them were waving at the camera aww jenny cooed looking at the photo still as cute as ever pity we didntthink so back then tash said hey lily remember that time after our exams when you shouted at james by the lake you said you d rather go out with the giant squid mmm lily nodded remember on the train when you threatened to cut of sirius arm and reattach it to his arse point taken tash nodded you two are hopeless jenny said shaking her head hey so were you lily pointed out it took you three years to pluck up the courage to ask remus out visitors all three girls looked up to see james sirius and remus standing in the doorway we didntdo anything tash said stupidly making everyone laugh we were looking for you lily said getting back onto the subject they had originally intended did you ask peter to follow us no why james asked frowning because we caught him trailing us just outside the library jenny said well we didnttell him to follow you sirius said hey maybe he has a crush on one of you okay that not even funny jenny said as all three boys chuckled mmm wonder why he was following us then tash said frowning and going into deep thought which lily interrupted with a cough anyway where were you lot she asked we looked everywhere dontyou worry about that lily james said we just thought we would take our creativity out on our dear friends in slytherin right just stop right there lily said we dontwant to know what you did to them i do tash squeaked you ll see tomorrow sirius promised now who wants to tell us why you were sneaking around up here and why is my trunk in a mess james asked pointing at the jumble of clothes at the end of his bed ah jenny trailed off trying not to look conspicuous run for your lives tash shouted and all three girls barged past the boys and hurried down the stairs giggling hysterically none of them noticed on the map that right at that minute peter was meeting with the slytherins ooo three down two to go lily muttered to herself how was herbology jen remus asked terrible jenny said wringing her hands i sure it went fine lily said looking at tash to add her share of praise tash however was not listening stupefy she shouted there was a thud behind the group behind them in the corridor lay ethan roberts unconscious on the floor he was going to hex you james tash said casually he been following us all day nice stunner sirius said come on before a teacher gets here lily said ushering everyone away who going to hogsmeade on the last week of term tash asked we are jenny said we re not going to miss our last time in the village as students james said smiling as he said it who wants to meet up for lunch tash asked okay as long as i not paying sirius said you never pay for anything james reminded his friend i do sirius said indignantly lily laughed but her mind was caught up in the thought of finishing school in a few weeks ooo step away from your cauldrons the exam is over professormarchbanks said lily sighed along with the rest of the class she had a nice feeling in her stomach that the exam had gone well you may leave that it jenny squeaked as they left that went so badly tash said holding her head in her hands it looked fine from where i was standing lily said in comfort no i sure i wait a minute tash said frowning how could you have seen i was behind you umm lily stalled for an answer she had of course not seen tash potion she was trying to offer comfort who wants to go and sit outside remus hastily changed the subject sounds good to me james agreed steering lily away from tash who was still trying to figure out how on earth lily could have seen her potion when she was three desks behind her is anyone else scared jenny asked when they were sitting outside under the tree by the lake scared of what lily asked this jenny said lifting her arms and gesturing to the grounds around them leaving school we re never going to come back dontbe daft we ll come back tash said we didntspend seven years living at this castle just to forget about it we ve got too many memories of this place james said what your favourite memory lily asked the day i first saw you lily james said smiling at her aww jenny cooed my favourite is september 1st during our first year at school when we all met on the train we were all in the same compartment i remember lily said smiling i found tash on her own first i was so pleased to find someone who didntcome from the magical world then jenny came in because all the compartments were full tash said you looked a little lost jen i think we all looked lost jenny said my favourite is the valentines ball tash smiled that was fun except for our death eater chase at the end lily reminded them are you kidding that was fun tash said my favourite was the day we both had detention in the trophy room sirius chimed in giving tash a fleeting grin and we all know why that it lily muttered remembering how she and james had walked in on them but every single quidditch match comes in second sirius added i loved all of it remus said i was just happy to get into school in the first place and we re glad you did jenny put in what about you lily tash asked what your favourite memory been lily thought for a minute before coming up with an answer i think right now this is my favourite memory what us all sitting here without a care in the world sirius asked yep lily nodded i mean look at us no exams no slytherins in sight and no worries at all i can see where you re coming from jen nodded wish i had a camera to capture it tash complained as long as we remember it lily said that all that matters a n we re into the

like arguing with her so they all set off into the sweet shop emerging fifteen minutes later with everyone laughing at tash and sirius who were having a contest to see who could blow the biggest bubbles with their gum i win sirius cheered tash pouted what do i get for that sirius asked how about a hug jenny offered enthusiastic as she always was at the prospect of hugging someone no thank you

james frowned they re not usually closed especially on a weekend when the students are allowed down here lily frowned and looked at everyone else faces everyone was looking curious eh well sirius shrugged where shall we go next carpe retractum a thin gold ribbon shot out of the alley by the side of the shop and wrapped itself around tash wrist she gave a yelp as it dragged her out of sight what the bloody hell come on lily said pulling out her wand and running into the alley there were three flashes of light and sirius jenny and james fell to the ground no lily cried running to james

she fell into darkness ooo lily lily get up we ve been kidnapped keep it down damn it lily awoke to find james bending over her looking worried where are we lily asked no idea james said hugging her

educated guess james said educated jenny asked i d bet anything in the world without an education tash sirius said shaking his girlfriend only to receive a weak punch in the face dontwant to go to school today she mumbled get up jenny screamed at her shh remus hissed pulling sirius upright jesus i dating a violent woman where are we tash asked reaching for her wand only to find it wasntthere where the hell is my wand she freaked lily and jenny automatically checked their own pockets only to find them empty they re in here remus said i came round just as they were taking them he was pointing to a desk in the corner of the room taking a good look around lily could see that they were in a bedroom which looked like it belonged to a girl the wall paper was flowery with an inch of dust covering the pink carpet the draw locked james said examining the desk here sirius said striding up to the desk and feeling in his pocket damn they ve taken it tash have you got yours what are they talking about jenny asked no one in particular got it tash said pulling out a pen knife birthday present from sirius she said running the blade of the knife in the crack of the draw it clicked

open the draw voila grinning now lily took her wand back very glad to see it again okay we are armed now we have to get out of here james said alohamora lily pointed her wand at the door it remained shut the knife lily said sirius came forwards with his own knife and the door clicked right who first he asked not me jenny said i ll go james sighed wrenching open the door everyone made to follow when james stopped in the doorway causing everyone to slam into each other ouch jenny complained as a jet of red light hit the door frame and james slammed the door shut again and locked it right not going out that way he said hurrying to the window why lily asked it full of death eaters james said how many sirius asked about twenty give or take james said peering out of the window woah we re two stories up and no other exits remus said looking around the room there was a bang outside and the door shuddered that spell wontlast forever james said we need a way out of here and fast alohomora a

reviewers enjoy my action packed chapter chapter 33 everyone fell through the hole and landed in the room below reparo lily shouted the hole in the ceiling disappeared everyone okay lily asked well we could use some warning next time tash muttered that gratitude for you lily complained picking herself up good thinking lily james said looking around the room looks like we re back in a bedroom everyone looked around and sure enough they were back in another bedroom i ll bet this is the house of a family they killed sirius said you re right remus turned around holding a photograph he had found on the nightstand waving from the frame was a man a woman and two identical girls hang on jen said isntthat cassie and olivia travis lily whispered this must have been their house now it a death eater hideout remus finished grimly how do we get out of here tash asked without getting spotted james said with difficulty i say we get off this floor before they find us he hurried to the door and opened it slowly empty come on shivering with nerves lily crept after him wondering how on earth they were going to get out of this alive the group came out on the landing and looked around the house was showing signs of neglect after almost two months of disuse dust had settled on the floor and the windows were boarded up probably by the aurors after they had left there was a drip from the ceiling coming from the leaky pipe above their heads remind you of the shrieking shack sirius asked as they went down the stairs it does actually remus said glancing around at the house ow lily cried out as she put her foot through the bottom stair the wood was starting to rot through due to the dripping water from above tash and jenny seized her arms and pulled her up bit like the trick stairs at school james remarked this must be the ground floor then that must be the basement you almost put your foot through lils jenny smiled guys tash swallowed you dontthink voldemort in here possibly james said peering around the hallway as though expecting voldemort to jump out from behind the staircase be careful he supposed to be a skilled occlumens well maybe if we all think nasty thoughts he ll die of shock jenny suggested jen that not funny lily said yes it is tash laughed seriously its not james said doors locked remus said going over to check the front door suppose they re apperating in jenny suggested they cantbe james shook his head i tried to apperate before we woke you all up they must have a jinx on the house floo powder sirius suggested it must be magical they wouldntwant people just to stroll up to the front door or for the captives to stroll out lily pointed out nodding at the door how about the basement remus suggested locked tash said trying the handle and then her knife melted i dontknow what they did to that door but it melted the blade she looked sadly at the knife before replacing it in her pocket what about the hole that lily made sirius suggested could we get in through there maybe james ran to the stairs and peered through the hole if we make it bigger and before anyone could add anything there was an ear splitting bang and the bottom three stairs disappeared hurry someone will have heard that james said lily climbed down first and landed on concrete come on down she said looking around the basement it was stacked high with boxes filled with old clothes and toys jenny landed next to her hey there a window she said running over to check just as tash jumped down can you open it lily asked jenny was climbing boxes to get to the window which was near the ceiling allowing light to stream in sirius jumped through the hole next what are we looking at he asked the window lily said if the door was locked then maybe they haventbeen down here that spell on the door must have been put on by the family so nothing down here will be locked up tash said as jenny pushed the small window open can one of you get through that sirius asked why cantwe just blast it tash asked if we blow the wall chances are the ceiling will come down on our heads lily pointed out before anyone could try tash suggestion i too big tash said examining the window james and remus appeared and joined them at the stack of boxes jenny could get through that lily said no way i not leaving you here jenny protested it either that or we all stay here and die lily retorted if you get out you can go and get help i dontcare i not leaving you all jenny said stubbornly i wontrun away and leave my friends in danger you have to lily said there was a silence in the room jenny either you go and we stand a chance of getting out of here remus said or we all stay here and wait for them to find us do you really think if they find us we stand a chance of surviving jenny looked at each of them in turn then sighed in defeat alright she said someone needs to hold the window open for me as soon as you re clear of the house apperate back to hogsmeade james said its four thirty so the shops will still be open go to honeydukes there a secret passage in the basement i know remus showed me a while ago jenny said you ll get back to hogwarts quicker that way james finished tash hold the window for me jenny said lily and tash gave their friend a hug before helping her out the window i never thought i d see daylight again jenny muttered before bending down so she could speak to everyone i ll be back as soon as i can she promised before running away from the house if anything happens to her i ll never forgive myself lily said as jenny turned on the spot and disapperated me too tash nodded her head come on we d better try and find our own way out of here james said take it we arentgetting back through our hole sirius said looking at the hole they had fashioned in the ceiling you got a ladder lily asked dryly before anyone could add further comment or suggestion there was a bang and the door was blown off its hinges everyone backed away against the wall think they found us tash said state the ob lily began advada kedavra shouted one of the death eaters lily and tash flung themselves behind the nearest stack of boxes as the curse hit the wall behind them invocatum lily heard james shout tash jumped up and began firing hexes left right and centre getting up lily did the same dodging as another killing curse was fired impedimenta lily shouted the nearest death eater froze and lily knocked him into the nearest pile of boxes protego remus cried a shield burst out of his wand covering all five of them from a barrage of stunning spells that had been fired lunaresca tash yelled a bright beam of light shot out of her wand and several death eaters dropped to the floor comaxa a death eater with an oily voice stepped forwards lily pulled tash to the floor missing the curse by inches cheers tash said quickly before disarming their attacker lily followed with a stunning spell the death eaters hood slipped off lily didntrecognise the face but the voice that she had heard a second ago held recognition it was lucius malfoy lunaresca tash shouted desperately again three more death eaters were caught in her spell there was a flash of light and lily gasped as tash dropped to the floor unconscious lily wanted to help her but the killing curse that another death eater had fired brought her back thinking quickly she summoned the nearest box which caught the curse tash sirius shouted and lily could see him running over to her lily quickly performed a shield charm to stop anyone trying to hex him as she did something hit her in the back lily looked around to see that something was lifting her off the ground one of the death eaters had caught her in a manipulation spell she was now about a foot off the floor and was paralyzed with fear as one all the death eaters stopped firing at them james sirius and remus were all keeping a tight grip on their wands james was watching lily with one eye wondering which death eater had her caught one of the figures came forwards from the rest and a new sensation of fear gripped lily as tight as the spell which held her it wasnta death eater who had caught her the face sneering up at her was that of lord voldemort a n yay it the man who failed to kill the boy who lived not once but five bloody times sorry this is what me and my friends call voldemort arentyou all so happy i ve got

chapter 34 how does it feel to be caught up in my net mudblood voldemort sneered at lily who was summoning up all her courage and scowling right back at him let her go james yelled the death eaters all laughed at him lily shivered that kind of laughter was not one that made her feel particularly great where the other girl voldemort asked looking around at the five teenagers what you just noticed she wasnthere sirius said sarcastically shut up black one of the death eaters snarled why did you kidnap us remus asked with the air of a hasty distraction six of the most talented young witches and wizards ever voldemort hissed potentially valuable allies slaves you mean sirius broke in scornfully dontinterrupt another of the death eaters snapped sending a jet of white light at sirius he hit the floor unconscious disappointing voldemort said i had expected more from a black he turned back to james and remus his red eyes flashing sinisterly join me and you could become more powerful than you are now no way lily spat from her place just below the ceiling i wasntasking you mudblood voldemort snarled dontcall her that james yelled a stunning spell leapt from his wand voldemort deflected it lazily how touching he sneered but now i starting to grow impatient join me and i might just let you live never in a million years remus stated and i speaking for jenny tash and sirius the last mistake of your life lupin voldemort promised potter i d rather die than join you james said above their heads lily was nodding in agreement voldemort looked furious lily doubted anyone had ever had the courage to turn him down before so be it he pointed his wand at lily but before anything could happen another voice cut in verdimillious there was a jet of pale green light and voldemort gave an inhuman scream lily fell out of the air and landed dizzily on the floor bite that lily looked around to see tash still lying on the floor wand raised and a smug grin plastered on her face voldemort rounded on the group his red eyes full of fury avada kedavra accio yelled lily a stack of boxes in the corner of the room toppled as lily summoned one from the bottom row there was a bang as the killing curse hit one feathers flew everywhere in the confusion lily james and remus began to duel the death eaters tash crawled over to sirius and began trying to revive him luneresca james pointed his wand at three of the death eaters and they were instantly knocked out lily pulled him down as another killing curse soared over them stand aside voldemort voice cut through the feathers avada kedavra just before the curse struck another box flew through the room this time directed by remus there was another bang and this time old copies of the daily prophet exploded all over the room fuming now voldemort flung another hex at the three teenagers who all began summoning boxes to block the spells family possessions began exploding everywhere a box full of old trinkets was next to take a hit releasing a cloud of purple smoke everyone coughed and spluttered he cantkeep up forever james told lily between coughs the killing curse takes energy if we can keep him at bay till he gets tired then we ll have a better chance lily nodded as the cloud began to clear taking advantage of the confusion remus was hexing the death eaters a stunning spell flew over his shoulder and hit tash who was still trying to bring sirius round tash lily yelped she ll be fine james said summoning another box into the path of the next killing curse voldemort gave a snarl of fury and tried again this time however the spell died before it could reach them the dark lords energy was depleting completely fuming now voldemort sent another curse towards the group what exactly is this achieving remus asked over the noise of another three boxes and their artefacts ripping to pieces buying us some time till jen gets back james said quickly pulling both lily and remus out of the path of another spell a stack of boxes behind the group exploded potion bottles shattered against the floor evanesco lily yelled some of the potion mixtures disappeared james was continuing to hex the death eaters until a scream from behind took their attention remus was drenched in potion the colour of molten metal his hands and face were blistering james was frantically trying to vanish the mess but the damage was done what happening lily asked silver james said it had silver in it very interesting isntit voldemort asked the werewolf allergy to a simple metal lily glared at voldemort hoping that maybe looks would start to kill now i must say i impressed the three of you have lasted this long the dark lord said his eyes flicking briefly over sirius and tash say goodbye to your friends he raised his wand lily gripped james hand there was a bang above their heads and the ceiling caved in by the stairs the death eaters and voldemort swung round to find aurors swarming into the room leading them and looking extremely murderous to match was jenny lay a wand on my friends and you are so past tense she yelled before flinging hexes left right and centre there were a series of loud cracks as the death eaters outnumbered fled voldemort yelled in fury and lily took this opportunity to fire another curse at him the dark lord blocked it and disapperated where d that little son of a jenny fumed before noticing her boyfriend oh my god the fight ended abruptly as the rest of the death eaters disapperated lily flopped onto the ground as the aurors crowded round jenny was making frantic attempts to wake remus up what happened she squeaked looking at lily silver lily said weakly jenny screamed though this may have been due to the fact that she spotted tash and sirius lying unconscious beside them lily felt the world tilt hideously through exhaustion lily are you okay james asked sitting beside her as the aurors attended to remus tired lily muttered you were brilliant no i wasn t i was panicking james said i was worried about you he wrapped his arms around her and lily drifted off into unconsciousness a n ugh i struggled with that chapter so dontbe too hard on me if it was a little

obsessive urge to make sure they were all okay it was just past midnight yeah you go to sleep jen lily nodded you ran all the way up to the castle to get help you must be exhausted tash has already clocked out she pointed at tash who had fallen asleep curled up in sirius arms but what if jenny began we ll wake you up if there is any change lily promised jenny gave a weak smile and flopped to sleep next to remus she must have been tired lily said running all that way and it canthave been easy to apperate being that panicky what about you james asked voldemort caught you werentyou scared a little lily said but i wasntabout to let him know that i dontknow what i would have done if i d lost you james whispered wrapping his arms around lily shoulders i would have died right there and then lily smiled and placed a long kiss on his lips oi cantyou two exercise any self control lily and james turned around to see tash and sirius smirking at them mmm so the way you two are sleeping together is totally innocent then is it james teased a couple of rude hand gestures replied cantsleep tash asked watching over jen lily nodded she finally out knew she d sleep eventually sirius said did you see her when she charged into the room with the aurors if looks could kill voldemort would be six feet under by now wish looks could kill it would make the job a lot easier lily muttered sitting down on her own bed uh oh lily becoming homicidal tash warned backing away from lily and succeeding in falling off her bed jenny hey moony awake sirius cheered everyone crowded around the bed as remus began to stir jen wake your lazy arse up tash ordered huh jenny asked looking around in a daze wha remus you re awake guess so remus said sitting up slowly jenny threw her arms around him smacking tash in the face as she went now that is a lack of self control sirius said nodding at jen and remus who were now engaged in a passionate kiss for lack of anything better to do james decided to kiss lily i didntthink that was a cue sirius said looking a little put out eh so what tash asked pulling him forward to kiss him as well really now everyone broke away as madame pomfrey came out of her office wearing a pink dressing gown and matching slippers this is a hospital wing and i will not have it turning into a room of runaway teenage hormones lily and jenny giggled madame pomfrey began checking over remus upon seeing that he was awake well there should be no lasting damage thank heaven for that at the very least she muttered sirius yawned and the nurse frowned shouldntyou all be in bed she asked do we have to jenny asked yes you do miss tailby and you shouldnteven be here madame pomfrey reminded her what jenny squeaked i ran for half an hour straight i might still be in danger of having an asthma attack i sure you are no longer in danger madame pomfrey replied curtly now off to bed jenny groaned and stomped out of the hospital wing waving to everyone as she left she going to be cranky tomorrow lily sighed getting back into her own bed night everyone tash yawned lily sighed and drifted off to an uneasy sleep ooo there was a flash of green light james face swam before her she screamed but no one could hear lily lily snapped awake she was lying in bed in the hospital wing four pairs of anxious eyes were looking at her just a nightmare lily said i fine sure james asked sure lily nodded james wrapped his arms around her and pretty soon they were all engaged in a hug which would have put jenny to shame ooo somebody been sleeping in my bed james said as lily woke up the next morning she blinked at her surroundings actually i think someone is sleeping in my bed lily said poking james in the side somebody been sleeping in my bed sirius said in a childish voice well i sorry but it was a million degrees in the dormitory jen lily asked sitting up as best she could she found her five friends squashed uncomfortably on her bed they had all fallen asleep after the hug what are you doing here lily asked like i said jen replied a million degrees in the dormitory you lot were fast asleep when i got here and having five people crammed onto one bed looked like fun so i decided to see if there was room for a sixth person yes we re going for the world record james said the most number of people sleeping on a single bed without falling off someone coughed loudly everyone looked around to see professor dumbledore standing by the door smiling in amusement at them something poking me in the side jenny said i think that my elbow sirius said sorry jen good morning dumbledore said cheerfully i trust you all had a pleasant sleep not really remus said someone here is really bony i think that tash lily said i choose to take that as a compliment tash said and in any case i very comfortable course you are you got the most mattress james complained actually i take that back jenny took up the most mattress are you calling me fat potter jenny asked in a dangerous voice everyone cringed no james said fearfully okay then good morning professor jenny fanatic smile reappeared and she beamed at the headmaster good morning miss tailby i hope everyone had a refreshing sleep after yesterday events not really remus repeated getting off the bed incidentally james asked what is the world record for the largest number of people on a bed thirteen dumbledore provided the six students looked at each other we need more people jenny summarised well putting the record aside lily said feeling that the conversation was getting a little too silly for words good morning professor good morning dumbledore repeated i was hoping i could ask you what happened yesterday stopping only to receive medicine from madame pomfrey half way through the six students explained the events of the previous day with varying degrees of accuracy due to the number of times that they had each been knocked unconscious all that happened while i was gone jenny asked yep lily nodded good god jenny muttered i sorry i left you all in such danger dontbe daft jen you charged right back in with about twenty aurors tash pointed out and you had the scariest look on your face i ve ever seen really jenny asked looking at the guys for conformation they all nodded in agreement cool i scare death eaters jenny smiled taking three grapes from the fruit bowl for her breakfast yes well moving swiftly on james said has the daily prophet got hold of the story yet the ministry is keeping it as quiet as possible dumbledore assured them i give them a week before they find out tash said you re on sirius assured her in fact the only people who are aware of your kidnapping yesterday are the teachers and your parents dumbledore listed mum going to kill me for getting into danger like that jenny muttered well i think that is everything dumbledore said helping himself to a grape as he stood up from the bed the end of year feast is tomorrow i hope to see everyone there you will james assured the headmaster course you will its your last day of free food jenny reminded them i cantimagine you three she pointed at james sirius and tash missing free food her answer was three pillows in her face jenny landed on the floor giggling insanely lily and remus shrugged and joined in as he left the room dumbledore smiled at six of the most talented students ever to pass through the school who were currently engaged in a frantic pillow fight he knew they were very special people and they were going to make their mark in the wizarding world a n one more to go then i going to brush up a few of my other stories and i going to post something on fictionpress then the sequel to this story will magically appear in a cloud of stardust in background muses throw glitter over mei head so prettyfull next chapter the end of year feast may stardust fall in your dreams disclaimer after seven months of begging i still dontown it poor deprived me a n nothing to say muses well there a first except read authors note at the bottom chapter 36 come on lily it the feast not world war three no jen world war three would be me i on my way lily yelled falling down the stairs two at a time where are the guys she asked they went down ahead of us tash said i think they re planning something for our last day this cantbe good lily said hope they dontspoil it they d never do that on our last day jenny rolled her eyes how insensitive do you think they are we re going to be safe and pretend you didntsay that tash said they entered the hall and sat down in their usual places the four boys were already there shovelling food as if it was their last day on earth wild horses couldntkeep you lot away from food lily shook her head and helped herself to pork chops pass the mash please lily tash asked holding her hands out for the bowl so now you lot are going to auror training crystel said are you going to move into london maybe lily shrugged not at first i think i ll stay at home for a bit i dontneed to move tash grinned i live close enough to london to get there easily every day has jenny told you crystel asked we re going to get a flat together y know since we re both training to be healers yeah she said lily nodded grinning at jenny who was making a sculpture out of her potatoes and her beans jenny lily raised an eyebrow at her food what this is the last day i get to be childish and get away with it scott free jenny said excellent approach jen sirius said breaking away from his food you re growing up wish you would tash muttered elbowing sirius in the side incidentally why did you all rush down here without us it a surprise james said a nice surprise or one that going to make us want to kill you jenny asked you ll just have to see remus smiled uh oh lily said thinking that this could mean nothing good you re not going to dangle the slytherins upside down into their food again are you no james shook his head although that is a good idea why didntwe think of that throughout the rest of the meal the boys kept breaking into silent whispers and by the time it came to dumbledore announcing the house cup winners lily was becoming slightly nervous at the fact that they kept shooting each other maniacal grins gryffindor wins the house cup dumbledore announced the table exploded into cheers this seemed to be the cue that the marauders had been waiting for there were several loud bangs and fireworks exploded around the room the students all laughed and some of the teachers looked disapprovingly at the display dumbledore however was chuckling and tipped his pointed hat to the four boys who were soaking up their last moments of glory in the school ooo wow lily remarked looking around the empty dormitory it looks so bare has the carpet always been red jenny asked frowning at the massive scarlet carpet beneath their feet yeah it always been red crystel assured her covered in clothes but still red except that time in the fourth year when you decided to change it to bright green jen lily reminded her oh yeah jenny smiled why did we change it back because mcgonagall found out and threatened to put us in slytherin since we like the colour so much tash said god no jenny shuddered still tash said looking around it looks weird to see it so clean hate to say it though lily said but the guys dorms were tidier tash and jen nodded in agreement gonna miss this place crystel said us too jenny nodded had some good times here like when we went to egg the guys dorm crystel grinned yeah lily smiled and when we went to paint the guys noses red at christmas in our fourth year tash said yeah lily nodded and when we stayed up for all those little chats after hours jenny added mhmm lily agreed we ve won the house cup and the quidditch cup again tash smiled we ve hexed the slytherins in defence against the dark arts jenny said we ve pranked them even more tash said we ve run into death eaters loads of times lily said and voldemort once tash added jenny has achieved what she wanted since her third year lily said she dating remus tash has achieved what she always wanted jenny said she got into auror academy we ve eaten loads of chocolate tash grinned we ve had loads of hugs from jenny lily said and lots of songs from tash jenny said lily been head girl and risen to the challenge brilliantly tash nodded at lily you three have found true love crystel smiled at them and amazingly after all this jenny said we re all still friends i guess we haventalways been the most sensible and rule abiding students lily shrugged yeah but at least we never got caught like the guys did tash pointed out not that that hard jenny shrugged everyone nodded in agreement lily stared around at the room which had been her home for the past seven years three thirty jenny said looking at her watch we d better go lily nodded and picked up her trunk it seemed heavier as though it didntwant to leave the school either crystel was already out of the door with tash and jen not far behind sighing lily hauled her trunk to the door and took one last look at the dorm before closing the door and following her friends a n wow that it its finished i
