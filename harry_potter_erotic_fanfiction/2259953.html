there own well i hope that this story will answer those questions and show what harry life would have been like if he had been raised in a household full of love thank you for reading my faithful readers and i hope that this story will brighten your day unlike most of my stories i will not be having harry and ginny hook up for one because she will be his adopted sister and for another in this reality that would be wrong please enjoy the story donald arthur i going to go visit the potters for awhile can you watch ron and the twins while i out i should be back in a couple of hours molly weasley was in her 9th month with her 7th child she was hoping that this time she would have a daughter but wasntholding her hopes up she had been friends with lily potter for a couple of years now and her son ron and harry were playmates she was going to visit them tonight so that she could see harry halloween costume and to visit lily before she had her baby anytime soon she heard her husband say a reply in the positive before she went to the fireplace to floo to godric hollow where the potters were in hiding she wasntable to get to there house exactly but only had a short walk from the town proper to there dwelling she was bundled up warm for the weather and hoped that everything was ok when she stepped out of the floo in the small wizarding tavern in town she nodded hello to the friendly barkeep as she headed for the door she was walking at a leisurely pace towards the potters house and decided to stop by a little store that had a few cute little teddy bears in the window she went in and picked up 5 of them one for each of her babies and the one coming and one for harry after she paid for her purchases she headed on her way again with her packages in her pocket shrunk she was getting a little bit nervous as she approached the little house and especially when she saw the mark in the air oh my god it cantbe how did he find them she ran as fast as she could to the house knowing that there wasntanything that she could do she knew what the dark mark in the sky meant and was hoping that for some reason that she could help when she got to the potters house she walked in through the door and saw james potter dead on the living room floor with his wand still in his hand it looked like it had been an intense battle but he wasntable to do anything about the killing curse lily are you still here she went looking around the house hoping that lily potter was able to get out of the house with little harry before the dark lord was able to find them she had a foreboding feeling about it tho as she saw no one else down stairs she made her way upstairs and as she was looking around she found lily in the nursery along with another body what happened here who is this other person molly was about to look over the dead body of the stranger in black when she heard the soft crying of a baby she ran over to the crib hoping beyond hope that she would find harry potter alive when she looked down into the crib she saw something that made her heart leap harry potter was sitting there crying but alive she picked him up and started soothing him as she heard popping coming from downstairs she went downstairs to see who was the first to arrive albus i so glad to see you molly was crying almost as much as harry was molly what are you doing here what happened here albus dumbledore was shocked to say the least when he found james potter dead in the living room but to see molly weasley walk downstairs with a baby in her arms he was a little happy happy to find one of the potters alive at least please tell me that you and lily were out when this happened and you came back to find it like this please molly please tell me that dumbledore was pleading with the lady when she just shook her head i sorry albus i came to visit to see harry halloween costume for tonight i came in too late and they were already gone when i got here the funny thing is i found little harry here crying in his crib and a strange man in his nursery dead along with his mother who would it be that was here there was a twinkle in his eye when he heard this that my dear molly was lord voldemort and it seems that young mr potter here has started the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy come now molly i will take him someplace that is safe for him to be raised he will be raised with his muggle family you will not albus i dontknow what happened here but i will not let you take him to live with his muggle relatives lily never liked her sister and her husband despises everything magic arthur and i will take him in and raise him as our own we will adopt harry potter and make him our 7th or 8th son depends on what this little one will come out as there is no arguing with me albus and you know it molly was cradling little harry in her arms and cooing to him dontworry harry you donthave to go to your aunt and uncle house to live you will have a big happy family to live with harry looked up at her with those deep emerald eyes and she fell in love if you have a problem about this there is something you should know lily and james had named me as his godmother and it is my right to raise him albus dumbledore just sighed and relented ok molly you will probably be the best for him if your going to do this i need to let you know what the prophecy says so you can tell him when he gets old enough to understand what going on and what he has to do i sure with your family love and support he will be able to handle this before he goes to hogwart with your youngest son ronald this is the prophecy that was told to me by sybil trelawney many years ago some might think her a fraud but she does have true sight sometimes it goes like this the prophecy taken from the book harry potter and the order of the phoenix page 841 the one with the power to defeat the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies well what do you think molly that is one of the only prophecies that she has ever made and i trust that it true so you see harry has been marked and been made the one that the prophecy speaks of dumbledore had a sparkle in his eyes as he said this do you still want to take him in as one of your own please think about this hard molly this will put your family in more danger than before yes albus i sure that we want to take him in as one of our own i know that it will be hard but he cantgo and live with those muggles so albus dumbledore handed young harry potter to molly weasley and she took some of his things and flooed back to the burrow she told her husband what happened and that they were going to take harry in as their own to raise for the potters arthur weasley was more than willing to take in another little one into their family he also knew the potters and thought it would be great to raise him so harold james potter came to be raised as an weasley he became harold james weasley the youngest son to the weasleys november 1st 1981 found molly weasley going into labor with there 7th born child and had her at around noon that day ginevra molly weasley was born as the only daughter to arthur and molly weasley the day after lily and james potter were killed on halloween in 1981 harry was raised in the loving family of the weasley and he was told all about his parents when they thought he would be old enough to understand he understood that he was brought in by the weasley s and was excited watching his older brothers going to hogwarts he couldntwait for the day when he would join them as well a n ok everyone i hope that you liked this story the next chapter will be when harry get his hogwart letter and goes to diagon alley to get his supplies this chapter will also have the first train ride and the sorting feast this story probably is going to be a long one and go through harry seventh year thank

through the floo network and landed in the living room with a thud and shouts of move out of the way while ron helped luna out of the way of the fireplace they watched and laughed as they saw the rest of the group come flying out of the fire floo first came draco and pansy then neville and ginny and then came dawn and seamus dudley and pavartti padma and blaise fred george james lily remus sirius fleur and finally bill they all dusted themselves off and then went to find mr and mrs weasley in the kitchen waiting for them with dinner on the table after dinner they were all sitting around the living room talking about what they were going to be doing this summer they were talking about learning about different types of quidditch moves doing homework having fun swimming going to the movies in the village of ottery st catchpole they were also talking about what their other friends and family were doing at this time and wondering if they were having a good time ginny said that they should send them a letter to them telling them that they made it home in good health and having a good time but still missing them they all agreed and sent a letter out with pig after the first week they got a letter back rather quickly and were surprised by some of the news that they had received the letter was addressed to all of them and ron sat down and addressed the assembled friends and family well we just got a letter from harry and hermione letting us know how their summer was going so far and since it is addressed to all of us i thought that i would read it ron smiled and knew that there was a few things that he would leave out and tell some of the friends but not the adults later dear friends and family we have arrived at our destination quite nicely and found that we are to be spending the summer at the grangers summer estate which is on 400 acres in the english countryside ron leaves out the next part about them spending a couple of weeks alone just supervised by a pregnant tonks once or twice a week we are looking forward to seeing you all over harry birthday we were thinking about inviting you all to the place for his birthday and you all can see the lake and the countryside we have met some nice elves that have taken up residence in the forest on the land and have become friends with their tribe we also have all kind of magical creatures around the land and you all will love coming and seeing it all hopefully you all can come and stay for the rest of the summer from harry birthday on or at least stay for a couple of days all our love harry and hermione sounds like they are having fun and it would be fun to check out the country side everyonce and a while ron said this and then looked at his older brother charley with a questioning gaze charley looked at his younger brother wondering what he was looking at then remembered that tonks was going to be doing and it dawned on him that they hadnttold the family about tonks pregnancy yet well i have an announcement everyone tonks and i are expecting twins in about 2 months sorry we haventtold you before but we were keeping it quiet from everyone he looked sheepish at his family and smiled as they all cheered and congratulated him and tonks tonks wasntthere but charley said he would let her know and that she was off on a light assignment to help a friend he knew that harry and hermione didntwant the family to worry about them being alone for two weeks pretty much and he also knew from experience last summer that they were responsible and wouldntdo anything foolish he also knew that just in case they decided to act on their feelings for each other that they were prepared for it and wouldntend up in the same condition that he and his wife were in at this time bill stood up and addressed the crowd also i know that fleur and i have only been seeing each other since the beginning of the last school year but we would like to announce our engagement he bent down and kissed the beuatiful french girl and the family and friends congratulated them well well it seems that we have a whole lot of stuff to celebrate this summer this is good news all around my wife and i congratulate the two couples in their happy announcements and invite you all to stay up for all the time you want and help us celebrate mr weasley said this and conjured butterbeers and brought out a bottle of ogden firewhiskey for the adults the drinks were passed around to those who wanted to join in and there were cheers and congratulations all around the rest of the summer went quite well with swimming quidditch movies and fun all around they got their letters and found that they were going to be having an interesting year next year and told their parents and or guardians about what they were going to be doing next year with the junior auror trianing a n2 ok that is the 100th chapter to this story half way there i have posted the original final chapter to this story as a seperate story please read and let me know what you think that is not how this is going to end as you can tell from some of the things that are going on in it so please enjoy chapter 101 prefects and captains hermione ron and harry all received basically the same letter from the head of their house saying that harry and hermione were made the fifth year prefects for the house and that ron was made the captain of the house quidditch team for his useful ness for tactics and planning he was also brought forward to become the main keeper since oliver wood graduated harry and ron exchanged letters right away letting the other know what had happened harry and hermione were sitting with her parents talking about what was going to be going on next year and were happy that they were named the prefects together that way they were good to be the heads of the school in a couple of years little did they know they had also received the owls letting them know that they were chosen for the junior auror training program this next year and informing them whom the others were going to be also they found that they were going to have to go back to school the third week in august to start their training and to get their new rooming assignments they werentgoing to be rooming in their dorms anymore but still have their responsibilities for prefects they found out that the other 5th year prefects were going to be draco malfoy and pansy parkinson of slytherin dudley dursley and padma patil of ravenclaw susan bones and justin finch fletchley sorry about the spelling of hufflepuff and harry potter weasley and hermione granger of gryffindor the head boy and girl are mike manjory of slytherin and cho chang of ravenclaw well at least he is one of the nice guys in slytherin i know i donthave any problems with mike do you harry hermione was trying to put something of a happy thought to that no i donthave any problems with mike he a great guy a little ambitious but that what probaby what got him into slytherin in the first place i know he is a really nice guy and draco looks up to him his family never followed the dark lord when he was around and he is just he harry smiled at the look that hermione gave him and he gave her a quick kiss before they went back to their homework that they had for the upcomming year how do you think that they are going to be doing the rooming assigments hermione i mean look the ones that are in the groups are all couples that are friends of ours it says that we will be assigned a trainer and they will also be our mentor for the training i wonder who will be ours harry was thinking about this when they got a owl from ron telling them about his becoming the quidditch captain and congratulating them on the prefect positions harry decided to send an owl out to ron also congratulating him on the captanaincy and also for the getting into the group for the training they were getting ready for the others who would be arriving in a week for harry and neville birthday party they were planning a big picnic type party out on the lawn with the elves and a few of their other new friends that were there the elves were planning a surprise for the birthday boys and werenttelling anyone about it so harry what do you think the elves are planning for this birthday ceremony that they are doing for you and neville hermione was hoping that he had an answer to this for she hadntbeen able to get anything from the elves besides that it would be a surprise and not to worry i know nothing mione i mean you are the one that is into the research all the time i haventbeen able to get hide nor hair from their leader he did say that we arentto worry about it tho and i am tempted to believe him for his tribe seem to be trustworthy with this i am just going to sit back and enjoy this while i can now what would you like to do today we have the house to ourselves for the next couple of days for tonks was just here yesterday did she look ok to you she seemed to be having some troubles with walking around and being in some pain the last time she was here i hope that she isnthaving the kids to soon or is 2 months early to soon harry was really worried for she was his sister in law and charley would kill him if he let something happen to her and the babies dontworry harry i dontthink that she was going into labor already even tho from what i hear 2 months early isntthat bad for twins especially if their really magical or if she is farther along than they have been saying i dontthink that is the reason tho for they had been married for almost 4 months before she got pregnant so why would they lie about something like that now the twins were probably just kicking and they will calm down pretty soon she smiled at the worry that harry had over tonks and her kids she knew that he would be a great father to their kids some day preferably after they get done with school she knew that they had done that already a couple of times this summer but they were careful and she wasntworried about becoming pregnant anytime soon why dontwe go down to the lake and go swimming for a while then we can come back for dinner and maybe go see a movie we still have a couple of days before your guys birthday so let go have some fun before we have to get set up for the party she smiled at the look on his face when she had said this and gave her a quick kiss ok he said this next part with a wicked grin on his face and a crooked lopsided grin with or without suits today he smiled innocently at her and she had to laugh at that one well i think that we could go with suits today for it is getting a bit late out and also a bit cold dontworry we will go without again sometime this summer she smiled shyly at him and gave him a quick kiss before running upstairs to get into her bikini harry looked a bit disappointed but not too disappointed as he watched her run up the stairs he ran up behind her and headed into his own room and slipped into his trunks before grabbing his wand and a towel and heading downstairs where she was waiting for him ready to go love harry asked her with a smile yep lets get going this is going to be a quick dip only for it is getting a little late she didntwant to tell him the real reason that she was taking him out to swim for a couple of hours the rest of the guests were coming for the party tonight a couple of days early for the elves had told them that their celebration was going to be a all day thing and not to have anything else planned they had decided to have it now and to have a early birthday party for the two of them they made their way down to the lake for a swim hermione dived in quickly and splashed harry making him jump in also and splash her back as they were having a bit of fun in the lake the rest of the guests minus ginny and neville were potkeying and aparating into the house to get ready mr and mrs granger also came home early or in all actuallity they werentcoming home early they were coming home right on time just telling the kids that they were going to be later so that they could be there for the surprise party a n ok i think that i am going to end this story here and start on the sequel when i get some time this story has gone on for way to long and the first of two sequels will start with harry and nevilles birthday bashes and then cover years 5 6 and 7 please if you dontlike this idea just think that it will be cutting it up into two stories the sequel is one that i have an idea for a title but if you have one that sounds better let me know my idea is to call it harry potter and the order of the half blood teacher incorporating the titles of year 5 and 6 and what year 7 is going to be partly about thank you for reading and giving me great reviews i will be starting on the sequel pretty quickly but dontknow when it will be started donald harry weasley chapter eleven norbert a n this note is in response toteiichi for the last chapter in response to your review i will tell you that i am not going to be putting harry childhood into this story because it would make the story just to long but for you and anyone else that is interested i will be putting a side story when i get done with this one about his childhood also he does know about what happened to his parents and it will also be about how he was able to handle his celebrity status much more easily thank you for bringing this up and reviewing my story i hope that this answers your question donald when they returned to school for the new term they were all happy and got into there classes again it was around may when they had there final quidditch match against slytherin to see who would win the quidditch cup it was a nasty little game in which the score was tight but it was going good for the gryffindor when suddenly harry saw the snitch and went in after it but something happened his broom all of the sudden started going haywire and tried to start bucking him off hermoine looked over at the teachers stand and saw both snape and quirrel acting weird she saw snape muttering something and thought that he was cursing harry broom to throw him off she mumbled something to ron about doing something about helping harry and snuck off to do something she went behind the stands and snuck up behind professor snape and caught his robes on fire to stop the curse this happened when he found that his attention wavered and so did quirrels and harry got back onto his broom and caught the snitch for a gryffindor win of 160 150 there was an eruption of clapping and cheers from everyone in the stand except the slytherin s all the gryffindor went down to congratulate the team on there win of both the game and the cup when the team was finally able to get to there locker room they got there showers and headed for there usual end of game trip to hogsmeade for a post game calm down drink harry had finally gotten permission for hermoine and ron to join them on these and the team welcomed them with open arms ron was welcomed as a future team member and hermoine was welcomed as not only the team manager but also as harry lady they got back to the castle in time for dinner and had a good day so far hagrid had asked harry ron and hermoine down to his cabin that night so that he could talk to them when they showed up and knocked on his door there was a ruckus going up from hagrid dog fang shut up fang while i open the door to let our guests in welcome welcome come on in you three when the three of them walked in they found that the hut was a bit hot and they were wondering why why is it so hot in here hagrid harry asked the big man but as soon as they saw the egg sitting on the table ron and harry knew what it was where did you get the dragon egg does dumbledore know about it hermoine was flabbergasted to say the least when they said dragon egg she being a muggle born didntknow that there were such things as dragons even tho she had read about them she thought they werentaround here where did you get it hagrid isntit illegal to breed or raise dragons by a private witch or wizards calm down hermoine it not what you think i won it in a bet and i asked you three down here to watch it hatch i know that ron and harry brother charlie is a dragon handler in romania and that this is a once in a lifetime experience while they were talking there was a loud cracking sound coming from the egg when they all looked over they saw the said egg was hatching oh hagrid it hatching we get to see a baby dragon hatched you must be so proud hermoine was a bit soppy about this and she just gave her friends a smile when they sent a questioning look at her what can i say i love little things and look it so cute she was looking at where the egg sat an now sat a baby norwegian ridgeback dragon isnthe cute guys the said dragon looked up at them and gave a belch of flame that had set hagrid beard on fire hagrid was just laughing at what happened and was so excited i think i will call him norbert how are you going to be able to raise him highroad i mean is it safe oh i dontthink he will harm a fly but hold on a second you three i think i hear someone outside the hut when the four of them went out the door all they saw was a blonde figure running off in the distance and into the castle you three better get back up to the castle before you get caught outside the dorm rooms after dark the three of them ran off to the castle in hope of getting to the gryffindor common room without being caught as they were almost to the common room entrance they were stopped by the sight of mrs norris filches cat where ever she was filch was sure to be close by as soon as they rounded the corner they saw him and he saw them come with me you three you are going o mcgonagall office for your punishment filch growled as he led them off to there head of house office when they got there they found draco malfoy there also with his usual smug look on his face explain yourselves on why you were out after dark we were with hag hermoine was stopped with a look by ron and harry when she was about to tell her where they were they didntwant highroad to get in trouble for the dragon they had hoped that draco didnttell her about that little thing they didnthave to worry draco had other ideas on what to do about that situation well for your being out of the common room after dark you four will lose 25 points each and have one nights detention excuse me professor but did i hear you right did you say the four of us draco smug expression was quickly going away yes mr malfoy while i commend you for your decision to bring this up to me you still were out after curfew yourself so you will have to have the punishment also now the four of you off to your common rooms you will serve your detentions together tomorrow night at 9 pm the professor said this with a there will be no arguing attitude to her words the four of them left her office quietly and went to there own dorms to sleep tomorrow will be a long day for them all harry weasley chapter sixteen we have to get the sorcerer stone a n dream sequence harry ron and hermoine were sitting in the gryffindor common room discussing what they thought was going on and what was possibly happening they had come up with a few crazy ideas but none of them seemed plausible well our suspects are one person and that snape he seems to hate you harry and it would be completely plausible that he is after the stone to bring back voldemort you said that you thought it was him that was cursing you at the quidditch game trying to get you killed that makes sense considering that it stopped when i caught his robes on fire now how do we stop him from getting the stone without us ourselves getting in trouble hermoine was the smart one of the group and always had a good head on her shoulders they all sat there and thought about what they were going to do and how they were going to do it they decided to all go to bed and think on it they were going to meet up with each other in the morning before breakfast to see what they had figured out little did they know that when they went to bed that night they each would have a dream about what they had to do and how to do it hermoine dream hermoine climbed into her bed and went to sleep rather quickly she was asleep for no more than 10 minutes when she started dreaming she was sitting in the library when she saw a book on different creatures and what they were she went to go get it and started reading it said that the cerebus or three headed dog was only able to be calmed by music and that they were only for guarding special places next she found herself ron and harry going towards the dog and finding it already asleep they tried to get past him but found there way blocked by the dogs huge paw they got the paw out of the way and were about ready to go down through the trap door when the music stopped they jumped in and were caught in some kind of plant she saw that she knew what it was and she helped them through it the next thing she saw was a room of potions and ron wasntwith them then she woke up with a start and found that it was morning already and she went and got ready for the day ron dream ron was already to go get some sleep that night and had fallen asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow he started dreaming about something and he tried to remember it all ron was obviously with harry and hermoine and they were getting ready to go and get the stone when they heard a noise behind them in the common room it was neville and he told them that they werentgoing to go and lose the house points anymore a flash of light and neville was on the ground the next thing he remembered was being on a giant chess board and knowing that they had to win then he woke up and found that it was morning also harry dream harry was also ready to go to bed right away and sleep like the others he was exhausted and just wanted to sleep but also like the others he was to dream that night harry found himself going with ron and hermoine towards the third floor corridor under the invisibility cloak to avoid filch he found that they got past fluffy and went through the trapdoor next he remembered getting on a broomstick and flying somewhere next her remembered facing one of his professors in front of the mirror or erisad but he couldntmake out who it was it was foggy then he remembered waking up in the hospital wing and talking to the headmaster he woke up with the knowledge that he was going to get it but that something happened to his friends that they werentwith him at the end it was morning when he woke up so he got ready and noticed that ron was already up and downstairs when he got there the three of them said at the same time we need to get the sorcerer stone they made plans to talk to hagrid one last time to find out if there was anything that he could tell them they went down to breakfast and vowed to talk to him after classes that day harry weasley chapter three train ride and welcoming feast the weasley clan all piled through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 onto platform 9 3 4 towards the hogwart express they all said there good byes to mr and mrs weasley before boarding the train once aboard ron and harry said good bye to the twins and percy before going and finding there own compartment the older weasley didntwant to hang around with there younger siblings so they left them on there own accord to find a compartment when they found an empty one they took there stuff in and sat down they were talking when the lunch trolley lady came in asking if they wanted anything and harry bought a bit of everything for them to snack on while on there train ride excuse me have either of you two seen a frog come in here a bushy haired girl came in asking them nope sorry why has someone lost there frog ron asked her yes a boy named neville lost his toad trevor and cantfind him names hermoine granger by the way may i ask yours she came in and sat down offering her hand to the boys friendly enough ron weasley and this is my brother harry hermoine looked at the two of them with a bit of concentration you two dontlook alike are you sure your brothers sorry if i sound forward but you two look nothing alike no problem with that hermoine the weasley adopted me when i was one years old and my parents were killed by voldemort harry had a ready smile for the young lady and a twinkle in his emerald green eyes did you say that your parent were killed by voldemort when you were a baby what was your last name before you were adopted harry hermoine was interested in finding out whether or not this was who she thought it was before you ask yes i was harry potter before i was adopted i also know that i am famous for defeating the dark lord when i was one and surviving the killing curse it still is a pleasure to meet you hermoine maybe we can be friends harry smiled and shook her hand really i donthave many friends i am muggle born and dontknow much about the wizardring world i have read all i can of course but it cantbe a substitute for what you can learn growing up in the world so what house do you think your going to be in i hope that i in ravenclaw because there the ones with all the people that like knowledge above all else if not them i want to be put in gryffindor there the house of the brave and honorable students actually i dontreally care as long as i not put in slytherinn hermoine had a pretty smile and harry and ron thought that they would be good friends you donthave to worry about that mudblood slytherinn will never allow one such as you into it house a blonde haired boy was standing in the doorway with two of the biggest boys standing behind him my name is draco malfoy and these two are my friends crabbe and goyle i had heard that the famous harry potter was going to start school here this year why dontyou come with us and be one of my friends instead of hanging with the mudblood and the muggle lover draco sneered as he said this i know who my friends are and it definitely not going to be you now you can leave me and my family alone along with our new friend harry was standing at that time and was about to punch draco when percy came in behind them what going on here there isntto be fighting on the train harry what is going on he looked at his younger siblings with a bit of worry nothing percy this person was just about to leave if he knew what was good for him he had just insulted one of our new friends and i was just going to show him some respect harry smiled at his brother as he said this percy was one of his favorite older brothers even tho he loved them all yes we were just about to leave just remember this weasley s watch which side you hook up with in this war if you hook up with the wrong side you will end up hurt come on crabbe and goyle we dontwant to soil ourselves with these people they turned and brushed past percy quite rudely which got them a uncharacteristic scowl from the older boy well as long as you two arentgetting into trouble before we even get to the school turning to the young lady percy put on one of his smiles and introduced himself hello there i one of these two three older brothers that are at hogwart this year percy weasley at your service gryffindor 5th year prefect he bowed and kissed her hand hermoine giggled as he said this hermoine granger at your service sir it is nice to meet you you said there are two others on the train with you all who may the other two be if i may ask that would be us fred and george weasley ma am it is a pleasure to meet you also it is nice that our younger brothers have made such a pretty friend before they even got to school the twins walked in right after percy and bowed to hermoine also hermoine blushed at this and thanked them for there compliment fred george and percy left shortly after that and the other three talked for the rest of the way to the school they told each other about there lives so far and what there families were like when they were close to the school they changed into there school robes and rode the boats to the school as they went into the school they saw many different sites that brought different oohs and awes from the different 1st years when they were called into the great hall for there sorting they all walked in behind the older lady that had a stern but kind face the sorting hat was sat on the stool and started singing his sorting song when it

you and if you have already read this chapter please read again so that you can get the rewrite donald harry and his friends were off walking and looking around under their cloaks one night when they found themselves hiding from filch in the girls bathroom while they were hiding they heard someone come in and throw something over the stall door which hit harry in the head when he looked he found it to be a diary he decided that he would look at it later to see who it was and if he could find who to give it back to after the wait he and his friends went out of the bathroom and headed back to their dorms when harry got back to his dorm he decided it was time to see who diary it was when he looked at the cover he found that there wasntany name on it of who it belonged to he found that it was empty in fact well empty until he was looking into it for a minute or two and words became clear on the paper in front of him who is this that i speaking to the diary said i am harry weasley who are you i am tom marvolo riddle it is a pleasure to meet you harry the pleasure is mine why can i see what is being written in this book this is my essence that is in this book and i can communicate with whomever has the book at the time so basically i can answer your basic questions harry thought that this could be a convenient usage for a diary and decided to test it out who was you last owner i am sorry harry that is one thing i cantanswer i cantlet anyone know who my previous owners were is there anything else that you want to know will these attacks continue yes but someone can stop them if they tried harry was surprised at this and decided that he didntwant to know what was going on at this time he hid the diary in his trunk under a few clothes and old socks he went to sleep that night having weird dreams about talking heads and weird snakes that decided that they wanted to eat people he woke up with a start at midnight sweating bullets calm down harry it was just a dream a terrible one but just a dream he tried calming down and getting back to sleep he eventually got back to sleep only to sleep for a couple of more hours before having to get up when he got up he went down to breakfast and ate very little he went through the classes that day without paying much attention when he went back up to his dorm that night he found that the diary was gone he went through all his stuff and found that whoever got it got it without disturbing his stuff to much hmm i wonder who was able to get into my trunk without leaving a trace i will have to talk to dumbledore about this and see what he has to see about this see if he knows who this tom marvolo riddle is he made his way to the headmasters office and found that he didntknow the password he tried different types of candy both muggle and magical he finally got in on cockroach clusters and made his way up to his office come in harry and have a seat how may i help you this evening professor i was wondering if you could tell me a couple of things someone had thrown a diary into a place i was standing the other night and i had looked at it and found that it had held the essence of some former student of this school and that it is said that it would help whoever holds the diary i went to look for it after class today and found that someone was able to get into my trunk and take it out without making any disturbance my questions are do you know who could have done this the second question is do you know who a tom marolo riddle was harry was surprised at the reaction that he got from the name he wasntsure that he wanted to know after what dumbledore looked like when he heard the name i dontknow who could have gotten into your trunk harry but we will look into it did you say tom marvolo riddle where did you hear that name from tell me harry that is a name that most people donteven use anymore and the person doesnteven like it anymore it was the name of he person who had owned the diary first i guess and had left his essence in it why do you ask who is he harry was nervous now and wasntsure that he wanted to know tom riddle is also known as lord voldemort and if it was his diary that is here in the school then he might be the one controlling the person who opened the chamber of secrets we need to find them quickly and stop them harry i dontwant you to do anything rash harry but if you see anything that would point to someone that is being possessed or whatever then let me know i will professor thank you for the information and i will keep an eye out for you good night professor i better get back to my dorm and get some sleep with that harry left the headmasters office and headed back to the gryffindors dorm room on his way there he ran into colin creevey who surprised him with his ever present camera say cheese harry colin had snapped the picture before harry could even think about it thanks harry this is going straight into my photo album with that he ran off in the other direction to do just that no problem colin it my pleasure to let you take my photo harry was shaking his head as he made his way back to the gryffindor common room he needed to get his rest for they had a big game tomorrow against the slytherin and they had planned on winning harry was in his dorm room and asleep by the time his head hit the pillow harry weasley chapter thirty seven it not him when harry went down to breakfast that next morning he found that the stares of the students and professors were on him what going on here why is everyone looking at me like that harry asked his best friend and brother ron everyone thinks either you are the heir of slytherin or know who it is dontworry harry those of us that know you dontthink so draco pansy greg and vincent are trying to dispel the myth around the slytherin house while luna is spreading the word around the ravenclaws the hufflepuffs dontreally think that it is that way but dudley has a few friends in there and he is trying to get them to see the light ron was trying to sound enthusiastic about this but harry knew that it was going to be a hard time of it until they found out what was going on hey weasley have you set your beast on anyone lately the voice of blaize zambini was grating on harry nerves already and he didntreally have anything nice to say no why are you volunteering zambini i hear that it like little slytherin wanna be s harry scowl was one that would match and make snape look like a nice one the rest of the day went by similar to this and harry was constantly harangued by both the students and professors that either didntget the message or didntbelieve it that harry didnthave anything to do with it they all thought that since harry could speak with snakes as a parselmouth that he would be the one that would know about it of course no one could possibly have any clue to the truth about what was happening in fact if harry had his choice he would have preferred that it was him when he found out later whom it was at lunch that day harry spent the time in the ror looking through the books that he had borrowed from the charms professor and was looking into different things about tom riddle and what he has done before and since he left hogwart s he found that there wasntmuch written on his history and what he had done it was found out that shortly after he left the school he started in on his plan on taking over the wizardring world he started out on his reign of terror and put together his band of followers shortly there after he found that there wasntmuch more to find out but that there were rumors that salazar slytherin had a large monster in his chamber and that it was one that could petrify its victims he shook his head and hoped that it wasnttrue or if it was that it wasntthere anymore harry went to the rest of his classes that day and found that even tho there werentany more that were accusing him of it there were some more that were on his side and believed him now he was happy for this and found that he was having a good day at dinner that night he walked into the hall with a slight smile on his face and sat at the gryffindor table next to ron and hermoine hey it seems that our plan on dissuading the students about me being the heir is working i haventreally been bothered about it since lunch harry was smiling when he said this but his smile was soon turning into a frown when he heard the unmistakable voice of blaize zambini yelling over to him hey weasley i hear that you werentaround most of the day were you down in the chamber playing with your little pet maybe you were planning on your next victim so who is it going to be maybe your little mudblood girlfriend there yah that it she is going to be the next he was cut off rather quickly when draco decked him to shut him up draco didntlike the little pretender to the throne of the slytherin house snape looked down at his favorite student with a sneer and told him as much as i hate to say this mr malfoy you will be having detention with me tonight meet me in my classroom after you have dinner and you will be cleaning cauldrons tonight he went back to his dinner and if he had noticed the draco was smirking after that he didntlet on it was worth it he shouldnthave been saying what he was everyone should know that harry wouldntbe the one who is doing this i dontpersonally know who it is but i know that the great salazar slytherin wouldntchoose a proud gryffindor as his heir draco finished up his dinner and made his way out of the great hall down to the potions classroom for his detention he knew that he had to face his punishment for what he did he also knew that it was worth getting the detention to defend one of his friends he never thought at the beginning of his first year that he would become friends with harry weasley or that his parents would turn their back on the death eaters completely but it has happened a malfoy and a weasley were friends now and their parents were on speaking terms this is going to be one to go down in the history books maybe it will even be in the next version of hogwart a history about how the slytherin and the gryffindor houses have put aside their differences hmm this is going to be an interesting next five and a half years that we re here at the school i wonder what will happen over the next few years he was mumbling to himself as he started in on his detention then on his homework that night so do you think that draco meant what he said in their tonight ron harry was a bit worried but he didntwant to voice his concerns to anyone else that would think he is crazy sure i do harry he hasntshown any type of dissent towards us i know what the history of are families are but even mum and dad are happy that we are all getting along now they re even getting along with the malfoys now i never thought that it would happen but it has hey hermoine i think that the next version of hogwart a history will have something in it about us and how we have brought the houses together what do you think ron turned to the other member of the trio that was quickly turning into a lot more people i think you are right ron and i also believe that he should be trusted he hasntdone anything to prove us wrong about his intent i am happy to have them on our side instead of against us actually hermoine went back to her book that she was reading and was happy that her friends were showing interest in their work more chapter forty nine exposing the imposter and opening the chamber harry and ron turned on their three brothers with their wands out you three go back to the dorm and make sure everyone is all right your not coming with us we work better alone and we dontwant you to get hurt they were looking serious when they said this and fred george and percy werentsure that they wanted to argue with them but also they didntwant to face their mother if something would happen to the youngest weasley without them trying to help out i dontthink so you two your not going to go down there at all and if you think you are you dontthink that we will let you go without our help do you percy was stern when he said this and fred and george were nodding their heads in agreement with their older brother we thought so at a nod from harry they raised their wands yelling petrificus totalus and stupefy while dodging the third ones attempt at stopping them they stunned the third one also before putting them in the bathroom and went off to find lockhart to tell him what they knew when they got to the dada classroom they found him packing his stuff up quickly and getting ready to leave what do you think your doing professor arentyou going to help out our sister why are you leaving the two students were completely dumbstruck by the look that their professor had as he was getting ready to leave well yes i was actually leaving so sorry for your sister she was a smart student but there isntanything that i can do to help her you know dontbelieve everything that you read in books boys sometimes they are totally falsified with that he turned his back on them and continued on with his packing what he didntnotice when he turned his back was them pointing their wands at him and then he felt the cold point of a wand in his back as they told him this we dontthink so you are going to help us and the only reason we re taking you with us is because there is no one else that we can trust to help us here now march and i will take that before you think about doing something stupid ron took his wand and they started marching him out of the classroom and towards the bathroom on their way to the bathroom they were talking about what was wrong with what lockhart was doing why did you say that you did all those things if you didn t i mean did any of it actually happen ron was a more than a bit mad at the teacher that the females were all going goo goo over do you think that the readers out there are interested in hearing that horris the honorable had defeated the hag of horichy or that matilda the lame was the one who talked the banshee from taking down the village that had taken her homeland no they wanted someone that they could love and was heroic like you dontknow this but i wasnta gryffindor like you two i was actually a slytherin yes i was one of the dreaded snake children i didntdo all those things but i am one of those that would take advantage of those that were of weak minds i would get their stories and then use a memory charm on them to make it so that they forgot what it was that they just told me that they did then i would take their stories and say i did it now doesntthat sound like it is a most slytherin thing to do i actually went to school with your parents ron and they didntlike me at the time either that is actually funny that i was one of those that were looked down at because of the way i looked and for the house i was in now i one of the most beautiful wizards in the world now you were leading me down to take out the basilisk as you obviously figured out that is the problem have you found out a way to take it down or are we going to go in and fly by the seat of our pants on this one the professor was looking like the two of them didntknow what they were doing and he was worried that they would get him killed along with themselves instead of an innocent young girl that got herself taken away by the true evil we know how we re supposed to take it out but we arentsure where we are to get one it is said that it is best to take off it head before it can look you in the eye or bite you do you have anything that can be used to take off the head of the basilisk harry was looking at their prisoner from a new point of view right now he didnttrust him to help them but he promised that they would take a professor with them when they got to the bathroom harry went looking around the sinks that myrtle told them about while ron kept an eye on their prisoner while he was looking he could hear the voice of the basilisk as if it were far away but still loud enough to hear damn we need to get in there to help her harry was mumbling under his breath until he found the symbol of the snake on the faucet when he saw it he muttered open in parselmouth and the sinks started to move out of the way come on you two i think that this is the way in harry moved out of the way and showed them that the sinks and mirrors were moving out of the way to reveal the entrance to a large pipe that lead underground come on you first professor i dontwant you at our backs yet professor lockhart hesitated before the prodding of ron wand pushed him to jump into the pipe after he went in harry told ron to go down and he soon followed what he found when he got to the bottom of the shaft made his heart freeze chapter fifty one inside the chamber after harry left ron with lockhart to take care of him and to start digging a hole big enough for him and ginny to crawl through when they got back he started walking down the corridor and looking for something that might be what he is looking for as he was walking he kept hearing the voice of what he could only assume was the basilisk it kept telling him that he was sorry for hurting his friends and that he was only put down here by salazar slytherin to watch over his chamber he understood why he was down here and that he wouldntstop him from taking out the evil he only asked that the young parselmouth would be able to some how let him live out the last days of his life harry thought on this while he was walking down the corridor he didntknow how long the basilisk had to live but he didntthink that it was long from what he had read in the books the basilisk werentimmortal they only lived for what seemed like just over a millennium i will let you be as long as you dontattack me old one i know that you only have a little bit longer to live from what i have read in the books about your kind if you have truly been down here since salazar time you only have a short time before you go on to where basilisk go when they die just let me get there and find my sister and i will let them know up top that you were defeated your sister is the little red headed one isntshe she is in much danger from one of my original masters heirs he is down here but he isn t he is in spirit but getting stronger please hurry young parselmouth she needs you quickly no one has been killed this time was there no old one no one was killed this time they were all lucky in that they didntget the full blast of your vision i am on my way but how much farther is it til i find out where you are you donthave much farther we can hear your footsteps on the other side of the chamber door you should be on the other side of an ancient door just use your snake speak to order the door to be opened and you will find us in there thank you old one open when harry said this the doors that he was standing in front of creaked open and he found himself in a large chamber that had statues of large snakes and doors all around wow the chamber of secrets it is huge much bigger than i thought it would be harry was in awe as he looked around for ginny he found her on the far side of the chamber with a boy in black standing over her muttering some words the boy was transparent but harry could tell that he was becoming more and more into life while ginny seemed to breath shallower and shallower your to late harry i have finally gotten my body back tom riddle the younger version was laughing when he said this harry heard from the old one that he still had about ten minutes to save his sister harry was running through his mind what he could do and it came to him with a quick thought he sent a message to the old one hey old one can i have your help in something quickly i need to destroy the diary before he can get his body back i thinking that if we used your fang and sent it through the diary it will be destroyed and so will his essence i will let you have one of my fangs young one to destroy the crazy one i can tell that my time is up anyway do you see that sword that is sitting on the dias over there that is the sword of gryffindor use it to kill me and take my fang i am almost dead anyway so dontworry about it harry went and grabbed the sword and walked over to the basilisk are you ready old one i will make this as quick as possible so you wontsuffer that much as the basilisk lowered his head harry ran the sword through one of it eyes and into his brain killing him instantly he then took out one of the fangs and turned towards the boy in black are you ready to die again tom harry was smiling for he was near the diary and he was ready to take down this menace to society tom turned towards the young gryffindor and said your to late young one i can already feel the life draining from the young girls body there is nothing that you can do boy you are crazy tommy boy not only will i save my sisters life but i will also end this now with that harry took the fang and drove it through the heart of the diary and tom marvolo riddle ghostly essence was no more good bye and good riddance tommy boy i hope that i will never have to face you again harry ran over to ginny and picked her up checking her pulse when he found that she was still alive he walked out of the chamber saying good bye and thank you to the old basilisk bye the time that ron harry gilderoy and ginny made their way out of the chamber dumbledore and the rest were back from the ministry and ginny was awake again thank you for saving me harry and ron i didntmean to let the thing out is everyone ok tom was manipulating me through the diary is he gone ginny was crying now because she was afraid that she was going to be expelled for this everyone ok or will be in a couple of days when the potion is done that will bring them out of their sleep dontworry ginny i dontthink that they will expel you for this after you tell them what happened harry and ron were comforting their little sister not knowing if what they just said was true or not you are correct mr weasley we wontbe expelling her for this we know that it wasnther fault and that she was controlled by the memory of tom riddle now why dontthree get to the hospital wing to get checked out what happened to lockhart he seems to be out of it dumbledore was asking this question but he thought that he knew what was wrong it was a backfired memory charm sir he doesntremember what happened or who or what he is it like a complete mind wipe that happened it wasntour fault that this happened sir he was a fraud and he tried to cast it with ron old broken wand harry was smiling at the thought but was worried for the man ah i see well it seems that it to st mungo for him to see what they can do to help him now off to the hospital wing your friends have all taken the potion and are about ready to leave there also you shouldntbe there long just long enough for madame pomphrey to make sure that your ok dumbledore had his twinkle in his eyes again and the three students made their way to the hospital wing they werentin the wing for long before they were all shuttled off with their friends the rest of the school year went quite well and quietly hermoine and the others caught up on their missed homework with the help of the others ginny had no long lasting side effects of being controlled by tom harry hermoine ron ginny draco pansy neville dudley luna and surprisingly enough parvarti patil got closer as friends over the rest of the year it seems that dudley and pavarti had hit it off as friends right away and she was at his side in the hospital wing while he was out of it at the leaving feast that year it was quite a feast gryffindor won the house and the quidditch cup again ron and harry were given special commendations for their work in the saving of their sister and what they did to help save the school everyone was excited about the upcoming summer holiday for they were going to be having fun this summer hermoine parents invited harry to come along with them on vacation to france and he readily agreed after getting permission from the weasley s they were going to be gone for a couple of weeks but be back in time to go to the burrow for the rest of the summer holiday and harry birthday what harry didntknow and wasntgoing to find out was that her parents wanted to meet harry and to get to know him better they knew that harry and hermoine were getting closer and they wanted to know the boy that might one day become their daughters boyfriend and someday their son in law dudley was invited to come over to the burrow along with the patil twins and they said that they would come over for harry birthday and then stay for the rest of the summer a n i know that it didntgo as the book went but i hoped you liked year two just as much this one chapter covered what had originally been

my spelling of the houses i really appreciate that hpstoryguy thank you for being glad that it is so long i dontsee many epic length stories on this site and i actually like reading them i find that this story is going to be around 300 to 350 thousand words what i consider epic length is 100 or more chapters for you that would like to know shivani no this isntjust a copy of the book even tho it may look like it there are some parts that cantbe messed with and would have to look like they were taken from the book even tho i put my own spin on things you will also find that i might put things that happen in the wrong order but they are put in the order that i think that they happened i am sorry if this offends anyone but it is my story and i sticking to it smiles hermoinegirl ok i can take constructive criticism but saying that i suck because i like harry ginny being together is a little harsh so you wontbe calling me even more bad things i can guarantee that this will not be a harry ginny story well that covers all my reviews so far for this story and i will be doing this again probably in about 10 or 20 chapters i have a special treat for all my readers i am going to give you the major pairings that are going to happen in this story they will be harry hermoine ron luna ginny neville and i think i am going to let draco love life be a surprise to you for later in the story thank you all again for your reviews donald it was halloween and everyone was happy and excited about the upcoming feast that was going to happen that night the trio was spending part of the day getting some last minute homework done so that they could have the whole weekend for themselves to have fun and enjoy it that night as the feast was going into full swing in the great hall draco malfoy was being a git as usual in his teasing of hermoine and she was just not being able to take it much so she left the hall in tears as she ran off she headed to the girls bathroom in tears to cry about how much she hated malfoy and that her only two friends were boys she was in there when the commotion started in the great hall and didntknow what was going on all she knew was that after a while she wasntalone anymore for there was a big troll in the bathroom with her and she wasntable to do anything about it she was cowering in the corner under one of the sinks hoping that it didntnotice her when something happened that she couldntbelieve ron and harry came in and helped her a few minutes earlier in the great hall professor quirrel came rushing into the great hall in a huff saying that there was a troll loose in the school then he fainted dead away of course there were a lot of screaming and shouting from the students and the headmaster raised his voice to get everyone attention now everyone follow your prefects to your dorms in an orderly fashion and professors come with me to take care of this problem as the students all followed there perspective prefects to there dorms the professors followed dumbledore in there quest to find the troll all the professors except professor quirrell who was still out cold and professor snape who had slipped out through the side door the great hall on his own mission to get the troll as ron and harry left the hall and were following percy they remembered that hermoine was out there still somewhere on her own because she didntknow about the troll we have to find hermoine let go harry dragged ron off practically to go find there friend when they rounded a corner they found a shadow and a rumbling coming from around the next corner indicating that they had found the troll they decided to hide and wait to see where the troll went when they saw him go into the girls bathroom they decided to lock him in and get a professor when they locked him in they heard a muffled scream that sounded like a girls scream and unlocked and rushed in to see if they could help they had found hermoine in a corner under one of the sinks trying to defend herself against the troll but being quite ineffective present when hermoine saw her two friends in the bathroom she let out a scream and the troll turned around to see what she had saw when he had seen ron and harry he started after them with a grunt harry raised his wand and was immediately picked up by his ankle and the troll was about to brain him with his club when ron cast awingardium leviosa spell on the trolls club to levitate it above the trolls head the troll just looked at the club running above his head with a stupid look on his face and then the spell disappeared and the club knocked him senseless on the head and he dropped with harry luckily harry had the reflexes to get out from underneath the troll when the troll started to wake up harry stuck his wand up his nose knocking the troll out again when he pulled the wand out of the trolls nose ron said ewe troll buggars hermoine ran and gave them a big hug in thanking them for rescuing her as she was hugging harry professors snape quirrel mcgonagall and dumbledore came in wondering what had happened and how the troll was not there snacking on the students bones for a snack hermoine was the first to react and said i sorry professors i thought that i could take care of it by myself and ron and harry came in to rescue me the four professors looked at her with disbelief but couldntdeny that it is possible that is what happened so snape was about to punish the students when mcgonnagal said that they were her students and that she would take care of the punishment snape gave his usual snort and stormed out of the bathroom with quirrell on his tail mcgonagall turned to her three favorite students and said there wontbe any punishment for this in fact i award the two mr weasley 20 points each for taking down a fully grown troll and in further more i award you ms granger 10 points for your loyalty now you fours go off to your tower and dontmention anything about what happened here tonight do i make myself clear on this the three students just nodded there head and said there good nights to the two professors as they ran out and too the gryffindor common room and off to bed they were just glad that they werentkilled tonight and were awfully tired they all had some interesting dreams that night about what happened and not all of them were nightmares chapter 73 boxing day of surprises and miracles a n ok here it is finally we find out who the surprise visitors are i know you probably have figured it out already but this will make it official donald remus came out of the living room and when sirius asked if it was them he just nodded then the two of them fainted draco and pansy looked at the two men then went into the living room to see who was there and why they would make the two dada teachers faint what they found when they walked in was a man with messy black hair that looked like an older version of harry and a red haired woman with his green eyes please excuse us for interrupting you all but remus and sirius have passed out in thedining room after seeing you two for some reason may i ask who you are draco was looking confused when he saw the smiles on the faces of the two people well young man how should i put this i am james and this is my wife lily potter we are harry parents i know that we were killed 14 years ago but by some miracle we have been brought back now did you say remus and sirius are in the kitchen we must wake them up now mustntwe james had a wicked smile on his face and went into the kitchen dumping a bucket of ice water on them they waked up with a start and looked at him with joy in their eyes is that really you james we thought you were dead are you and lils really back sirius was shocked to say the least to see the two people that were friends of his for many years while he was in school alive and well after they were killed so many years ago made his mind go blank remus wasntthat much better

behind her from the kitchen that would be me mione i harry sister dawn lupin had just walked in and came over to hug her brother and her parents she had been told earlier that day that she had a brother and that he was harry potter she had always wondered where she had gotten the scar that was on her shoulder in the shape of a lightning bolt and her adopted father had told her this morning he had explained that he didntwant to tell her before they came here for the school year and just now had the chance she had forgave him of this for she knew that he had been through a lot over the years

minutes yah mum and dad i am so happy to have another sister so what are you going to call this one mum and dad dawn was smiling at the thought she was truly happy for her parents well we thought about calling her angel marie potter angel because she is going to be our little blessing that we werentexpecting but will love just like our other two children marie after my grandmother james said this with a smile then he got a strange look on his face and looked at hermione with an interest excuse me hermione but did harry say that you last name is granger yes sir why do you ask hermione was getting a little bit nervous now but saw the look in his eyes that had her trusting him their names are frank and jane granger their muggle dentists james looked at lily with bewilderment in his eyes and then let out a laugh please did you just say that they were dentist lily had a little giggle at that also for she knew who they were and thinking that those two being dentists made her giggle yes why do you know them but how their muggles and never had heard of the magical world before arentthey hermione was getting a little worried right now but was thinking that she was a little powerful for just being a muggle born harry wrapped his arms around hermione and held her close dontworry mione i am here and we will find out what they are going on about together harry gave her a kiss and held her hand dontworry you two it nothing bad hermione will you please go use the floo and have your parents come here by way of the floo please tell them james and lily are back and they will come right away lily said this with a smile for the younger girl and hermione went to do as asked she stuck her head in the fire after throwing in some floo powder and yelled out granger household when her head quit spinning around she saw her parents sitting there in the living room reading some books that she thought she had seen the titles before but they couldntbe they were magical books of hers mum dad i have a few friends that have asked for you to floo to the burrow right away they want to see you again she almost fell through the fireplace when she saw her parents look at each other and ask who are they hermione we are kind of busy at this time james and lily said that they want to see you again lily said that you would come right away if i told you that hermione did fall out of the fireplace back into the burrow when she saw the excitement in her parents eyes we will be right there they told her as she left through the fire they said that they will be right here mr and mrs potter may i ask how you know them tho she was about to ask again when she heard a couple of pops in the living room right behind her and she turned around looking at her parents who had just obviously aparated into the burrow that would be because we are a witch and wizard hermione and no your not a muggle born you are quite definitely a pureblood her mother smiled as she saw hermione faint dead away into harry arms and harry smiled up at them and fainted also after he realized what they had said a n ok i hope that you dontkill me for the last surprise of the season in the story i

tournament in year 4 as always read and review donald january the month of january found the third years going through much more studying and reviewing for upcoming tests and learning they were reviewing what they had learned the last few months and having fun in their classes potions was even getting more fun since professor snape had forgiven the marauders when they came up to him and apologized for their antics when they were teenagers this was quite a site when james sirius and remus came one friday night for dinner after the new year started they sat down at the head table at the urging of the headmaster and they were talking for a bit all through dinner you could see professor snape looking at them with disgust and contempt as if he was saying how dare you come to the school again potter when the three of them followed professor snape out of the great hall that night james called out hey severus can we talk to you for a few minutes please severus snape turned towards the man that he had hated from his school days and sneered you have 5 minutes then i have detentions to go do this night james looked him over and saw that lily was right in that what they had done was completely wrong in their actions against him so many years ago well severus we were wondering if you wanted to help us drink a couple of bottles of ogden tonight while we tried to apologize for our actions while we were teenagers we know now that what we did back then was totally wrong and lily would like to have her friend back that she had when she was a teenager severus could tell that he was serious about this and he just nodded and led them down to his quarters in the dungeons to have a talk and a drink before he left he yelled into the great hall all detentions that were with me tonight have been rescheduled for monday night have a good weekend the students gasped when they heard him say this but werentgoing to argue there was a great cheer coming from the great hall and snape was shaking his head as he went down to the dungeons the next day found a smiling professor snape lupin and black along with a smiling mr james potter as they left the dungeons laughing and having a good old time when they went down to the great hall for breakfast no one could tell that they had gone through a case of ogden firewhiskey for snape had a bunch of anti hangover potions ready for it what did surprise everyone in the hall was when he stood up and announced i would like to apologize to all the gryffindor s hufflepuffs and ravenclaws for being a unfair teacher just because i have had a grudge against some people all detentions with me have been cancelled and the last 200 points that i have taken from each house have been reinstated he sat down to the open mouthed stares from the students there was a loud cheer coming from the whole student body and a standing ovation for their potions master dumbledore had his constant twinkle for he was happy that everything had gone well the last night between the marauders and the potions master well it looks like we are going to have something to celebrate today there will be a unannounced hogsmeade trip today with all students being allowed to go today if they would like all students that are under year 3 will be taken in groups by house by a teacher their will also be a celebration tonight of dinner the house elves will put up a great feast so make sure your there for it thank you and all of you have a great day today dumbledore sat down to the applause of all the students the professors looked at him and he just smiled if you dontwant to take a group of student s i wontforce you i will be taking a group of them myself and plan on having a great time with them this day excuse me headmaster i know i not considered a professor officially but may i take a group of the students also today james was looking like he was going to burst with happiness at having a new friend around here he knew that lily and severus had been friends for years and that she was sad that james and him didntget along of course james i was going to ask if you would like to teach anyway i have finally persuaded professor binns that he was dead and he has decided that he was going to go off to his final reward once i found a replacement for the history of magic position dumbledore had a smile on his face when he saw that james was nodding his head in agreement to do so thank you headmaster looks like the marauders will be teaching the students of hogwart now he smiled down at the students and had a laugh professor mcgonagall had a worried look on her face but knew that albus knew what he was doing welcome to the staff james i glad to have someone that the students wontfall asleep to in the class she smiled at the man and was actually happy that he was going to do this attention students i have two other announcements to make today one i am glad to announce that professor binns has finally figured out that he dead and will be going off to his great beyond once i announce who the new history of magic professor is the second announcement is to tell you who your new professor is i would like to introduce you to the new professor of history of magic professor james potter there was an uproar of approval for the new professor and of good luck to the former one well this school year has just gotten more interesting i think that i going to be liking the history of magic class more now now should we get ready to go to hogsmeade guys harry was smiling at his friends and girlfriend the rest of the month went by without any problems and had been a very happy one for everyone harry and his friends introduced lightning and her mate and foal to both james and lily who were surprised to hear about how harry had come up with the unicorn they spent the day with them and had a nice little picnic february february brought on unseasonably warm weather there was some reports of the former minister of magic actions with voldemort former death eaters going out after some of the muggles in europe while they werentas organized as they were when voldemort ran them they were still wreaking havoc on both the magical and muggle world harry was a little worried but knew that if the auror couldnthandle it then he wouldntbe able to at least at this time he decided that he would talk to the headmaster about the possibility of him and the others training for the possibility of a fight in case they came to the school he also decided that they wouldntdo it until possibly next year the middle of february brought around valentine day and a ball for the school the teens got together with their partners to decide to go to the dance together the girls were giggling and having fun getting ready for the dance it was decided that it would be a romantic type where everyone would get all dressed up in a twenty style clothing they went down to hogsmeade the weekend before to get their costumes and have fun the girls all got their flapper outfits and the guys got zoot suits for the occasion the dance was held on a saturday night and the guys were downstairs in the respective dorm common rooms waiting for their dates to come down ready for the dance the guys all looked great in their suits even tho some of them looked a bit out of sorts considering that they were pure bloods or half bloods that werentsure about what was so big about these muggle clothing they all had a smile on their faces tho when they saw the girls come down in their outfits the dance went quite well with some of the teachers putting together a big band with some help from people from hogsmeade and around different areas and the ministry the kids were having fun with some of the stranger types of dances the rest of the month went with little or no problems remus and sirius started to teach them about boggarts and how to defeat them when you face a boggart you must remember to think of what you fear most and then think of the most ridiculous thing that you can think of the spell that you shout at it when you face one is ridiculous and then it will turn into the thing that will have it looking like what you wonthave a fear of it anymore he then told them to line up in front of the box and then when the first one came up he opened up the box and the boggart came out ron faced the box and a giant spider came out ron was shaking in his shoes when it showed up and he was stuttering when he saw it he finally thought of it with tap shoes on and doing a stupid tap dance and shouted ridiculous and the spider sported tap shoes and started to a silly tap dance sending everyone into fits of giggles very good ron 10 points to gryffindor for that who next let me see draco malfoy let see what it is that you fear draco came up and when the boggart faced him it turned into voldemort coming at him to place the dark mark on him he thought of the most silly thing that he could and shouted ridiculous with that voldemort turned into a little kitten being chased by a big snake very good mr malfoy 10 points to slytherin next we will hermione go at it hermione came forward and faced her worse fear it was the headmaster telling her that they made a mistake about her and breaking her wand then sending her home she thought of something silly and shouted the spell the headmaster turned into a little baby wanting his mommy and a younger version of mcgongall came up and picked him up cuddling him interesting outcome there ms granger 10 points to gryffindor the rest of the class went like that and harry having the class end when a dementor came out for him but the professor stopped it before he could do anything class dismissed homework is 2 feet of parchment on the different ways to defeat a boggart harry was asked to stay back for a few minutes after the rest of the class was dismissed he told ron draco pansy dawn and pansy to go ahead to lunch and that he would be right down he gave hermione a kiss and waited for them to leave the room before going up to the two professors and asking what was up well harry we were thinking that since you have a thing with dementor from the looks of your boggart we thought we would teach you the patronus charm it the only spell that will take out both dementors and lethifolds it a rather easy spell to cast just a hard one to master we will start after dinner tonight so if you would please come to the classroom for an hour directly after dinner we will begin remus smiled at his best friends son and let him get to his friends for lunch harry agreed to doing this and went down to his friends at the great hall he told them what was going on and they agreed that he should go through with learning the spell they also thought that he could teach those that would want to learn just in case fudge decides to come at us with them looks like they might be agreeing with you bro i hope that you learn it fast i hear that it a hard spell to master dawn smiled at her twin and gave him a pat on the arm before going back to her lunch well i sure that i can probably handle it so i not worried on another note have you noticed that the headmaster has been looking at us rather weirdly dawn harry looked up at the headmaster just as he was looking at the two of them rather interestingly yah i know what you mean harry but i sure there is nothing to worry about come on guys it time to go to class we have charms next and i dontwant to get professor flitwick mad at us at least we have a fairly fun class after that in that we have history of magic she smiled at the thought of her father teaching the class and wondering if he would be more interesting than professor binns was they went about their classes that day and harry picked up the patronus spell after quite a bit of practice he learned that his patronus was a stag which is his fathers ani magi form remus and sirius were both a bit surprised when that happened but were happy to tease james about how his son patronus was his father ani magi form the rest of the month went by rather uneventfully and they all had a good time harry and dawn found out why the headmaster was looking at them with such interest so much they found out that he was their great great grandfather when he approached them one day harry dawn can i speak to you for a minute please your friends can come along also if they would like for they will find out soon enough if i know enough they followed him into his office where lily and james molly and arthur remus sirius and the headmaster were waiting for them harry dawn please sit down this is something that you will want to be sitting for i might as well get this over with i am your great great grandfather on your mothers side you haventbeen told before because she didntknow at the time and so no one else knew he smiled at his two students and they all shared a hug along with congratulations on the reacquainting of the family they had a quiet amount of work for the rest of the month they had spent a couple of weekends with their family both new and old getting to know each other better the whole group got together and spend time with the unicorns in the forest and had a good time playing with the new ones lightning was proud to show off her newest foal to her father and his friends they named him mystic after the color of the grey he was it was a mystical favorable coloring for the unicorn of this area they were told that only 1 in a million new foals were colored in this way and the ones that were were enchanted in a way where they were smarter and more favored by the unicorn gods it is said that the next one would grow up to be the leader of the unicorns they were all proud of mystic and his family march march was found to come in like a lion and there was storms coming they found that they couldnthave their comc classes outdoors so hagrid taught them in the great hall with both smaller and bigger creatures one of the more interesting creatures that they found that they had tho came when they were able to go outside again they found that they were facing a hippogriff named buckbeak they were told that they had to approach buckbeak with caution and bow to show respect harry was one of the only ones that were able to approach him and have him let him ride him they found that they were going to have a great day and great times when they found that they were going to have fairly easy going at tests this year the professors decided that they would have it easy this year because next year they were going to be starting getting ready for their owl in their 5th year they were learning different things about spells and potions for the upcoming years professor snape started teaching them about the different types of healing potions more he had been asked by madame pomphrey to teach them how to make their own healing potions starting in their 3rd year they were told that they should keep stock of a few healing potions with them at all times the students were excited to learn that as of now the law against underage magic use has been lifted minister weasley had decided that with the threat of the former minister of magic out there that all students should be prepared to defend themselves while out of school the students received the news through owls from the ministry that morning as well as learning about it through the daily prophet the history of magic class soon became one of the favorites of the students instead of being the one where everyone slept through it professor potter was an interesting story teller and everyone learned to love the class his classes turned to be interesting even more once the students learned that when he was dead he had learned a whole lot from the famous witches and wizards that they were learning about he taught them things about the founders that they didntknow but were fascinated to find out about they found that while the founders did fight a bit they were truly friends even after the fall out between gryffindor and slytherinn they also found that rowena ravenclaw was not only married to gryffindor but was also an elf there were so many elves back then that they were around for everyone to know the descendants of ravenclaw were elves but didntknow it they also found that helga hufflepuff was the motherly one of them and was always seen handing out cookies to her students for merit along with house points the hufflepuffs in the class were happy to hear that what they had always heard stories of was actually true defense against the dark arts was turning out to be an interesting one this year they had started up the dueling club again and were in the middle of a tournament harry was one of the leaders of his year and having fun with it he had to face draco and hermione still but didntreally worry about it harry had an interesting duel with hermione that ended up with them each casting the expleriamus spell and harry being able to keep a hold of his wand while hermione went sailing into his hand she granted one wish to harry for the win and he took his wish and kissed her completely right there in the middle of the dueling ring then handed her the wand back he was going to give it back to her anyway but the kiss was nice thank you hermione that was a great way to celebrate a win i would have done the same for you if you would have won he smiled his lopsided grin at her and gave her another kiss your welcome harry if you thought that was great wait til you beat draco she gave him a wink and went back to the side of the dueling arena to watch the last match she saw that she had the exact effect on harry that she was hoping for he was blushing brighter than any of the weasley hair she blew him a kiss wishing him good luck and sat down she knew what she was doing in distracting him but it would make him work harder for the win she gave a laugh as she saw pansy tell draco basically the same thing and saw draco blush just as much the girls knew that they were going to congratulate their respective boyfriends whether they won or not but just had to get them to thinking they were going to congratulate them that way for this was for the championship match this was for first and second place she smiled as harry took his place on the podium to start the duel ok welcome to the final match of the third years in the dueling tournament this is for first and second place among the third years in this corner weighing in at 140 pounds of muscle from his seeking ability and training harry james potter weasley wearing the red and gold robes you all may know harry as a weasley but ever since his parents came back to life during the christmas season he has decided to take their last name also sirius gave a smile as he said this and then went on with the introductions and in this corner weighing in at a swelt 135 pound in the silver and black robes of his house the noble house of slytherin is known as the prince of slytherin draco lucious malfoy draco as you know is the son of luious and narcissa malfoy and the seeker of the slytherin quidditch team now duellers take your position on the count of three you will turn take ten paces and then turn bow and duel remember no unforgivables and please dontkill each other madame pomphrey has been notified that there might be injuries and is waiting for either or both of you in the hospital wing ok ready set one two three with that harry and draco turned walked ten paces turned back towards each other bowed and started casting spells at each other the duel went on for a couple of hours with neither of the duelist getting an upper hand on the other they showed why they were the best in their class none of the others wanted to face them for the rest of the classes were there watching and none of the other matches lasted any where near as long as this one did they were throwing curses and counter curse and jinxes that were at least a couple years ahead of them in their studies draco almost had harry down when he cast a jelly legs jinx and harry didntput up a shield in time luckily for harry he was able to cast a counter charm to it before draco was able to disarm him harry cast a bat bogey hex on draco which actually distracted him long enough for a disarming spell that had harry win the match he casts the reverse of the spell on him and they shook hands to the loud applause of the crowd hermione and pansy rushed the stage and after they were given there prizes for winning their respective places in the tournament they were dragged off to their respective broom closets for a few hours of intense snogging when the boys and girls went down to breakfast the next day they each had a smile a mile wide on their faces and were whistling a tune that no one knew the words to a n3 ok i know i said that this would encompass the rest of the school year but it was taking me way to long to write so i decided to cut it off right here and do the rest of the school year next chapter please read and review this is one of my longest chapters yet donald chapter 79 summer part 2 a n there was a question on whether arthur and molly weasley along with tonks parents had known about them getting married and the answer is yes they did and they were some of the few that were at the wedding this was just to clear that up i hope you are enjoying this story as much as i am writing it donald the plane ride went quite interestingly considering that some of the teenagers have never flown on one before they were having fun for they were booked into the first class section of the airline and since they were such a big group they had it to themselves the stewardesses were having fun with treating the large group to showing them around the plane and making sure that they had enough snacks for the long trip most of the teenagers had brought along reading material and some had even brought along muggle cd players to listen to music on the way they slept part of the way there and 16 hours later they were landing in honolulu hawaii it was early morning when they got there and they found that they had cars there waiting for them the cars took them to the small wizardring resort that was near the main part of town and on the beach they all went to their separate rooms each teen set with the adults that were to be their guardians for the summer they decided to spend the day just relaxing in their rooms and on the beach they looked like a bunch of bleach white teenagers that people could tell that they were from someplace that didntget much sun when they got there but by the time they had spent 2 weeks there at the resort they were all well tanned and toned from swimming and having fun after two weeks of tanning and sunning on the beaches of honolulu the teenagers got together at breakfast one morning to discuss what they wanted to do sightseeing wise and maybe learn some more about the ancient hawaiian magical cultures of the polynesian islands while that was mostly on hermione mind most of them had agreed with her that it would be interesting to learn about they decided to take the last two weeks of their vacation to look into the culture and polynesian magic of the islands the next three weeks were going to be spent relaxing and having fun sightseeing there was one other thing that was brought up that they were going to be doing but that wasntbrought up around harry and neville for in a couple of weeks the two of them were turning 14 on consecutive days and they were going to be celebrating both their birthdays on the 31st of july this year they were planning on having a surprise party for both the boys and had booked the hall at the resort for the occasion they had made a few new friends while they were there at the resort and the new friends were invited to join them at the party they spent the first couple of days exploring maui honolulu and the other surrounding islands learning about the various tourist spots and what they had in common with the magical world they learned that mauna loa was actually a nice goddess that had blown her top every once in a while just for show for the tourists they spent the day talking with her and learning about the different types of creatures that were living on and around the islands they were introduced to the unicorn leader of the island after they accidentally showed one of their amulets to their tour guide he had smiled at them and asked how they had been blessed so much as to get the blessing of the unicorn gods they explained that harry had helped a mother unicorn in his 1st year in the forbidden forest while on a detention and helped her deliver her daughter before she passed away from loss of blood i had raised the young foal from newborn and have seen her have her own newborn foal just this last year along with her mate i am a proud father of a unicorn and grandfather of another one it was a blessing that i took on with all my heart and had been blessed in many ways harry was humble in this and was a bit shocked when he was told that they were going to be introduced to the leader of the unicorn of the hawaiian islands the next day they teenagers were all excited about this and were proud to be known as harry friends not that they were proud to be known as that anyway they spent the rest of that day telling the adults about what they were being given the privilege to do the next day all the adults were proud of their charges and asked to be filled in on the details when they got back the group spent the rest of the day on the beach relaxing and enjoying the sun they went to a louao that night and while enjoying the food they also enjoyed the companionship the girls got the guys to go up and learn the different types of dances along with them and they all had a good time of it tonks it turned out was quite a good dancer and wasntthat clumsy while out on the dance floor they had a great time and there was fun and laughter had by all they fed themselves until they were full and had fun with the dances and music they showed some of the others some of the dances that they knew and learned a bit about the hawaiian culture while with the groups they retired for the night with dreams of coming in contact with the unicorn leader the next day and about the dancing that they did that night they woke up early the next day and were greeted by the sunshine as they made their way out towards where they were going to meet the leader they found themselves surrounded by a large herd of unicorns but not being threatened they all understood what was being said to them and they all smiled it is good to meet you all also it is a pleasure to be able to come to meet your leader my name is harry potter weasley and these are my friends and family where do we go from here to meet the rest of your herd and leader he smiled and bowed to the obvious leader of the group that met them come with us harry and friends we will take you with us to our leader she is waiting to meet you all it is a privilege to have a large group of humans be called friends of the unicorn and of course we have heard of you from our friends over seas now you will be meating with the leader of our herd and she will be welcoming you as friends of the unicorn thank you for being able to join us in this venture and i hope that it will be helpful to all the young unicorn that was leading them was happy to be able to talk to the young humans without any problems she had never been able to do this before but knew that these were special young ones and that they should be treated as friends of the unicorn which they wouldnthave been either able to talk to them or wear the special amulets of their herd harry and the others smiled as they followed the unicorn into the forested areas around the hawaiin area that they were in they walked for a little over an hour and were pleased to see among other things different types of magical creatures that they would have had to wait til at least their 5th or 6th year to see through hagrid when they reached the clearing that the unicorn called home they were pleased to see so many of them there gathered harry and the others walked up to the leader of the group and bowed to her it is a privilage and a pleasure to meet you ma am i am harry potter weasley and these are my friends and family ron weasley draco malfoy neville longbottom dudley dursley seamus finnegan dean thomas hermione granger luna lovegood ginny weasley pansy parkinson lavender brown padma and pavarti patil and dawn potter lupin my twin sister it is our pleasure to be allowed to have this conversation with you harry smiled at the elder unicorn and sat cross legged telling the others to do the same they had a wonderful meal with them discussing their plans and what they had done with their lives up to this time they made it back to their hotel rooms with plenty of time before dinner they had told all the grown ups about what their experience was like and were chatting happily with them over dinner the rest of their vacation there was spent on the beach sunning and having a good old time with sightseeing and exploring a n2 i hope that this wasntto disappointing to you but these summer chapters are just for filler chapters there is one more chapter to the summer then we go back for the fourth year yes i know that i missed one of the boys but i couldntremember who i had hooked up with the extra girl so he was back at the hotel miserable being sick he insisted that his girlfriend go anyway and have a good time please as always read and review i should have chapter 80 posted by the end of the weekend donald chapter 82 mad eyed moody albus are you sure about this guy for a dada professor i mean he might scare the students more than teach them minerva mcgonagall was putting out the concern that all of the professor have had about their new defense against the dark arts professor that the headmaster had hired for this year they all had known who mad eyed moody was and were afraid that the students would be scared of his appearance i know what everyone is going to be thinking about this assertion but since sirius and remus werentable to come back for the next couple of years to teach i had to get someone to come and teach he has agreed to teach these next couple of years and this first year will be having him analyze what students that he will be bringing into his special program starting next year i know that the students dontknow about this yet but that is one of the reasons that we have brought some of the third years up to fourth year this year yes that is one of the reasons even tho from what i have heard they are going to do good in the fourth year harry ron hermione and some of the other fourth years have been teaching them during the last week of the summer to help get them caught up i think that this was a good idea now we need to go greet alastar before breakfast this morning he is sorry that he wasntable to make it to the sorting feast last night but he has sent me an owl saying that he will be here this morning minerva mcgonagall stood up and walked out of the headmasters office with a small smile on her face she knew what albus was talking about with next year and she was looking forward to it she was also looking forward to the tri wizard tournament this year she knew that it was going to be interesting and that the students will be looking forward to meeting their counterparts from around the world alastar mad eyed moody was sitting in the three broomsticks waiting for his new employers for at least the next couple of years he had his trunk with him and nursing his hip flask while looking out the window through his ever revolving eye he was an interesting site to behold when you first see him he was scarred all over his body had part of his nose missing a wooden leg and one of his eyes was a magical one that was swiveling around and looking all over the place he was a retired auror and people respected him along with fearing him when he saw the headmaster and the deputy headmistress walk in he greeted them with a gruff hello your late well are you ready for me up at the school or not good morning to you to alastar yes we are ready for you shall we get going the students are awaiting their new dada professor with great anticipation they haventbeen told that their last ones arentreturning so this might be a bit of a surprise i hope your ready to teach young ones albus had his sparkling eyes going and he knew that the old auror would be the best to teach the students sure am headmaster do they know about what is going on next year yet he knew that they werentsupposed to know but wasntsure if any of them might have figured it out or not he had heard about harry potter weasley and his girlfriend hermione granger being a couple of the smartest in their years he also knew that if they were given any clues they might have figured it out it bad enough that they will probably figure it out by christmas he had made up his mind that if they had figured it out that they were going to be told everything he also knew about the younger ones that are being advanced into the next year so that they could be eligible to qualify for his special training next year would be a bad thing but then they are doing good from what he has been told of course he was in contact with the minister of magic and he was the father of one of the younger ones and he had learned about their extra training ok let go and get this started i am happy to be here and am wanting to get things started he gave one of his rare smiles as he said this and followed them up to the school to get started after all the introductions and his first day of classes he knew that this was going to be an interesting couple of years the students were waiting at breakfast that morning for they were told that they were going to be meeting their new dada teacher this morning they all looked towards the main doors when they opened and were a bit surprised at the person that walked into the great hall with the headmaster and the deputy headmistress he was what most of them would call a grizzled old timer and they hoped that he was as good at teaching them as their last teacher was the most disturbing part of him that most of the students were looking at was the swivelling eye that seemed to follow everyone movement and was trained on anyone and everyone at the same time when dumbledore came to the front with him he tapped his goblet and announced students may i have a warm hogwart welcoms for professor alastar mad eyed moody he is going to be teaching your dada class for the next two years with the thunderous applause that was given to the old man he bowed a bit and sat down taking a swig from his hip flask before eating his breakfast chapter 84 the arrival of beauxbatons the headmaster announced the morning of october 1st that the students from the other schools would be arriving over the next couple of days all the houses are expected to line up in their house orders outside the castle to greet them when they arrive beaxbatons will be arriving first tomorrow so classes were canceled for the day and the next couple of them for the weekend was coming up the students were excited about the upcoming arrival of the other schools harry and the gang went down to the forbidden forest to visit with lightning and her herd to tell them about what was going to be happening over the next couple of days they spent the day with the herd of unicorns and with telling them about their trip to hawaii and meeting up with the group of unicorn over there lightning was telling them about what was going on with the other groups around the forest area and how that they were finally accepted into the lair of the unicorns around here the herds were combined and was one big family unit they gathered around and were accepted into the unit as one and all they were recognized as unicorn friends for all the forbidden forest they left the forest with smiles on their faces and a song in their hearts the next day found them with their respective houses outside the castles front doors after dinner that day they were a bit nervous of the people that they were going to be meeting this day and found that they were all going to be interested in finding where they would be staying at the school they were looking all around to see how they were going to be arriving and were surprised when one of the prefect yelled out there look in the sky it a carriage being pulled by giant winged horses that must be the students from beauxbatons all the students were looking at the strange site that was coming down and landing in the courtyard of the castle it was a huge beautiful carriage and it was being pulled by quite a few huge flying horses when the carriage landed the horses gave a snort and the door opened to revealing a large women that had to be the headmistress of the school she stepped out and was followed by her students who stood in lines behind their headmistress looking at the students of hogwarts all the students from hogwarts were watching the students with a bit of uncertainty but they were a few smiles among them one of the female students from the visiting school stood out to the whole student body as one of the most beautiful females that they had ever seen look at her harry she is beautiful i know that i have luna but she is still beautiful ron was looking at the young lady but also looking over at his girlfriend with a reassuring smile he mouthed to luna not to worry he was still hers for now and forever luna gave him a slight smile and a nod at that and stood there with the rest of the ravenclaws while mouthing to ron i know and thank you monsiour dumbledor i am madame maxine and these are my student s we present ourselves to your school for the tri wizard tournament she bowed to the headmaster and he took her hand and slightly kissed it it is our privilage to have

carriage for the duration while we re here we didntbring that many students with us and it plenty big enough we do thank you for your offer to show us around tho and accept the offer she smiled and clapped her hands telling her students in french to cast the translation charm so that they could communicate with the students and staff of hogwart s they cast the spell and then the students and staff got together for a small get together and get to know each other session chapter 85 beauxbatons spoken in french the students were looking all watching what was going on when the students went into the school for the opening get together harry noticed that there was one young lady that didntlook like she was old enough to even be in school yet but was also one of the other students sisters he could tell for they looked so much alike he walked up to the young lady and introduced himself good evening madammoiselle my name is harry potter weasley i thought that i would come over and introduce myself to the youngest of the ones from beauxbatons he smiled at the young lady who obviously didntunderstand much about what he was saying because she wasntold enough to cast the translation spell and no one had bothered to cast it on her yet harry potter the next thing that she said was in french i am gabrielle delacour good sir it is nice to meet you i of course have heard of you before and it is my pleasure to meet you she smiled up at harry and even tho the only thing that he understood was his first name he was glad that she had a smile on her face harry waved hermione over and asked you speak french dontyou mione when she answered in the affirmative he asked her to tell gabrielle here that he was going to cast the translation spell on her so that she could be able to speak to the other students hi gabrielle i hermione granger and my boyfriend here has asked me to let you know that he was going to cast the translation spell on you so you can communicate with the other students with no problem she smiled at the young lady with a genuine smile and after gabrielle nodded her head she nodded to harry to go ahead harry waved his wand over gabrielle and smiled at her as he said hello gabrielle did it work he smiled as she nodded her head and gave harry and hermione a big hug it is good to meet new friends and i hope that you will be friends with us are you the sister of one of the beauxbatons or maybe the daughter of the headmistress oh no monsieur the headmistress doesnthave any children i am the sister of the one fluer delacour she is one of the last year students from the school and was given special permission for me to come with her she is hoping to be picked as the champion of her school but there are so many others here that could also do good it doesntreally matter would you all care to meet my sister and the headmistress that would be a pleasure gabrielle when can we meet them it sounds like some of them are an interesting group maybe sometime during the time that you re here we can introduce you to some of our magical creature friends let go meet your sister and her headmistress now while we have the chance during the meet and greet harry and hermione were excited about doing this and meeting new people when they were brought before the beautiful french girl harry had to take a double take but then remembered who he was standing next to and smiled fluer i want you to meet a couple of new friends of mine this is harry potter weasley and his girlfriend hermione granger harry cast the translation spell on me since no one seemed fit to remember that i was with you guys and he was the first to come up to me to make friends harry hermione this is my sister fleur delacour last year at beauxbatons gabrielle smiled at her two new friends and was glad that they were secure enough in their relationship to be able to talk to her sister without any problems it is a pleasure to meet you monsieur potter weasley and madamemossiele granger i thank you for befriending my sister and also for casting the spell on her it isntlike we forgot to cast it on her one purpose it just that with the excitement of coming here and meeting all the other students that we forgot about it she got a far away look in her eyes then they came back into focus the next second did she say harry potter weasley are you the one who defeated the dark lord voldemort yes that was me i finally defeated him for the last time in my second year when he had used his spirit of his younger self to try to get his body back and open the chamber of secrets i see that you dontsee me as the boy who lived but as an equal madamemossielle delacour and i am happy for that i am tired of people looking at me when we first meet and looking directly at my scar and asking to see it thank you and i hope that the four of us could become friends while you are here at hogwart s he held out is hand and when she took it to shake he bent his head and kissed her knuckles instead she blushed a bit but was happy to have people around that knew manners along with being friendly she could tell that these two were soul mates and that they wouldntgo after her in anyother way than friendship she smiled and went with them to introduce her to the headmistress of her school when they walked up she said excuse me madame maxine i have two new friends that wanted to meet you before we went back to the carriage tonight this is harry potter weasley and his girlfriendhermione granger harry and hermione this is madame maxine the headmistress

school hermione said this and smiled at the older witch chapter 90 the first task getting the egg a n ok here is the first task in the tri wizard tournament i am telling you that harry is just going to be a background character during the actual tournament but will be having his own chapters that he is the main thing also this is a harry potter fiction not a tri wizard tournament fiction please read and review this is going to be an interesting tournament that i promise you there will be a few surprises donald the students were gatheres in stands out behind hagrids hut about a mile away in a clearing that none had known of before what they saw when they got there was something to behold there were three fully grown dragons and they all looked like they were guarding a nest of eggs each there were dragon handlers around each one keeping them as calm as they could harry and his friends recognized one of the handlers and waved hello when he was looking their way charlie weasley waved back to his family and their friends before quickly going back to handling the chinese fireball that he was helping out with they watched in awe as the dragons were chained at a leg each and were watched over like a hawk until the tournament started i see why they only have advanced students doing this guys i dontwant to think about what would happen to the younger students that didntknow what they were doing with dragons or whatever else that they might throw at the champions well let just watch and see what they are having the champions do this might be interesting harry was talking to his friends while having his arm wrapped around hermione waist and smiling the champions were waiting in a tent that was set off from the crowd without any windows or anything that would let them know what they were going to be facing headmaster dumbledore karkaroff and headmistress maxine were there along with minister of magic arthur weasley explaining to them what they were going to be facing in the upcoming test you will be taking a figurine out of this bag and it will show you what you are facing you will be going up against the creature and trying to get a golden egg from once you see the figurine you will know what you are facing i must assure you that these creatures are full grown and highly dangerous so i wish you the best of luck he handed around the bag for each of the champions to pull out of he clapped his hands and the figurines that they each pulled out revealed themselves cedric diggory had pulled out the chinese fireball fleur delacour had pulled out a hungarian horntail and viktor krum had pulled out another fireball as you can see you will be facing fully grown dragons and have to take a golden egg from the nest that they are guarding you can do any type of spell of other way that you can think of to get it but you cantuse unforgivables on them like it would work on them anyway good luck on this and may the best person win you will be scored on a hundred point basis on how good you do by a three person judging panel minister weasley shook hands with each of the champions and the heads of the schools before heading off to the stands to judge the contest the champions were talking with the heads of their respective schools quietly for any advice that they might be able to give them while they werentable to help in any way except to give small encouragement told them all good luck the champions waited at the entrance to the arena where they were going to be going out to face their respective dragons they had told each other good luck and waited in silence while wondering how they were each going to be doing this cedric was called first and he walked out to face the fireball that was waiting for him and he could tell that the dragons werentheld down by anything but a long chain so they wouldntgo after the other students he could tell that they were still able to fly up and have maneuverability to get at the champions he decided to try his quidditch skills to get it so he accioed his broom and took to the air being a seeker he had the quick thinking skills and the ability to fly in different directions without getting to hurt he flew around a bit and took to diving between the dragons legs and then flying up just before the dragon could bite him he tried tiring out and seeing what the dragons strategy in protecting her clutch was he watched her and noticed that no matter what he tried she wouldntfly more than 10 feet from the nest he decided that he would fly hi above her and do a move that he saw at the world cup this last summer and had been practicing ever since thank you for showing people this so well viktor i should remember to thank him for that next time i see him he flew up into a hi flight above the dragon and when he got behind her he dove down into a wronskey feint and grabbed the egg like a snitch then flew out of the way with it to the cheers of the crowd he flew off towards where the keepers were directing him to go away from the mad dragon and landed waiting for the score of the judges mr weasley was looking at the different judges and they were discussing what they were going to do about the score they were talking for about ten minutes before they came up wtih the score mr diggory that was a fine show of flying and we appreciate your use of the broom for your task we are awarding you 95 points as your score for this task and it will be kept down and added to your scores for the rest of the tasks you can join the rest of the student body to watch the other two champions go at it if you want or you can go back up to the castle mr weasley smiled as he announced this to the champion of hogwart s cedric bowed slightly to the judges and went to sit with cho to watch the rest of the champions to see what they decide to do he hoped that they did just as well as he did but not as good so he had the lead in the tournament going into the second task he smiled as he saw the next champion come out and watched as fluer delacour went up against her dragon fluer was the next one to come out and she was surprised to find that she was facing the mate to the same dragon that cedric had faced she thought she would try her veela charms on it just in case it would work she turned on the charm and walked up to the dragon and went to stroke it snout to everyone surprise the dragon let her and then let her walk past him to get the golden egg she walked over and waited for the judges decision after turning off her power after making sure she was out of the way of the dragon and smiled up at the judges very good ms delacour that was the fastest we thought that we would see that done it was an interesting use of your natural powers and we will give you 95 points for this also you may join your classmates friends or family in the stands to see how viktor does or go back to your carriage for the remainder of the day madame maxine told her that and she just smiled and joined her sister in the stands viktor krum had one of the most unusual ways of handling his dragon he went up to it and changed into another dragon and wrestled it to the ground before grabbing the egg and getting it out of the way before changing back to his own form very interesting mr krum that will be 95 points for you also you have all done good with this task and you will be informed of your next task in a couple of months now the scores are tied and it is turning out to be an interesting tournament thank you all for your attendance today you may all go back to the school now for dinner and bed headmaster dumbledore said this and all the students left for the school chapter 91 the yule ball the next day at breakfast dumbledore made an announcement that made the older students take notice he announced that there would be a yule ball this year on christmas eve and those students that would like to go both to the ball and home for christmas must let their head of house know so that things can be planned with port keys or flooing or whatever that was told to them on halloween and the friends were talking about who they were all going to be taking it was decided that they would each go with their respective partners like there was any question to that happening they had also decided that they all would go home for christmas and leave the ball early so that they wouldntbe getting home to late harry was invited to spend christmas with hermione of course and he accepted with haste they decided that they were going to be only making a slight appearance at the ball for neither of them were one of the champions but would at least dance two dances before going home the rest of the friends decided to stay until 11 in which time they were all going to be taking a port key to the burrow and have christmas there harry and hermione sent there regards to mr and mrs weasley saying that they were going to be spending this christmas vacation with her parents the group of friends took the next weekend which happened to be a hogsmeade weekend to go do their christmas shopping they decided to do all the shopping and like the previous year to have a small get together before the ball to exchange gifts they went out to a lot of different shops and harry managed to get away from hermione for a few minutes to get her the gift that he wanted to get her this year he got her a nice looking necklace along with a pair of pearl earrings to match the pearl necklace they met up at the three broomsticks for a drink and talking about what they were going to be doing for the rest of the day did you get the rest of your shopping done mione yes i got mine done how about you i got it done with the last gift that i had just gotten what shall we do for the rest of the day we re in our fourth year right and we have been going out since the summer before last wouldntyou consider us both exclusive with one another dating wise i mean yah i think that we would be considered exclusive in our dating and i happy why well i was just wondering what you wanted to do once we got out of school in three years i mean we start our owls year next year and then newts i dontknow about you but i was thinking about going into either auror or teaching maybe teach dada somewhere have you thought anything about what you want to do after hogwart s of course i have thought about it harry but i didntknow you have been thinking about it so much i dontcare what i do as long as i am around you to do it i know it might sound like i a hopeless romantic or something like that but i know already that i going to marry you one day i know a few people might think that we re to young to be thinking about that kind of stuff but i know that i love you and also that you love me so why not think about our future together i am going to keep you to your promise you made me when you gave me this ring she smiled at him and kissed him sweetly on the lips harry smiled at this and just sat there thinking that he had found the most perfect girl of his dreams she made his life and he was definitely looking forward to spending the rest of his life with her i plan on keeping that promise also mione once we graduate we are going to get married heck if it was possible i would marry you once we get done with our sixth year i dontknow what the law is like in the muggle world but in our world i think that the age of adulthood is 16 in the wizard world he smiled at her and took a drink of his butter beer well in the muggle world it 16 also i am pretty sure are you sure you would marry me while we are still in school i mean that might make a few things weird with people around the school i guess that there might have been married students before and that we wouldntbe the first so let let our families know that we are wanting to get married in the summer of seventh year she kissed him again and they walked back to the castle when the yule ball came they were all sitting in the great hall waiting for the champions to get there with their dates harry and hermione decided that they would go home after a couple of dances and the champions got there cedric and cho were the first to be announced and they entered dressed in their finest as they swooped into the hall to the applause of the students and teachers alike cedric had worn black robes with the colors of his house asa fringe around the collar and sleeves while cho wore midnight blue with silver highlights they looked great together and everyone could tell that they were in love viktor and his date came in next he had taken another student from durmstrang and they were both looking splendid in black they came into the room with a cheer and applause also they went and stood with cedric and cho waiting for fluer to get there with her date no one knew who fluer was taking to the dance but they all knew that whomever it was was a lucky guy there had been quite a few guys that had tried to get a date with her but none were able to get close enough to ask her without getting tongue tied and walking away frustrated when she walked in with her date there were quite a few gasps of surprise and awe at whom had finally got the guts to ask her out a n ok it a cliff hanger but this date of hers is a set up for later in the story dontworry you will find out in year 5 so dontworry just say that the dance went quite well and i cantgo any farther into this chapter without telling you the big secret mwahahahahaahha sorry please read and review donald chapter 92 christmas time harry and hermione landed in the front parlor of the granger home through the port key that they just took they had quite a few packages and were greeted by mr and mrs granger smiling faces as they were hugged and relieved of their packages go get some sleep you two tomorrow is going to be a big day oh and by the way it is still seperate rooms we know you two are close but not until we see at least an engagement ring on her finger harry not the little promise ring mrs granger smiled at harry and his blushing face dontworry harry we know that you are serious with our daughter but your still only 14 and we still think that that a little to young harry and hermione were hiding their embarrasment quite well and smiled at her parents they didntknow how they knew about the promise ring but they knew that harry was serious about her and they approved of him hermione was smiling widely as she led harry up to his room he has stayed there so much over the last couple of holidays that they had to make one of their other extra bedroom into a guest room because this was harry room until he and hermione got married or at least engaged she gave him a nice good night kiss and they went to their seperate rooms to sleep they both dreamed of each other that night and were ready for the next day bright and early harry woke up with the sensation of being in a waterbed even tho he was on a regular bed hermione i awake now he got up and started tickling her senseless he kissed her silly and then got up to go get a shower and get dressed he watched as hermione sat on his bed and waited for him to get back from the shower what are you doing mione i need to get dressed he raised an eyebrow when he saw that she wasntmoving what do you think your parents would say if they came in here seeing me only in a towel and you sitting on my bed we would say that we trust our daughter then ask her why she was sitting on your bed when you were in the shower when she knew you were in the shower mr and mrs granger were laughing a bit at the look on harry face when he realized that he had left his door open when he came back from the bathroom come on dear drop the towel at the look on harry face mr and mrs granger said just kidding harry we just wanted to see the look on your face when we said that now come on hermione let let harry get dressed so we can open up presents for christmas come on now young lady you have seen enough of his finely muscled figure to last you until this summer hermione blushed a bit but just smiled at harry harry had thought that he had gotten off scot free when hermione was walking out of the room but didntthink she was that close and was caught by surprise when she grabbed his towel and tugged it off of him as she went laughing out of the room nice body harry you better get dressed there was a low wolf whistle from mrs granger as harry blushed and she said dontworry harry i can still appreciate a nice young body and you definitely have a nice young body there dontworry we know that you two wouldntdo anything to disrespect our trust so we will let that little bit of play there go for now but you two better not let our trust go to waste now get dressed and come down to open your presents she gave his arse a pinch before she left the room to let the young man get dressed harry could here the three of them laughing a bit about the look that was on his face he had to admit that it was probably something funny to see and he promised that he wouldnthave their trust misplaced he was falling in love with this family as much as he loved his own parents he was definitely in love with hermione more and definitely was glad that she agreed to be with him he quickly got dressed in some jeans and a pullover shirt along with a pair of trainer before running off down the stairs and joining the family in the living room it was just the four of them this year but there still was plenty of presents harry had guessed that since he and hermione were together for over a year now that he was part of the family if not officially yet so harry got his own gifts from the family members and he had made sure that he had gotten them all something also the holidays went quite well and hermione loved the jewelry that harry had gotten her and got him some stuff for quidditch and different things that were for studying and getting ready for the upcomming owls that were starting next year all the grangers had gotten weasley sweaters from mrs weasley and they all enjoyed them immensely you have to thank her for us harry she makes quite comfortable sweaters there mr granger said this to the young man and he smiled chapter 96 third task the maze the champions were getting anxious now for there was only less than 100 points that separates first from second viktor knew that he was in last place and that it would take a miracle for him to win the tournament but was happy for fleur and cedric headmaster karkaroff wasntthe happiest with his champion but knew that he did his best he was so far behind in points he wasnteven in the running for second he was of course going to go ahead and take part in the third task for the fun of it and have fun in doing it the third task was a maze set up on the quidditch pitch and was going to be set in an all out race the person who got to the center and got the trophy wins the tournament unless of course it viktor if he get it there will be a duel between cedric and fleur to decide who is going to be the winner the third task was set to take place in the month of may and have the champions take the whole of one saturday to do this the three competitors were preparing for the different types of creatures spells pitfalls and whatever else that the person that was setting it up would throw at them they were also preparing for they knew that they were going to be going against each other and were researching spells about the different types sleep stunning or other type of binding spells that they could use viktor had decided that he would try to take the other two out as quickly as he could for even tho he couldntwin the tournament he wanted to win this part of it he decided that he would go into the maze last and follow the first person to go in then go after the other one he decided that he was going to be stunning them or putting them to sleep in some way cedric decided that he was going to try to get into the maze first and to be as quick as possible he was going to be heading towards the center of the maze in as much a straight route as possible he knew that at least one of his opponents was going to try to get to him and the other one as quick as possible and he was pretty sure that it was krum for fleur seemed at complete peace with winning this tournament he was spending the night before the final task with cho in the room of requirements having a quiet dinner and discussing what they were going to be doing with the money that he could win with this tournament he had decided that he was going to ask her to marry him when she got done in school the year after he did and that he would get the ring with the winnings of the tournament if he won he was smiling as he was making plans with her and they were sharing a nice snogging session before going to bed that night fleur was sitting in a room at one of the hotels in hogsmeade with her new boyrfriend talking about their future they werentdoing anything wrong just talking in the room he was staying in while here for the tournament she had decided that she would move to england after the end of the year when she graduated and get a job with the same place where he worked they talked a bit and snogged a bit before she said her goodnights and he led her back to her carriage in which she was staying with the rest of the students from her school he smiled as he gave her another kiss and walked back whistling an interesting tune the next day at the quidditch field found the stands full of students and the three champions sitting at the entrance to the maze wondering what was going to happen once they got inside they were getting a bit nervous and minister weasley walked up to them telling them that everything will be alright and to do their best they thanked him and started to get ready for their task ahead they each had their wands out and at the ready before they went in at the announcement from minister weasley cedric was the first into the maze followed by fleur and then viktor viktor went immediately after the hogwart champion following which way he went quite easily by the louder footfalls that he had going than fleurs he caught up to him as he had finished off a blast ended skrewt and decided to allow him to take out the critters and problems and then to make himself known and knock him out he had hoped that fleur wasntable to get to the center before they do but was willing to take the risk cedric had faced a accramantula and a couple of vampires and a boggart before seeing the cup in the middle of the maze he was about to go for it when viktor called his name and when he turned around to see what was up he was stunned out cold and the bulgarian champion waltzed up and took the cup becoming the winner of this task the three of them were immediately brought back out to the entrance and viktor was declared the winner of this task since viktor was the winner and cedric was the second closest with fleur so close behind him there is a tie for first place with viktor 100 points behind them still so it has been decided that the winner of the tournament will be decided by a duel between the two champions that are tied for first place ennervate he said over cedric and the maze was cleared away and a duelling platform was now in the quidditch pitch for the final showdown viktor took his seat up in the stands with his schoolmates to their congratulations to doing so good and their condolansces for not winning the whole thing then they all looked down and watched the unfolding drama of the final showdown duel the hogwart and the beauxbatons champions bowed to each other and the duel was on cedric was put on the defense right away having to put up shield as shield and dodging spell after spell he eventually got a tickling spell in and then a disarming spell to win the match he handed fleur back her wand and bowed to her before being declared the tri wizard tournamen champion by minister weasley the crowds went wild and he was hefted onto the shoulders of his well wishers he smiled over to his girlfriend and mouthed i love you a n ok cookies for anyone who can tell me who fleur mystery boyfriend is i will give you the only clue that would make it so that it wouldntbe obvious who it is you will find out for sure who it is before chapter 100 but let see if you can figure it out your clue he was mentioned at least one time by name in this year of the story thank you for all your reviews and keep on reading donald chapter 97 crowning the champion when cedric took fleur down in the final duel he was declared the champion and was taken back to the castle on the shoulders of his friends and school mates fleur congratulated him on a great duel and smiled sweetly at him then went to her new boyfriend for comfort the gentleman on fleur arm was kissing her softly on the well fought duel and congratulated

wedding when it happens that is as long as you two invite us to the wedding when you get around to asking her bill gave cedric a pat on the back and laughed a bit at the look of bewilderment on the look of cho cedric took bill to the side for a second as thegirls kept walking hush about that bill i know that i told you what i was going to do if i won but she doesntknow yet dontworry we will invite you two to the wedding but still got to keep it quiet until then he slapped bill on the back and they caught up with the girls when they walked up to the great hall cedric and cho were lead up to the head table where they were seated next to the headmaster and the minister of magic where he was the guest of honor and he was chatting happily with the minister and having fun he was listening

left king cross with her parents the next day they were chatting amiably about what had happened during the last school year and having laughs with mr and mrs granger about how their year had been they decided that they were going to be getting dinner out that night and had stopped at a fairly nice restaurant after stopping off at home so that harry and hermione could grab quick showers and changed into appropriate clothing for dinner that night they had a fairly nice dinner that had some good conversation and talk about what the grangers were doing now that they were back in the wizardring world well harry hermione we have been working for the ministry in the department of mysteries doing research work there is something that we need to discuss when we get back home later that might have dire consequences on your school year next year but not to worry at this time for we are having a night out and you two look like you might be a bit tired mrs granger smiled at the two teenagers that she could tell that they were very much in love and would be together for quite some time to come she couldntwait for the next four years to go by so she could start making the plans for their wedding heck if he had asked her after their fifth year they probably wouldnthave a problem with letting them get married before their sixth year or at least before their seventh year she had already discussed this with her husband knowing that they had been together for going on three years now and you couldntseparate them during holidays and he agreed with her on this they had decided that they would allow the two of them more freedom in what they wanted to do this summer and see how well they handled the adult responsibility and freedom one thing we would like to discuss with you is that we are going to be gone for a couple of weeks this summer and we have decided to let you two stay by yourselves at the house this summer it will only be for two weeks and we trust you two we are trying to see how well you two can handle adult responsibility at your age with both being alone together and with seeing how you handle it she smiled at this when she saw both harry and hermione look at each other and blush as well as smile so if i get this right mr and mrs granger you are going to trust the two of us to be left alone in your house for two weeks this summer while you two are off doing something for either work or maybe a second honeymoon harry smiled as he thought about those two going off on a vacation by themselves that right harry and you were right with your second option there we are going on a second honeymoon now that hermione is old enough to stay by herself for a couple of weeks with just someone coming in and checking on her once or twice a week dontworry it will be someone from the ministry that you both know she said that she would be glad to come in and check on you two while we were gone you two remember tonks right she was the one that you two were with during last summers vacation her and her husband charley well you two will be glad to know that they are expecting their first baby in a couple of months and she will be showing quite a bit considering that she like seven months along but dontworry she not due until well after we will be getting back dontwant you two to have to worry about her going into labor while she checking up on you just in case this happens though the floo network will be opened for you two to get her to st mungos and to contact charley to let him know they smiled at the two of them as they finished their dinners up after dinner they made their way back to the grangers spacious house in the country where they were going to be staying for the summer they were pleasantly surprised to find that they were on a lake and around 400 acres of english countryside wow i didntknow that you guys had this much acreage mione this is a beautiful place harry smiled as he said this to the three people that he was with awe well harry i didnteven know about this place it must be someplace that my parents had either picked up during the last school year or something that they have been keeping from me hermione smiled at her parents with a questioning look dontworry hermione we have been keeping this from you for a good reason we haventbeen able to come here while we were under hiding and since we have come out of hiding we have opened up this place as a summer place for the family to use there is 400 acres and we also own the lake we have around 30 horses and riding trails you will both have to pick a horse that you can ride around and if they wanted to harry your unicorn and her herd can come and live on this estate it big enough for them without them worrying about being around humans we already have a bunch of different magical creatures that have come to live on the acreage since we opened it back up we have a herd of centaurs out in the woods around back some merfolk in the lake a flock of phoenixes have nested in the trees out there also and the most interesting group that has made a home on the land is a tribe of wood elves that have taken up residence in the 200 acres of woods that you see back there they come and keep in touch and we have made friends with them they are some of the guardians of those woods and have accepted us for who we are mrs granger smiled as she had been reminiscing about who and what they were meeting over the last couple of months she knew that harry and hermione were going to love coming here during the summers and maybe come here to live once they got married she was hoping that they would get married even tho she could tell that they were meant for each other that great mum i cantbelieve that there are elves living on this land it is so beautiful and i cantwait to go riding around and swimming in the lake oh harry isntit wonderful i haventridden a horse since i was a little girl and you will love it hermione was sqealing and kissing and hugging harry as she was looking out over the property harry just held her and watched the countryside as he thought about the grangers offer about letting lightning and her herd come to live on their land he would have to talk to them when he got back to school after this summer vacation he knew that they felt that they were giving him a good idea and he was sure that the herd would love to have a wooden area of their own hey look guys there tonks waiting for us at the house entrance wow she must be having twins look how big she is way to go charley he smirked as hermione smacked him on the arm playfully at that remark she could see it also that tonks must have been having twins for she could see the size she was getting to for only being seven months along well let go and greet her so that she wonthave to come to us how long before you guys are going on your trip mum and dad we will be leaving in the morning we asked tonks to come and get herself settled in and stay with you for a couple of days before we let you on your own dontworry you wonthave much to worry about we understand that you three are friends and that she would be fine with you two around she gave her daughter a hug and they walked to the house and greeted tonks the next couple of days went well with tonks telling them not to worry and she wouldntbother them to much she did take hermione aside for a couple of hours one day to have a girl talk while charley had come over to have one with harry the two teenagers were a bit red when they next saw each other but they were well informed and smiled at each other when tonks and charley had left harry and hermione were left on their own and were sitting down to tea when harry smiled at her and bent over and kissed her the kissing got a quite heavy and they soon found themselves up in their bedroom doing what hormone crazed teenagers who were alone in a big house would do sometimes the next morning hermione was sore but smiling she and harry had a nice rest of the summer agreeing that they would definitely do that again sometime a n ok i hope that you like that chapter when i said that there
