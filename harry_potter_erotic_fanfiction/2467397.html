finally managing to secure upon the shelf she glanced hopefully up and down the hogwart express for a glimpse of her friends but her vision was obscured mainly by the immense crowds of students bustling around in search of emptry compartments ever since the beginning of august lily evans had looked forward to her return to hogwart school of witchcraft and wizardry and the escape from her bitter sister petunia evans had been extremely hostile towards her sister upon finding out that lily unlike herself had been made a witch now lily was finally going back and brimming wth happiness she set off towards the head compartment upon arriving she discovered the reserved carriage to be empty frowning slightly she settled herself upon a velvet cushioned seat and waited it wasntlong before the door slid open and in walked a person that made her stop dead and stare james potter beamed at her as he stepped in jauntily and closed the door behind him morning evans good summer he asked brightly lily emerald green eyes stared in shock at the badge pinned on his chest er was all she could manage to her annoyance james smiled even more widely congragulations head girl that excellent feeling quite irritated by his cheery demeanour she snapped ok potter fess up who d you nick the badge off of er nobody i got it through the mail honestly he added when lily continued to scowl let me see it she demanded rolling his eyes james removed his badge and handed it to her lily turned it over in her hands searching almost desperately for a sign that it was fake it cantbe you she mumbled pleadingly as she handed it back it just can t james frowned his hurt showing through his eyes look evans i know we haventgot along before but potter i donthave time for your feeble apologies just because you re sorry doesntmean i can just forget what a great fat headed troll you are her green eyes flashed dangerously and james raised his hands surrender trying to fight back his rising sense of disappointment sorry he mumbled bitterly wishing she would give him a chance whatever lily muttered her fiery temper still flaring in response to this unpleasent surprise now go and read these instructions to the new prefects i ll address the older ones and remind them of their duties james nodded glancing at the paper she passed him with disinterest look evans would you give me another chance he began but stopped at the look on lily face shaking her head with disgust lily stomped out of the compartment and hurried off to the prefect carriage 000 so how d it go prongs sirius black asked james when he returned to their compartment remus and peter looked up from their game of exploding snap to listen james groaned she wouldnteven hear me out she just called me a fat headed troll and told me to go and give the prefect their instructions sirius thumped him on the back sympathetically maybe you d better just give up on her remus suggested mildly sirius and james turned to stare at him in amazement you re kidding james said after all she put him through sirius replied nah she just playing hard to get you think so do you asked a new voice all four boys turned to look at their latest arrival there in the doorway stood cadence summers she had shoulder length coppery chestnut hair that framed her face in layers her hazel eyes surveyed james cooly you know potter you might want to leave her alone she really getting sick of you this might just be the year she snaps cadence informed him james frowned but i can t why not she asked sounding slightly more sympathetic at his dejected tone it just i can t he repeated lamely cadence frowned fine but when she finally turns you into the great slimy toad she been calling you for years dontsay i didntwarn you say cadence remus cut in quietly before james could retort why did you come down here anyways suddenly she grinned i got a letter from black this summer and seeing as it er sensitive nature i thought it best we discuss it in person sirius looked politely befuddled as he got to his feet and followed her out the door and into a spare compartment what this about he asked suspiciously i just wanted to give you my answer she replied calmly as she closed the door with a sinking feeling sirius tried to make an excuse er it ok if you dontwant to dunno what got into me he stopped arubptly as cadence placed a finger on his lips then leaning towards his ear she whispered my answer is yes sirius smiled brightly knew you d say that she grinned at his slightly sheepish expression and leaned forwards to meet his lips 000 where cadence off to lily asked her friends serena and callidora i spoke to her briefly in the hall and she said she had business to attend to she said she needed to go speak to black serena responded nonchalantly as she flipped her long wavy blonde hair over her shoulder and peered at her friend with her light greyish green eyes serena like lily was a muggle born callidora however was a pure blood and had been graced with deep blue eyes and dark almost black hair that feel to her mid back cadence their missing friend was a mixture of both bloods yes apparantly black asked her out this summer callidora added smirking lily grinned in return really i never thought black had it for her serena nodded placidly then asked so how was your summer lily oh you know alright i guess petunia finally has a new boyfriend i thought she d never get over ryan but now she dating this horrid kid named vernon you should see the size of this guy but other then the usual it was pretty dull callidora smiled

cadence strolled in her robes slightly wrinkled and her hair mussed up hey lily she said brightly as she took a seat beside her hey good summer then she replied smirking at cadence appearence excellent cadence replied breathlessly hey what the matter why are you all looking at me like that serena smiled wickedly no reason though i take it your little chat with black went well cadence blushed scarlet oh yes umm it did for a moment all the girls exchanged amused looks then burst into fitful giggles 000 where d you go padfoot peter asked when sirius had returned oh just for a week through the train james and remus exchanged curiously amused looks what was in that letter you sent cadence eh padfoot james asked trying hard to mask his laughter sirius scowled at him then decided it wasntsuch an offensive question i asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend he said without a hint of embaressment remus smiled gently and james face contrary to lighting up fell good for you mate he mumbled what d i do sirius asked catching james look remus shot him a cautionary glance as james replied nothing just wish i had your luck with girls easy for you three to say peter cut in unexpectedly you guys could get any girl in the school if you wanted except evans james muttered sulkily look prongs remus said i sure that if you give it time she might come to er like you you think

callidora and cadence at the breakfast table three bedroomed flat off diagon alley available immediatly for rent callidora made a face while cadence shook her head we dontwant something so close to diagon alley it always to busy we ll never get any sleep cadence explained throuhg a mouthful of cornflakes i hear sirius is looking for a place too calli added matter of factly what about remus and peter lily asked surprised well remus has already got a place hasnthe mrs summers informed them as she bustled over clearing away their dirty dishes and from what i hear from mrs pettigrew peter inherited a house from a great uncle or something of course james has already got his parent old place poor dear oh well lucky peter we canteven find a flat yet or even a small house cadence grumbled mrs summers shot her an encouraging look i sure you ll find something dears cadence shook her head s keptically and beckoned to the others they were all going to alice and franks to help prepare for the wedding tomorrow the three of them were considerably happier then they had been at serena funeral in fact the three of them hardly had time to dwell on it between looking for a place to live and getting ready for the wedding two days ago they had spent the whole day shopping for wizarding wedding dresses calli cadence and lily had easily found the yellow dresses alice wanted but they had remained shopping for alice dress for almost eight hours sighing at the memory lily helped herself to some floo powder and stepped into the grate she spoke the address clearly and allowed the green flames to engulf as she was transported to the soon to be longbottom residence finally you re here alice exclaimed the moment lily removed herself from the fireplace we ve still got to decorate and set up the cairs and everything lily couldnthelp but roll her eyes c mon alice we ve got all day but callidora arrived from behind her cutting off alice indignant response they all waited patiently for cadence for a moment and then set off the church was in walking distance from the house so they really didntneed to apparate franks already transferred the stuff to the church he did it late last night so no muggles would notice it all floating down the road alice chattered happily callidora smiled at her friend enthusiasm maybe one day she and briac would get married wow it really nice inside already lily exclaimed once they had entered the small brick church and the receptions going to be in the basement alice nodded vigorously as she hurried around ensuring that all the chosen decorations and flowers were there so where should we start cadence asked brightly decorating the church and reception area took almost all day using magic made it go a little faster mind you calli and alice fixed arrangements of daffodils and baby breaths all through the aisles and around the basement walls lily and cadence took it upon themselves to magic the tables into place in the basement after that they headed upstairs and began casting levitating charms on baskets full of white and yellow confetti frank showed up in the evening bringing with him a large cardboard heart which bore a just married heading the letters had been charmed to change from gold to silver to white and back had hired a few house elves from her family and friends to prepare the food for the next day but finally they finished at around ten o clock pm wow calli said breathlessly as she stepped back to admire their handiwork it looks great lily had to agree the spacious rooms looked amazing alice certainly seemed happy her eyes were teary and her cheeks a bright pink thanks so much you guys she whispered gratefully before they left after assuring her it was no big deal the girls flooed themselves back to cadence s yawning as she entered the summer kitchen she wanted nothing more then to go to bed and sleep however mrs summers hurried up to them the moment she spotted them lily proffesor dumbeldore sent an owl for you she explained handing her a large parchment envelope lily took it curiosly wondering what it could be she hurried upstairs to cadence room with her friends and tore it open dear ms evans i would be quite grateful if you would oblige to meet me at the leaky cauldron on thursday at about three o clock in the afternoon we will be using a port key from their to go to my office at hogwarts ms callidora prewett would be most welcome to attend as well but otherwise i ask that you come alone this will be a meeting of most importance so please do not go telling people about this letter please reply as soon as possible hoping you are well albus dumbledore lily gawked at it for a moment waiting for cadence and calli to finish reading it from over her shoulder cadence looked quite offended what that all about calli finally asked dunno but i suppose i should meet him lily replied feeling baffled sorry cadence hmpf i ll come with you lily calli volunteered shooting cadence a tentative look lily nodded dontworry we ll tell you all about it cady whatever when the meeting she replied huffily day after tomorrow thursday lily replied well i suppose i d better reply calli handed her an ink bottle quill and a sheaf of parchment taking it gratefully lily smoothed the paper out across cadence desk unscrewing the ink bottle lid she dipped the quill into it and set it upon the parchment poised to write dear proffesor dumbledore ms prewett and i would be most pleased to meet you on thursday at the leaky cauldron looking forward to meeting you lily evans that looks good calli said reading over lily short letter here you can borrow my owl and she strode across the room to a large cage which sat near her temporary bed she extracted a large screech owl and brought him over to lily thanks lily said as she fastened the letter to calli owl leg you ve got to bring that to proffesor dumbledore at hogwarts lily informed the owl with a low hoot the owl spread his cast wings and swooped out of the window cadence had hastened to open well we better get to bed dontwant to be late for alice and frank big day cadence said shortly nodding lily changed out of her clothes and flopped into bed she fell asleep almost immediatly but dreamt of meeting dumbledore who told her she would have to become a death eater and kill her friends she refused adamently but was turned into a horned toad she awoke sometime later with a start with no recollection of the dream whatsoever she and the other two hurriedly changed into a t shirt and pants and went down to breakfast 00000 callidora cadence and lily arrived at alice house at exactly eight o clock alice was already waiting for them looking frantic alice cadence said firmly how long have you been up since three o clock she replied meekly the teacup she held in her hand shaking violently gently lily took the cup and brought it to the sink i suppose it natural to feel nervous callidora was telling alice reasurringly looking rather peaky alice nodded c mon we ve all got to get ready alice why dontyou shower in your bathroom and the rest of us can take turns in the downstairs one lily suggested they really had to get busy the procession started at one o clock we can change into out dresses at the church again alice nodded wordlessly the three of them watched her go slowly up the stairs suddenly frank apparated into the kitchen lily jumped at the sudden noise but relaxed immediatly hey girls just arrive he asked breathlessly calli nodded good good i ve just been making sure everythings ready now if you ll excuse me i ve got to go and make the house elves are well supplied and with another pop he apparated out of the kitchen i ll shower first shall i cadence suggested brightly her frostiness from the previous night had completely melted at the prospect of this happy day after all the girls had showered they grabbed their dresses from the spare room and hurried off to the church when they arrived they found alice mother hurrying here and there setting up last minute details she was clothed in elegant dress robes of pink lily who had never seen a wizarding wedding suddenly had a thought what are the guests going to be wearing dress robes alice nodded distractedly c mon calli said kindly taking a trembling alice by the arm lets get you into that room and change lily and cadence followed her into the preparation room a feeling of excitement mounting greater by the minute the girls helped alice into her bridal gown thin shoulder straps came down into a sequined bodice part and down into a flowly skirt magically flashing opalascent flowers glimmered around the bottom of the dress once the other girls had climbed into their own gowns flowy yellow silk they began applying alice makeup lily began working with various powders and shimmers on her face while calli and cadence tackled her straight honey hair when they had all finished alice face glowed and her hair was done into a neat bun with a few yellow flowers attatched lily thought they must be a magical flower for they let off the most exotic scent do you think i making the right decision alice asked suddenly after she was done admiring her appearance of course honey quipped alice mom who had come in to help if you love him of course alice exclaimed i sure you re just feeling nervous cadence said you re taking a huge step in your life you re committing yourself to a lifetime with frank and a future with a new family alice looked positively frightened you re not helping lily muttered as she curled her dark red hair dontworry alice calli said soothingly as she took over if you love him then you know what you re doing is right alice nodded alright i ready the procession went beautifully as lily went down the aisle she shot james a dazzling smile as she spotted him in the crowd and when alice finally came down the aisle it seemed as though everyone was holding their breath her round face radiated with happiness as she and frank exchanged her vows lily couldnthelp shedding a few tears as they sealed their future with a kiss if only serena could have been there the reception afterwards was magical too alice and frank coming from pure blood wizarding families were able to have a full fledged magical party lily danced the night away with james and couldnthelp wondering if they would ever get married cadence and sirius also seemed to be having a great time a wide berth was given to them on the dance floor for they were dancing most erratically and occasionally knocking someone over the best part of the wedding was when alice and frank led the closing dance the gazed into each others eyes the entire time alice crying with happiness lily relaxed into james arms wistfully as the dance ended she couldntbelieve her best friend was finally get married to the man she loved and lily found herself realizing that she might just be falling in love as well she didnthesitate to tell james this but to her surprise james got there first i love you lily he whispered into her ear looking up she kissed him sweetly on the lips and whispered what her heart was screaming i love you

they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 11 the order of the phoenix lily yawned widely and slowly got out of bed her legs still ached from the dancing she and james had done at the wedding yesterday puffy eyed and still sluggish from sleep she proceeded to get dressed and went downstairs for breakfast cadence and calli were still asleep so she tiptoed out of the room as quietly as possible at the bottom of the stairs she greeted mrs summers and sat down at the table as she munched on a piece of buttered toast she flipped to the classifieds section of the daily prophet and began reading the classifieds section of the daily prophet cadence and callidora joined her when she was halfway through anything good calli asked as she buttered a piece of toast yeah listen to this three bedrooms flat located just outside of canterbury in a small wizarding community shop beneath owners are renting out the upstairs please contact arlene and andrew fortescue for more information cadence nodded approvingly i like the sound of that what kind of shop is beneath it she asked lily shrugged i dunno but i reckon we have time to check it out before meeting dumbledore cadence look of intrest faded and was replaced by a very sour face cadence it probably just regarding our newts or something callidora said encouragingly well whatever it not like i really care lets just focus on getting a place i want to have our own living quarters before we start work cadence replied her head held high and her voice haughty lily and callidora nodded agreeably lily wanted to begin auror training soon yet she did want to have a secure place to live before she began from what she understood it took a lot of work and was very time consuming callidora had recently been signed to the kenmare kestrels and callidora had decided she might like to work with magical creatures she was especially interested in working with hippogriffs her aunt and uncle owned a breeding farm and they were prepared to take cadence on so how shall we go calli asked looking quite excited go where asked mr summers as he strode into the kitchen where the girls were sitting we ve found an ideal place to move dad cadence replied ah i see well i dontknow much about well your type of transportation so ll leave it to you mr summers responded lightly they watched him out of the kitchen and then lily spoke up why not apparate 00000 so this is the place is it calli said casting an appraising glance at the building it was a small two level shop house with chipped blue siding and white trimming a sign over the store entrance store read a and a best wizarding robes a rickety old staircase had been build on the side of the building leading up to the housing part yes i suppose so lily replied as she glanced up and down the small street it was a small entirely wizarding street shops and a few scattered houses decorated the sides of the dusty road beside the robe shop was a small white house lily presumed belonged to the fortescue s well c mon let not stand here all day cadence said impatiently and led the two others into the small shop lily was amazed when she stepped inside it appeared as though a concealed enlargement charm had been placed on the building for the moment they stepped inside the whole appearanc changed from the outside it had looked as though only a few racks of clothes would be crammed into a small area with a low ceiling however they were now in a magnificent high ceilinged room dozens upon dozens of stands and racks were spaciously placed throughout the wide room grinning slightly the three girls approached the large oak till hello dears finding everything you need a squat witch asked beaming up at them from her small stature yes thanks we re actually here regarding your ad about the flat upstairs lily explained oh i see lovely i ll take you up there myself just let me get my husband to watch the store for a moment the witch that must have been arlene fortescue said happily andrew a tall balding man hurried out from the back at his wife call yes dear he asked surveying the girls these girls are here to look upstairs watch the store would you she replied and without waiting for an answer she snatched a pair of keys from a drawer and beckoned for the girls to follow arlene fortescue led them back outside and up the dingy staircase chatting away happily my son florean used to live here but he just got himself a place in diagon alley she said conversationally as she fumbled to unlock the door he opened up an ice cream shop no ambition at all but it does seem to be quite popular oh yes cadence said exchanging an amused look with calli and lily we ve been there and it just brilliant arlene beamed as she let them in now it not much she said modestly lily felt her jaw drop like the shop downstairs the flat seemed to also have been under the effects of an enlarging charm lush blue material carpeted the floor while white walls gleamed above them lily walked awestruck into a spacious living room which had a small window facing the street below and a large brick firepace on one of the walls across from the living room was the kitchen although slightly small it polished oak counters and stone tiled floor gave it a comfterable feel lily then followed callidora into a small hallway which broke off into three bedrooms with each their own bathroom cadence who was the most picky of them all was beaming it amazing cadence exclaimed turning to face arlene we ll take it lily and calli couldnthave agreed more lovely you re free to move in anytime you like and we ll send your monthly rent up regularly mrs fortescue responded looking relieved i hope you ll enjoy it lily nodded as she handed the keys over to calli and hurried back downstairs well that settles that cadence said brightly should we start moving in maybe tonight we ve still got to attend dumbledore metting calli responded calmly lily glanced down at her watch at this reminder and felt her stomach plumet it was already ten after three swearing she gasped sorry cadence but we ve really got to run we ll meet you back at your house later and we can begin moving in and without waiting for a response lily exchanged a look with calli and they both apparated with a soft pop 00000 lily and callidora apparated right into the midst of hogsmeade after straightening her emerald robes out lily began running down the street callidora on her heels without looking back they crossed the hogwarts grounds and dashed into the castle as they rounded the corner which held the entrance to dumbeldore office they met up with james potter and the other marauders hello james exclaimed grinning at lily surprised expression he gave her a quick peck on the lips before she opened her mouth to speak what re you doing here lily gasped completely forgetting that they were already late dumbledore wanted us to come remus replied now we d better hurry if we dontwant to be later then we already are lily glanced sideways at calli who shrugged then followed behind peter james grabbed her hand as they approached the stone gargoyle er what the password calli asked as they all stared at it blankly a new voice from behind them answered it would be sugar quills they all spun around to see dumbeldore striding towards them serenely he didntseem at all perturbed by their lateness sorry we re late lily muttered moments later when they had all climbed onto the moving staircase the gargoyle had revealed not to worry dumbledore replied his eyes twinkling i was just visiting the kitchens enjoying a cup of tea when you arrived and had lost track of time so no harm done feeling slightly bemused lily entered dumbeldore magnificent office with james by her side dumbledore conjured up chairs with a wave of his wand and gestured for them to sit down then he turned his back on them and began sorting out a few papers while they waited for him to speak sirius leaned over across james and addressed lily where cadence he hissed at home she wasntinvited lily responded then she turned to james oh and we ve found a place to move too really james replied looking pleased but he had no chance to say much else because dumbledore had just turned around to face them all now i ve called you all here regarding a very serious and important matter i wish to discuss he began looking at them from down his crooked nose you have all proven great skill when facing dark wizards on that hogsmeade trip in june and i think it is fitting that because of your abilities and trustworthiness i invite you to join the order of the phoenix the order of the what sir james asked looking politely befuddled dumebledore smiled at him the order of the phoenix mr potter it is a secret society comprised of wizards and witches like yourselves you are comitted to stopping voldemort reign of power peter fell off his chair at the mention of voldemort name and callidora gasped but otherwise a shiver of excitement seemed to resonate from lily and the others and you re asking us to join sirius asked why not cadence then i mean cadence summers dumbledore frowned slightly it is difficult and risky asking too many people to join at a time so i called upon you because you ve already proven yourselves against the death eaters i have also asked the entire group of the marauders are you called simply because they have faced er other dangers before you mean the werewolf thing lily blurted before she had paused to think callidora looked puzzled and remus shot lily a sharp look i er mean sorry i was er daydreaming calli thankfully seemed to accept this and remus visibly relaxed sorry she mouthed to him he accepted her apology with a small nod so my offer stands if you do not accept which is perfectly acceptable i will merely need to erase your memory with a mild memory charm and before you consider the issue i must tell you that by joining this society you will be placing yourselves under great risk members often have to go on dangerous missions at times and i cannot prevent the possibility of injury or even death dumbledore said seriously lily mind worked furiously if she joined she could help stop voldemort something she was going to do as an auror anyways why not join everyone is in danger whether in it or not before lily could give her answer sirius cut in who else is in the order i afraid i canttell you that not unless you join at least it too much of a possibility that a death eater could try and get the information out of you although i will be placing a memory charm on those of you who do not wish to join memory charms can be broken dumbledore replied although i think it safe to tell you your friends alice and frank longbottom have joined lily and callidora gasped they hadnthad the faintest idea well i know i am going to join james said after a moment of shocked silence me too sirius piped up his eyes shining with excitement count me in remus said quietly peter nodded m me too callidora and lily exchanged looks i think i d like to enter lily said quietly she saw james frown worriedly from the corner of her eye no you won t he said the words that came out were controlling but his voice was full of concern it my decision lily burst out angrily before she could help it i know it is it just well you could get hurt james replied indignantly ignoring dumbledore amused expression lily retorted oh and you think i dontcare if you get hurt james glared at her and lily stared back her fiery temper flaring she didntknow why his concern bothered her so much but she was a big girl i never thought i d see the day lily and james arguing about concern for each other rather then contempt sirius said dumbledore chuckled from behind his death it well oh nevermind lily spluttered her face flushing with embaressment ms prewett i think seeing as ms evans here is determined we are waiting for your answer now dumbledore said oh well i dunno calli said her cheeks going bright pink it just i dontreally feel comfterable perfectly understandable dumbledore said lily nodded to show her support she felt james shoot her another glare which she ignored well then it settled dumbeldore continued you will be notified whenever a meeting is to occur i will send word with one of the other members dumbledore then ushered callidora out of the room and told them the address of headquarters he also explained a few rules and situations to them and finally dismissed them lily james peter remus and sirius exited his office and waited for callidora to re enter she still had to had her memory modified when she finally came out they all walked down to the village of hogsemeade callidora had a slightly dazed expression on her face and didntquestion why they were at hogwarts lily figured it must have been the after effects of the spell well i ll see you all later i suppose remus said once they had reached the end of hogwart grounds callidora didntanswer but continued to stare at the sky lily nodded politely and gave james a quick hug and rather frosty kiss on the cheek see you later then she muttered avoiding his gaze he nodded and apparated following his example calli apparated as well with lily departing seconds after her lily and calli arrived outside the summers house seconds later lily checked around nervously to make sure no muggle neighbors had noticed fortunately nobody was around to witness them popping out of thin air they usually didntapparate because the summers house was located in a muggle community callidora knocked on the door then turned to look at lily where were we again she asked her eyes coming back into sharper focus lily hesitated thinking hard we just met proffesor dumbledore he wanted to make sure we were coping okay after serena death oh weird i cantreally remember calli responded but just then the door opened finally cadence explained mom just been helping me pack our stuff oh great lily said happily what about furniture well we ve still got loads from when my grandmother died so we can take that it all very nice cadence replied reassuringly as she stepped back to let them in so what did proffesor dumbledore want just to make sure we were doing okay because of well serena callidora said matter of factly lily had to stifle her laughter so callidora and lily helped cadence finish packing and then they levitated everything into the living room and to the fireplace mrs summers was all teary eyed and kept muttering things like all grown up and moving out already it seems only yesterday using a special type of floo powder the girls loaded their stuff into the fireplace in seperate loads and threw the dust down bright green flames engulfed the loads immediatly transporting them to their new house finally they were all done after a teary farewell and a handshake from mr summers the girls stepped into the now soot covered grate and using the proper floo powder set off wow lily thought we re finally starting our life as adults and this order of the phoenix thing i ll finally get a chance to help in the war against voldemort and to prevent unessecary deaths like serena s i only hope james will come to accept that i ve joined as well well i guess it begins a n thanks so much to everyone who reviewed i got a fantastic response from that last chapter and you have no idea how much it all means to me anyways here the next chapter hope you enjoy before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story

familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 12 battling ardour james awoke with a wide yawn feeling grumpy he struggled out of his covers and got dressed sirius was still fast asleep on the cot beside him i ve got to get out of this house james thought ever since the death of his parents the house had seemed cold and empty feeling rather downhearted he avoided glancing at his parents old bedroom as he stomped downstairs and out into the back yard stifling yet another yawn he hurried over to the broom shed and extracted his broomstick running a hand down it handle fondly he mounted and kicked off from the ground the weak morning sunlight beamed down on james as he rose higher and higher into the air there were no muggles for miles around so he had no need to worry about being spotted sighing as he let the relief of flight wash over him james let his thoughts turn to lily it had been nearly two months since they had joined the order and they were still rowing there had been only one order meeting so far in which they were introduced to the other members lily had avoided him for the entire time which resulted in another row the day afterwards he couldntbelieve she had joined the order doesntshe realize how much i care about her i dontwant her getting hurt but it doesntlook like i can change her mind in his frustration james flew in a few loops to let of his feelings now she mad at me james thought coming to a stand still in the air what if she wants to break up oh you ve really down it now james thought angrily oi prongs rung sirius voice from the ground james looked down to see his friend running across the yard to where he sat floating in the air his eyes were still puffy and his hair was slightly mussed up he had obviously just woken up come down here feeling slightly annoyed james flew down and touched back down lightly on the grass what he snapped there no need to take that tone with me mate sirius retorted i just wanted to know if you wanted to come out with me james surveyed his friend shrewdly why because i just got an owl saying my uncle alphard has died apparantly he left me something in his will sirius responded oh alright then arentyou upset james asked taken by surprise by this unexpected news sirius shot him a shocked glance upset my whole family was a load of well alright i guess my unlce was quite so bad but still james shrugged sorry sirius shook it off with a wave of his hand ah dontbe grinning slightly james put his broom away and they both apparated 00000 how was quidditch training calli lily evans asked as she strolled into the flat beside her two best friends callidora and cadence looked up at her entry excellent callidora responded grinning broadly the other chasers are really nice i think we all make a good team she had recieved a letter at the beginning of september telling her she had been accepted as a chaser on the kenmare kestrals and how was your first day of auror training cadence asked lily shrugged good we dontreally get to do much at first it mostly studying and later we ll start taking our aptitude test and stuff alice is in my training group too frank already a year up well that alright then cadence responded more exciting then training those feather brained hippogriffs cadence said moodily ever since she had learned she was not going to be able to become an auror she had looked for a job where she could work with animals she had finally found an opening last week on her aunt and uncle hippogriff farm i would ve thought you d enjoy working with hippogriffs callidora piped up well it not so bad i guess cadence replied with a shrug today one of our females gave birth to a little baby hippogriff he so cute i even got to name him lily and calli exchanged bemused looks they both knew cadence really did love her job and what d you name him lily asked buckbeak cadence replied promptly beaming around at them and he taken a special liking to me too cool calli said smoothly oh by the way lily alice and frank stopped by earlier they say there another meeting tonight oh great lily responded nervously surveying her friend um did they tell you er why yeah she said it had to do with auror training cadence spoke up lily relaxed she was of course actually going to an order meeting only her friends couldntknow that since callidora had refused to join and cadence wasntinvited lily had often wondered why callidora hadntjoined perhaps it was because she had never been exactly skilled in duelling which is why she never expressed an intrest in becoming and auror or perhaps it was merely because she couldntstand the stress of being at so much risk well it was her choice and lily respected that if only james would respect her decision well i suppose i d better get going then hadnti lily asked snapping out of her reverie it probably just our erm stealth project cadence and calli nodded have fun they chimed together lily waved at them cheerily and apparated to headquarters 00000 hey lily alice exclaimed happily when she arrived hey lily responded distractedly her green eyes had immediatly fallen on james who was chatting with remus sirius and peter scowling she turned back to her friend who had just been joined by her husband lily frank greeted her warmly and extended his hand lily shook it then asked hey do you know why we re here alice smile faded no we re all waiting for proffesor dumbledore to tell us but he seems really worried she replied looking distinctly concerned frank put his hand on her shoulder and opened his mouth to add his opinion but just then dumbledore entered the small room in which they stood welcome everyone now i afraid i have grave news i was owled this morning by an anonymous death eater who threatened a mass muggle killing unless i resign from my post of headmaster at hogwarts he announced loudly his lined face seemed to be even more creased then usual several people gasped quietly at this pronouncement now i have been working all day with a few people from the ministry and we reckon we have a good idea of where they are planning to strike seeing as i will not step down and where is that sir james called from the corner where he and the other marauders stood dumbledore bowed his head slightly well i believe they are intending to kill several muggle families nearby i have called you here to ask you to join me in this dangerous mission of stopping them lily felt a wave of fear and excitement wash over her please sir a small witch who lily knew to be named dorcas meadowes piped up do you think they are planning on using giant influence or anything else we re not sure dumbledore replied but we must hurry anyone who is willing to ome please come forwards all twelve or so members that were there stepped forward lily moved forwards to join them when she suddenly felt someone grab her arm what she asked james brusquely wrenching her arm from his grasp i dontwant you going he replied icily lily felt the color rising in her face well unfortunately for you it not your decision james scowled at her please lily this is a really dangerous task we re setting out to do i couldntstand it if you got hurt again james i just as competent as you or maybe you re so thick headed you think your better then the rest of us lily responded venemously james seemed to deflate before her it not that he protested but lily turned her back to him and marched forwards to join the staring crowd angrily james kicked the wall and stormed back to his friends who were also waiting ready then dumbledore asked his eyes twinkling there was a gradual assent of nods and he handed around a few port keys lily took hold of an old rag sandwiched between alice and a man nick named mad eye moody one two three lily felt the peculiar feeling of travelling by port key hit her before her feet were jerked from the ground and was surrounded by a whirl of color seconds later he feet slammed into the ground and she toppled sideways into alice frank caught his wife the shoulders but lily felt painfully to the ground looking up she saw the other groups of order members arrive from thin air beside them the marauders and dumbledore included shhh dumbledore whispered his glasses flashing in the moonlight lily took frank offered hand and he helped her up a hushed silence seemed to have fallen about the group now listen here dumbledore whispered urgently as he turned to face them all we ll all split up and stand guard at odd intervals around the street try not to look conspicuous around any muggles okay and if you see any death eaters send a message by the regular way and fend them away from the muggle houses lily and the others nodded a weird sortof of excited fear seemed to be flowing through her veins now mr and mrs longbottom alastor and ms evans you go and wait at the end of the street remus james peter sirius and dorcas you go and station yourselves in the alley behind the houses the rest of you come with me to the other end of the street dumbledore whispered everyone nodded and shuffled off hurriedly to their stations lily hastened to follow behind moody alice and frank followed closely in her wake fortunately the street seemed to be quite deserted now be very quiet moody growled alright lily muttered in response as they reached their designated look out spot her stomach churning lily peered into the darkness her hand inside her pocket clenching the handle of her wand she could hear alice quick scared breaths beside her moody and frank stood quite motionless except for the frantic turning of their heads squinting slightly lily could just make out dumbledore group at the other end of the street suddenly an idea occured to lily maybe we should conceal ourselves a bit more she said timidly mad eye moody turned to look at her his small beady eyes seemed to be summing her up good idea he finally growled i can see why dumbledore invited you to join the order flushing lily moved with the others behind a muggle vehicle what that alice whispered sounding alarmed they all paused nobody dared to breath sure enough lily could hear the gentle rise and fall of footsteps moody slipped his wand out from his cloak pocket and the others followed his example a paralyzing sort of fear now become to over come lily shaking slightly she looked around nervously her eyes scanning every inch of darkness for a sign of the enemy there she heard moody breath lily took in a sharp gasp of air only metres in front of them walked ten or so hooded death eaters on three stunners frank whispered to the group at large one two three stupefy lily cried her voice drowned amongst the others it seemed the death eaters were expecting an ambush for they all managed to block the curses in the brief moment before lily became lost in battle she saw several more cloaked figures on dumbledore end we re out numbered she exclaimed horror rising within her nobody answered and lily had to duck to avoid a flash of green light impendimenta she shrieked aiming her wand at a very tall death eater the figure was blasted backwards off his feet and lily took the chance to stun him while he was distracted lily look out she heard alice scream from somewhere behind her protego lily gasped causing the red beam of light which had been inches away from her to be deflected thanks dodging and occasionally sending out hexes lily managed to break away from the throng of wizards we need help she muttered as she gasped for air summoning up the happiest memory she could think of she whispered expecto patronum a silvery cat formed from the silver mist she had just emmited from her wand she watched briefly as it sleek body hurried off towards the dark alley she had sent it to fetch james and his friend in the alley tarantallegra a female death eater voice sounded fro under her hood lily whipped around and got hit full blast with the spell instantly her legs jerked into a crazy sortof of tapdance she tried to aim a curse at her attacker but do to her frantic movements she couldnttake aim lily watched in panic as the witch raised her wand again avada keda just then james hurtled out of nowhere and threw his full weight at the woman remus hurried towards lily an muttered the counter curse thanks lily breathed he nodded briefly and hurried off into the battle at the other end of the street lily saw that dumbledore had managed to subdue his group of attackers and was now hurrying towards them many of the death eaters at lily end seemed to notice this as well for they all began apparating with small pops good job dumbledore panted as he arrived at their end is everyone alright i think so sirius replied as he got up from where he had fallen on the road lily scanned the group several of them looked a bit worse for where but mostly everyone seemed alive and mobile frank was sporting a bloody nose moody was nursing several large gashes on his arm and dorcas meadowes had a large lump swelling on top of her head but otherwise everyone was okay you all fought well and i thank you i think we ve managed to protect these muggles for now dumbledore told them calmly they wonttry anything after that you may go home now they all nodded gravely and soft cracks filled the night silence are you alright lily asked striding towards alice and frank yeah we re fine you alice asked wearily fine well i expect we ll be seeing you soon then frank said take care lily bye lily responded softly as the two of them dissapparated with a large crack then hearing someone quiet breathing behind her she whirled around oh james you scared me lily gasped he smiled weakly sorry that okay lily replied not quite meeting his eye oh and thanks for saving my life no problem look lily i m james began but lily interrupted him it okay i sorry i got so mad james smiled even wider i love you he whispered wrapping his arms around her i love you too lily responded and leaned forwards to meet his kiss a n sorry about taking so long to get this up it just school starts for me tomorrow so i ve been really busy getting

shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 13 dates and danger i think it brilliant cadence exclaimed late one evening alice frank james lily callidora peter cadence and remus were all visiting sirius in his new place he had bought a small cottage type house with the money his uncle left him in the will sirius beamed at her and kissed her briefly on the lips so i guess we re all really getting on with our lives hey callidora smiled as they all lounged on the sofas alice and frank are married we re all working or looking for work and we finally have our own places yeah lily replied from where she was sitting with james so much has changed since last september you dontsay remus commented you still loathed james at that time lily smiled reminiscently yeah i did we ve come a long way then haventwe james smirked causing lily to smack him playfully on the arm if only serena was here calli mumbled there was an awkward pause of silence well lily calli we d better get going we ve all got to work in the morning cadence said briskly interrupting the uncomfterable silence lily nodded and got to her feet want me to come with you james asked hurrying to fetch her coat oh i think i can manage lily replied back tauntingly they kissed again ignoring their friends amused faces well see you then cadence told sirius pecking him on the lips alright bye calli called waving the marauders all bade them goodbye and the girls stepped outside see you at the house cadence called and with a pop she disappeared following her lead lily and calli mimicked her and apparated back to their flat 00000 i back lily called happily as she stepped out of the stone fireplace the following day she had had quite a load of homework to bring home and had flooed home seeing as it was more difficult to apparate with objects lily cheery smile disappeared as she spotted callidora curled up on the couch he eyes red and puffy what the matter lily asked alarmed as she put her books on a table and sat down beside her friend b briac was cheating o on me calli wailed burying her face with her hands he was going to come a and visit me at practice t today but he cancelled because he s said he was sick so i decided to pop by his place and he was t there with another girl oh calli lily exclaimed distraught i m so sorry w w what wrong with me calli sobbed to her hands lily wrapped her arms around her tear sticken friend nothing wrong with you it him whose got the problem dirty cheating troll headed scum lily finished viciously calli looked up tearfully at lily r really yes you re ten times better then any girl who helps a guy cheat on his girlfriend lily responded firmly now lets go and get you cleaned up after lily had helped calli change out of her quidditch robes and helped her re apply her makeup she hurried around to make supper cadence arrived home half way through the proceedings and pitched in it wasntlong until the girls had managed to make themselves a nice meal and sit down to eat it lily explained to cadence about what had happened with calli earlier while they were busy washing the dishing with magic cadence swore venemously i know i think she ll be better now but still lily said once she had explained the entire thing callidora was wiping down the table yeah i suppose you know when she a bit better about the whole thing we should try and set her up with someone cadence said thoughtfully cadence i sure she can find a date herself lily exclaimed taken aback by her friend mischievious scheming yeah but maybe not a decent one look at what just happened cadence said carelessly lily pondered the idea for a moment i guess maybe she said slowly cadence face split into a wicked smile now i was thinking how about remus lupin 00000 james remus sirius and peter sat that afternoon infront of florean fortescue ice cream shop each of them slowly licked their ice cream cones savouring each of their unique falvours sirius had taken a dare and was licking one flavoured ketchup and caramel with a look of utmost disgust on his face you are a git james potter a real git he grumbled you accepted the dare james replied grinning broadly and if you really want i suppose you could just throw the rest away sirius shot him an annoyed look oh and just forfeit the five galleons not a chance remus and peter sat on either side of the squabbling pair gazing at sirius half finished desert with disgust so what are your plans for tonight prongs peter asked finally taking his eyes off the revolting ice cream well i was thinking james said casting a furtive glance at sirius and remus that we all do a bit of double dating or triple or quadruple or whatever remus looked at him warily what exactly did you have in mind he asked supiciously james shrugged and answered non chalantly well i thought dinner maybe at that new wizarding restaurant you know i could go with lily and sirius with cadence then you two he gestured at remus and peter well one of you can go with callidora and i sure the girls can grab another friend then of course we could invite the longbottoms sirius stopped licking his ice cream for a moment and looked up with intrest i all for it he announced peter considered it for a moment he had only ever had a few girlfriends in the past probably only because of his friendship with the marauders but he thought he might like to give it a go alright but i not going with calli do you see the look on her face every time she looks at me peter finally answered well maybe if you hadntretched all over her that time in third year remus said sharply james grinned so how bout it moony he asked i sure you and calli will get along remus flushed unnoticeably oh i suppose he muttered reluctantly great james exclaimed i ll owl the girls tonight they all nodded in agreement except for sirius who blurted angrily fine james i give up he chucked his ice cream into the rubbish bin here your galleons 00000 cadence you and james didntset this up did you lily asked in a low voice as all the girls got ready for their group date she had just changed into her best emerald green dress robes and was fastening her hair in an elegant bun well i might ve had word with him about it cadence replied besides it ll do calli some good to get out lily opened her mouth to reply but was deprived of the chance when callidora voice rang out from the front room marlene here alright cadence called back hastily the girls had invited marlene to go with peter she hadntbeen thrilled at the prospect but cadence eventually persuaded her with her pronounced gift of convincing people hey marlene lily said as she stepped out of cadence room where they had been preparing thanks for coming ah dontworry hey have you heard from the ord marlene replied but stopped abruptly at lily warning gaze orowen brothers marlene finished feebly fortunately callidora and cadence were too busy locking up to notice the suspicious mid sentence change ready to go callidora called as she tapped the front door locks with her wand they all nodded then here we go cadence said and apparated the others right behind her 00000 this is nice lily said happily as she cast an appraising glance over the wizarding restaurant she had her arm hooked with james and they were leading the other pairs upon further inspection lily noticed the odd assortment of guests three middle aged witches were conversing in a heavy irish accent at a corner table a couple dressed in all purple robes were chatting animatedly against the far wall and what looked like a group of veela and their dates sat elegantly at a wide table in the midst of the restaurant the restaurant itself was magnificent highly polished oak table and chairs were stationed spaciously around the room and various portraits decorated the high walls most of them seemed to feature gorgeous unicorns or beautiful mermaids a table for oh my exclaimed a witch waitress hurrying to seat them quite the large lot you ve got here yeah james said grinning broadly a table for ten it is right the witch replied and she whisked out her wand with a swift wave she magicked two tables to converge providing the appropriate seating this way please they all followed her as she led them through the maze of booths and to their designated table lily sat down between james and sirius remus and callidora took seats opposite then they all ordered their drinks and the flustered looking waitress bustled off nice isntit cadence commented surveying the glass paned ceiling the clear starry ngiht sky beamed above them it still not as beautiful as you sirius whispered audibly into her ear and kissed her cheek cadence blushed slightly giggling across the table lily saw calli shift in her chair nervously remus was also looking distinctly uncomfterable so lily said in an attempt to ease the tension she could see marlene sitting as far away from peter as possible from the corner of her eye it feels so weird not to be at hogwarts remus seized the subject gratefully i know it odd not having to do homework every night for a change speak for yourself alice grumbled from the end of the table where she was sitting with frank lily frank and i are kept on our toes with the amount of work auror training giving us tough is it sirius asked yes frank replied we re still learning all sorts of things they never taught us at hogwarts lets see you try and master the sound muffling charm in three hours hey i ve been busy myself sirius retorted though there was no trace of anger or annoyance in his voice i ve been doing a lot of paper work for st mungos you re working for st mungos lily asked raising her eyebrows she had never pictured him doing an office job sirius blushed and muttered something about waiting for something better what ve you been doing remus calli asked attempting to make conversation with her date oh i ve just been er working on files and speeches about er magical creatures and stuff remus studdered nervously lily knew he meant werewolves and taking pity on him she decided to rescue him from these dangerous waters well like we said the other day it seems were all fully into the adult wizarding world now she explaimed remus gave her a thankful look hear hear cadence said the rest of the night passed safely remus and calli were waming up to each other steadily and he even kissed her good night before they went home well i think that went well cadence exclaimed as they arrived back at their place you and remus certainly seem to be getting along calli callidora blushed slightly yeah you know he really is a nice guy 00000 peter slunk away miserably after his date with marlene they had hardly spoken the whole time and their only short bits of conversation were simple statements such as pass the salt please or have you tried this pasta yet what wrong with me peter thought angrily as he strolled up the deserted street leaving his friends and date behind how come james and them are so popular but i not he muttered angrily in his mood he had decided to walk home in order to vent some of his feelings it because they dontrespect you a voice hissed from the alley he was now passing w w who there peter called nervously backing away in panic just me a soft voice hissed i ve come to see if you ve thought any more of my propostion rosier peter said in a low voice well the voice persisted and a hooded and masked wizard stepped out from the darkness i i thought i told you back then peter said in an attempt to be bold but failing miserably come now the dark lord can offer you more respect and rewards then your so called friends come to his side and you will have much more then you do know including the respect of many pure blooded witches the death eater called rosier persisted y yeah but what about m m my friends peter asked warily the man let out a raspy laugh friends if they re really your friends then why are they the popular ones they ve never bothered to help you have they didntyou say that night before christmas that they were always embaressing and teasing you rosier asked his voice was so quite it sounded like a mere hiss peter considered this for a moment you re right he said slowly so are you in the man asked his eyes glinting in the shadow y yes i am peter said making up his mind he would show those so called marauders that he was just as worthy of respect as them author note whew today was my first day of grade nine and i have to say i surprised i had energy to write this anyways i hope you all like it and just in case you didntpick up on it that night sirius and cadence had been on hogwarts ground was the night peter first met with the death eater rosier anyways please review and tell me what you think before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 14 call of the wolf autumn passed in a colorful blur and winter arrived bringing with it icy winds and heavy snow lily was really being kept on her toes now for besides working for the order which had suddenly become more frequent as voldemort steadily gained even more power and auror training she had to worry about security measures new charms and protection jinxes were being advertised and recommended on a daily basis the girls had all been doing as much as they could to make themselves less of a target and their flat as safe as possible callidora had gone to great lengths to get her father who worked for the ministry to come and place an anti apparating charm on their place we dontwant to make it any easier for the death eaters you know she told lily and cadence quietly as they offered their hospitality to mr prewett as he placed the spell lily had to agree attacks seemed to have doubled in the last couple of months callidora dad for example had lost two of his cousins the other day to death eaters incidentally gideon and fabion prewett were also in the order of the phoenix besides that the girls were finding it hard to find time to spend with their boyfriends callidora and remus had begun to go out but anyhow lily was hardly surprised when alice and frank arrived at the front door late one evening announcing to her that another urgent order meeting was being called for immediatly fortunately callidora was at a late quiddtich practice and cadence was visiting her parents and the worst part is dumbledore cantcome because we have reasons to suspect that their using this latest attack as a diversion while another group attacks hogwarts frank informed lily as she hurried to get her cloak after scribbling a note to calli and cadence lily followed the longbottoms out of the door breathlessly and quickly tapped the lock behind her ready alice asked as they reached the bottom of the old stairs with a nod lily apparated james was waiting for them on the corner of the street where headquarters were located lily c mon they re waiting he said distractedly taking her hand and leading her towards a shabby old buillding only members were able to see it therefore making in safe from outdiers or enemies james led her inside the building alice and frank behind them they were greeted by a very small crowd only marlene mckinnon elphias doge and the marauders were there where is everybody lily asked eyeing the small group apprehensively she did not fancy taking on a lot of death eaters or whatever it is they had to do with their miniscule number alice seemed to be thinking along the same lines for her mouth was hanging open as she counted everyone well dumbledore obviously at hogwarts and we sent dorcas and emmeline to help him unfortunately we were unable to get a hold of any of the others the wizard elphis doge wheezed james blinked well shouldntwe wait until more people join us no we have to go now we think they re planning on attacking a muggle born witch and wizard just outside of hogsmeade marlene cried alright then we should set off at once lily said quietly it was true she had a bad feeling about their odds but they couldntjust leave their fellow wizards to face the enemy by themselves james put a comforting arm around her waist lily smiled at him weakly remus who was looking very woe begone nodded let go with that everyone followed him to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of floo powder one by one they stepped into the sooty grate and departed for some reason peter looked extremely nervous when his turn came he was chewing his nails in a way that resembled a small rodent and he kept shooting furtive glances at the others stepping over the hearth rug peter entered the fireplace and muttered something under his breath did you hear what he said i think he said the name wrong sirius asked frowning as peter was whisked away by the emerald flames they were supposed to be flooing to the three broomsticks i dunno james said indifferently you know wormtail he not that bright he probably forgot where we were going and landed himself at the leaky cauldron instead sirius looked pacified and he too was soon gone the longbottoms left next and next moment it was their turn james offered lily the fireplace first and she whirled away in the green flames lily stepped of the three broomsticks fireplace with a small cough upon straightening up she saw that madam rosmerta had come downstairs to see what the commotion was she was still clad in her night dress and looked quite frightened dumbledore said you might be popping in everything okay she was asking elphis doge lily didnthear the answer for just then james came flying out of the fireplace hello he said brightly adjusting his glasses nobody answered but they quietly proceeded out the doors leaving behind a very anxious land lady behind remus and elphias led the way talking in low serious whispers lucky it a cloudy night you ve taken your potion yes of course they led them up the dusty roads of hogsmeade past the shops and to the shrieking shack lily winced as she looked at the trees beyond the memory of the battle there in june stabbed at her like a knife it not too far from here remus whispered breaking her from her thoughts are you okay lily lily nodded mutely she knew she must be quite pale from nervousness the group walked in silence for another quarter of a mile following an old winding road past the shack we should probably all disallusion ourselves james suggested when they had reached the spot a small stone cottage sat on the long grass directly ahead of them lily tapped the top of her head and murmured the enchantment she was suddenly doused with the feeling of an egg being cracked on top of her head everyone copied her should we wait outside or barge right in sirius asked eyeing the small residence of the two muggle bornes with great trepidition go right in i suppose but we best be on our guard marlene mckinnon whispered back to him everyone with me there was a gradual assent of agreement lily walked up the stone cobbled pathway as quietly as she could just beside her walked james and before her was alice and frank there was an unbearable atmosphere of tension around the group everyone stopped before the door looking quite uncertain should we er knock frank asked breaking the tense silence no we want the element of surprise remus whispered back we can always explain to the couple if they arentalready well er he let his voice trail off anxiously and to make up for his unfinished sentence he tapped the lock and muttered alohomora holding her wand aloft lily stepped in warily fortunately everything seemed to be in order a startled looking witch and wizard emerged from the kitchen looking around nervously hello the man called they all quickly undid their dissalusinment charms mr yerwut alice asked uncertainly we ve recieved a tip off that death eaters are going to attempt to attack you tonight we re here to stop them but firstly we need to make sure it is really you umm elphis you know the yerwuts right elphias noddedd ignoring the couples panic stricken faces what is your dearest ambition he croaked his wand still ready for use but we ve been keeping it a secret mrs yerwut wailed cantyou ask another question you d better answer it or we attack james snarled suspiciously mr yerwut gave his wife an encouraging nod okay okay we ve been dreaming of opening our very own branch of apothecaries she said reluctantly a scowl painted her blonde framed face it them elphis announced confidently nice to meet you lily said holding out her hand the others followed suit so have you noticed anything suspicious tonight sirius asked as mr yerwut released his hand no we ve just been up waiting up there supposed to be a meteor shower tonight you know mrs yerwut answered she seemed to have warmed up to them considerably i afraid you wontbe able to watch it tonight frank replied gently like we ve said the death eaters oh right mrs yerwut said looking crest fallen well i guess you ll need to be staying then to keep watch lily watched her intently she couldntunderstand why mrs yerwut wasntshowing much fear if it was her she d be terrified yes that right james replied alright can i offer you all to a drink then mr yerwut asked siirus opened his mouth to accept but remus cut across him sharply ye no thanks we ll need to station ourselves at every entrance and keep guard i trust you have an anti apparating spell on your household mr yerwut nodded well lets split up then marlene suggested remus you and peter can take guard against the front windows remus jumped umm no i ll take the back door thanks james and sirius exchanged a meaningful look and lily felt something click in it the full moon okay marlene continued looking harried lily and i will take the windows then james you and sirius should wait upstairs and elphias alice and frank can do the front door everyone hastned off to their stations without further complaint lily and marlene took the front windows in the sitting room and were soon joined by the yerwuts so you re all aurors then mr yerwut asked eyeing them with mistrust and how do we know that you arenthe death eaters lily who had been peering anxiously throught he blinds looked up irritably if we were dontyou think you d already be dead she spat mr yerwut fell silent minutes later their watch was interrupted again what is it this time lily snapped whirling around nothing nothing i was just saying it such an inconvient night for this to happen i mean that meteor shower was supposed to be really good we bought new lunascopes and everything mrs yerwut sighed not looking remotely abashed and lily outburst and how do you expect to watch it with all this cloud marlene replied imperiously before lily could retort oh but didntyou hear it supposed to clear up around now mrs yerwut exclaimed completely oblivious to lily and her husband who were now staring daggers at one another rolling her eyes lily turned back to look out the window all thoughts erased from her mind as she concentrated on doing her duty two mintues passed three minutes five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes of silence has fallen while the women watched out the window the yard was suspiciously empty lily was just adjusting her position when she heard the door creak open she whirled around with alarm drawing her wand and just about screamed when she saw mrs yerwut standing at the front door lunascope in hand alice frank and elphias were unconcious behind her it looked as though she had stunned them what do you think you re doing lily raged marlene joined in too looking irate we re giving up our rest to protect you but mrs yerwut seemed unaffected by their yells she didnteven look up when james sirius remus and peter abandoned their posts and hurried to where she stood looking alarmed what happened remus asked in alarm as he skidded to a halt nearly knocking mrs yerwut off her feet mr yerwut remained on the couch a look of amusement spread lazily across his face none of them took any notice to sirius who was now reviving the others we were just trying to find that out lily hollared still glaring at the ignorant woman how dare she we re putting our necks on the line lily would have went on yelling but at that moment she felt and odd draughty feeling brush past her legs she looked down confused hey come back here sirius yelled her head snapping back up lily saw the mrs yerwut the foolish witch had taken off at a run into the yard distantly yelling about wanting to see the shower she was soon out of firing range before they could think to stun her c mon james shouted leaping up the others including the ones who had been stunned followed right on his tail mad old woman sirius muttered as they tore back down the cobbled path his head flicking from side to side as he watched for death eaters oh no not again lily heard marlene scream from behind them looking back lily saw mr yerwut streaking off in the opposite direction marlene peter alice frank and elphias changed direction and tore after him instead lily remained with remus sirius and james finally they caught up with mrs yerwut james and sirius each took one of her arms firmly wow she breathed wearing a blank expression as she stared up at the sky following her gaze lily looked up and it took a moment to realize what she was seeing the clouds were now parting and behind them revealed a large glowing completely full moon merlin no james breathed from somewhere beside her almost in slow motion they turned to look at remus have you taken your potion sirius asked plainly horrorstruck remus stepped back trying to avoid falling into the moonlight y yes alright then you ll be fine although it ll be just as painful right sirius asked lily shot him a reproachful look remus turned to go back in the house but it was too late the moonlight finally cast him out of shadow his limbs began shaking violently and lily felt a stab of pity she took a few steps back and held james tightly as the transformation began mrs yerwut was staring at remus with a dazed look lily didnthave the emotion to spare for her or wonder about her lack of shock it okay lily james crooned into her ear as he held her tight in an embrace the wolfsbane potion was invented in july and ever since remus has been taking it it ll be hard on him but he wontbe violent lily could only nod imagining the terror poor remus had to face every full moon suddenly a thought struck her ignoring remus howls of pain as his feet began to elongate she looked up at james how come he didntmorph before this the potion also refrains the victim from transforming unless he is subjected to moonlight he replied calmly though his face was twisted with revulsion c mon we should get moony inside lily let go of him and watched as james and sirius now approached the hunched figure of a tall werewolf lily watched blankly as james approached him she had completely forgotten about why they were there and about mrs yerwut suddenly the werewolf snarled at sirius both men recoiled moony james said uncertainly your potion but the wolf made no sign that he even recognized james was speaking with another blodd curdling growl it lunged james dodged just in time but not before the werewolf spun around again reflecting hazily on the information she had learned years ago about the werewolf responding only to the call of it own kind lily did her best imitation of a howl awooooooooooo remus now the werewolf turned in confusion he had been about an inch from sinking his cursed fangs into james snarling and foaming at the mouth he ran towards lily who turned on her heel and ran as fast as she could wishing that the houses in hogsmeade didnthave anti apparating charms on their yards as well just as a loud growl prickled at the hairs on the back of her neck the heavy pawsteps softened swinging around lily felt her jaw drop distracting remus was a magnificently antlered stag and a large bear like dog james sirius lily called her confusion mounting as adreneline pounded through her veins where d you go and where are they from lily watched frozen to the ground as the werewolf centimetres in front of her growled threateningly at the two animals the dog let out a deafening back and leapt at remus lily didntknow what to do should she stop it from hurting remus or let it save her and where did james and sirius go how could they just desert her in her panic striken shaky confusion she didntnotice that the stag had just transformed into a man and not just any man james she shrieked what who how james ran towards her hurriedly lily i ll explain later get yourself away from here go and find the others take mrs yerwut and be careful okay watch out for death eaters james said firmly lily opened her mouth to protest but just then the black dog let out a loud yelp without further ado james turned back around and transformed into a stag mouth still hanging open it took a moment for lily to remember james words grudgingly she tore back towards mrs yerwut who was humming bizarrley under her breath c mon you stupid woman she grumbled seizing her arm looking back on the surreal scene behind her the silvery werewolf being held in check by the stag or james and the black dog she assumed must be sirius lily dimly wondered why mrs yerwut wasntputting up a fight as she had earlier lily half dragged mrs yerwut back to the house closing the door softly behind her she felt with a pang of horror someone ragged breathing on her neck slowly she turned and looked through the two holes of a mask into steely grey eyes a n i wanted to leave you all on a bit of a cliffhanger sorry if this chapters a bit confusing the next one will make it clearer i know the whole werewolf wolfsbane potion thing is a bit confusing but j k rowling didntgo into detail so i felt the liberaty to invent well i hope you all enjoy please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 15 meeting of cursed fangs lily felt her heart constrict with terror and her limbs her left hand she still clutched mrs yerwuts sleeve and in her right hand she loosely held her wand in one swift movement the death eater snatched it away where are the others she finally croaked with fear invading every syllable of her words the death eater let out a low unpleasent laugh oh they re right there he gestured at the sitting room where marlene elphias and peter lay on the floor gagged and bound with ropes except your longbottom pals the dark lord is dealing with them upstairs he hissed stepping aside without his cloaked body blocking the way she finally got a full sight of their predicament beside her tied up friends stood three more death eaters two more were perched on the stairs and to her outmost horror mr yerwut was standing proudly with the group of death eaters mr yerwut wha lily croaked he let out a loud amused laugh no mark yerwut is already dead i killed him last night but if you wish to see my true identity just wait for the effects of polyjuice potion to wear off he replied calmly lily stared at him fear flooding her senses this cannot be happening the death eater in front of her suddenly waved his wand and thick black ropes wound their way around lily panickedly she struggled against her bonds but it was no use she now had no choice but to join her friends on the floor she opened her mouth to speak to marlene whom she was laid beside but with another wave of his wand the death eater gagged her choking silently lily craned her neck upwards to look at the death eater impersonating mr yerwut she watched her whimpers muffled as slowly mr yerwut face melted away and was instead replaced by the gaunt face of rodolphus lestrange lily immediatly recognized his face from the ministry posters that had been posted everywhere beside her she felt marlene and elphias struggle against their bonds peter remained quite still let her speak the death eater rodlphus commanded one of the others waved his wand and lily felt her gag disappear choking she addressed him as he loomed above her his wand pointed lazily at her head but we checked if you were death eaters when we first came we asked what your dearrest ambition was lily blurted all of the death eaters laughed at this comment lily felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end i know you did you foolish mudblood but meritha yerwut was herself and she kindly answered for us one particularly large death eater responded raspily then why is she acting so odd now she hasnta clue what going on anymore lily could only think to keep them talking that was me rodolphus lestrange spoke up i put her under the imperious curse while you were all standing guard and of course you wouldntexpect me because you all thought i was still that mudblood man lily groaned how could this happen suddenly a heart stopping scream sounded from upstairs to her sickening horror the death eaters exchanged looks of glee devoid of questions lily lay there helplessly on the floor she could think of no way to escape or to warn james and sirius not to come in sighing hopelessly she watched as several moments of silence passed she knew they must be waiting for voldemort to finish so he could torture lily and her friends next how come you know who is torturing f f frank and alice lily asked smally the grey eyed death eater surveyed her in slight surprise dontyou know mudblood the dark lord takes pleasure in killing those on dumbledore side and our rumoured attack on hogwarts was just a diversion we merely wanted less of you to come to make you more vulnerable but you should know that the dark lord often takes place in our tortureand murder raids after all you faced him in june he said coldly lily felt as if she had recieved a blow to the head what she gasped he was the only one who didntflee when dumbledore arrived he attempted to kill your loser boyfriend and then he attacked you he hissed he was most displeased with us for fleeing but it was worth the damage he did to you lilylet this shocking information pass over her like a tidal wave so she and james had escaped voldemort before lily was broken from her reverie by a high pitched cruel yell from upstairs mingled with a loud thudding stop them the voice commanded from beside her marlene gave a convulsive movement a loud stomping interrupted the momentary pause of surprise and alice and frank came tearing down the stairs blasting spells at the death eaters as they came both of their faces were pale and taught but a determined light gleamed in their eyes lily felt a prickle of hope stir inside her in the the distraction the steely eyed death eater hastened to stun alice and did not notice lily wand slip out from his pocket silently it fell on the carpet inches away from her left hand not wasting a moment she focused every particle of her mind on a spell that would release her she murmered the words softly and to her intense relief the ropes slackened quickly she struggled out of her now loose imprisonment and scooped up her wand properly diffindo she said pointing her wand at the others binds in the commotion none of the death eaters realized that their hostages were escaping stupefy elphis bellowed as they all squeezed past the ruckus and to the back door lily didntturn around to see if his spell had hit she made a dive for the door knob when a flash of orange light hit her and sent her skidding into the wall lily someone shrill voice shrieked and alice stepped into her line of view c mon and seizing her arms she helped lily up and they re attempted to reach their only means of escape alohomora marlene yelled from ahead of them and the back door swung open lily and alice hastened through dodging various hexes they joined the others in the crisp night air followed by frank who narrowly avoided a green jet of light as he stepped outside c colloportus lily gasped the back door sealed itself with an odd squelching sound just as the loud thumps of bodies colliding hit it is everyone out frank asked in a voice of determined calm everyone nodded mutely except for marlene oh no she wailed mrs yerwut never mind that now elphis doge wheezed lets just get away before they find us here right lily agreed alice are you okay what happened not much you know who taunted us for a while then used the cruciatus curse on frank and i only when he had turned away we blasted the roof with the reducto curse and ran he got trapped under the rubble giving us time to escape alice explained as they ran minds set on getting off the property that horrible lily said quietly panting as she struggled to keep up oh no james and sirius dontknow what frank asked alarmed we have to go back for them frank you can t you re hurt alice crooned alice you and lily go back for them marlene and i will help frank off the property and apparate for help elphias offered alice and lily exchanged fearful but confident looks and nodded good luck marlene whispered as they turned back lily and alice hurried back to the cottage adrenaline pulsing through theirs veins oh james lily thought please be okay the girls arrived back at the cottage within seconds lowering themselves to the grass they crouched beneath a window to listen luckily no death eaters came their way we ve searched the grounds they ve moved away from the back and we cantmove fast enough to keep up we think they re heading through the woods out back until they get off the property a familiar drawl was informing someone very well a icy cruel voice replied lily shuddered for she knew who must be the owner of that voice set greyback loose lilystiffened when she heard alice horrified gasp from bedside her not wanting to know the answer lily asked what greyback alice turned her fearful brown eyes on her you mean who greyback her voice trembled with sheer fright he the most violent werewolf in britain and look she added with a moan it the full moon lily let this disturbing news settle for a moment her thoughts returned to remus he was still out there as a werewolf too lily come on we have to move if they re setting a werewolf loose alice said feverishly from beside her nodding lily scrambled after her friend not bothering to correct her that there was already a loose werewolf on the run oh how are we going to find them lily moaned as they made they ran away from the building still in a half crouch so the death eaters would not notice their return alice shrugged lets go wait in those trees and we can keep an eye out for them i just dontwant to be around when they set greyback out as lily and alice reached the trees they swept the immense yard with their eyes looking for any sign of the others look lily said excitedly pointing at the ground she had just noticed large wolf like pawprints alice eyes widened in horror those are werewolf tracks she whimpered i thought they were going to let greyback loose i didntknow they already did alice shh calm down lily hissed for she had just seen light pouring from a newly opened front door i have something to tell you alice gazed at her mistrustfully you canttell anyone oaky but remus is a werewofl too alice gaped at her at a loss for words lily t t that is not funny she said in a hushed voice i not kidding you alice you have to trust me okay now we d better follow these tracks sirius and james were with remus when i left them lily replied impatiently you left them alone with a werewolf lily they ll be killed alice responded refusing to budge lily stopped thoughtfully james had somehow transformed into a deer and animals werentaffected by werewolves but how exactly had james transformed the idea that he might be an illegal animagus still troubled lily and she didntwant to discuss it with alice just now never mind that now lily began but a loud howl broke through her unfinished statement both alice and lily gaze fell back on the cottage where a large silvery wolf had just immerged oh no alice breathed lily gulped what if it smelt them lily thoughts were confirmed when the werewolf swung it long ugly snout in their direction with another eerie howl it began running pell mell towards them for a moment the two of them were too shocked to do anything then instinct snapped in run lily screamed seizing alice arm and charging further into the brush we ve got to get away for the second time in one night lily was forced to run for her life chased by a blood thirsty and merciless beast lily look out alice screeched looking up lily narrowly avoided colliding with a second silvery figure in utter astonishment she watched as remus still as a werewollf leapt over her and attacked the second wolf there was a brief moment when the girls watched in awe as the two beasts bit and clawed each other the only sound that filled the night air now was the frantic yelping and snarls of the two creatures and the girls ragged breathing for a dazed moment they both watched as the wolves teared at each others flesh with their cursed fangs a soft tugging on the sleeve of her robes brought lily back to her senses lily james voice said comfortingly let get away from here turning around lily embraced james she had never been happier to see him in her life james kissed her forehead and then helped her away from the still battling wolves alice followed mutely wontthey attack us she whispered her eyes not leaving remus and greyback no james replied helping them up a hill werewolves usually get along but they ll fight to the death over prey but remus lily asked with alarm james gave her a grim smile his nose was bleeding gently and a large gash ran the length of his arm i dontplan to leave him he informed them and turning back to face the werewolves he held out his wand and performed the conjuctivitis curse greyback got hit full blow in the eyes sorry moony james muttered and did the same thing to him now lets apparate quickly we re off property now where sirius alice asked he gone to find the others dontworry he ll be okay i only hope remus will when morning comes james replied his face still set alice nodded and apparated with a pop lily gave james a quick kiss see you at headquarters then and she too apparated away 00000 lily awoke groggily the following morning rolling over sleepily she fell promptly off the couch ouch she cried rubbing her head where am i awoken by her startled yell the others stretched and yawned headquarters remember james said thickly from behind a yawn he was still lying on the couch lily had just rolled off of last nights events came back to her in a flash the mission the trap and finally the battling werewolves looking around lily spotted everyone else getting up from sleeping bags on the floor last night lily and alice had apparated back to headquarters to find sirius waiting safely with the others or all except remus they had all decided to stay at headquarters so that they could inform dumbledore of what had happened white faced he had announced them to stay and get some sleep he had also gotten a hold of mad eye moody and sent him off with emmeline vance and dorcas meadowes to wait until morning so that they could help remus the entire order now knew about his ailment lily got back to her feet and sat back on the couch james stared up at her with concern you okay lils yeah do you think remus is lily replied quietly silently she watched the other morning proceedings i sure he is he a tough guy sirius answered lily for james was yawning widely again oh and you realize you just fell on top of me he added conversationally sorry lily said sheepishly suddenly marlene excited voice flooded from the meeting room look she said as she immerged brandishing the daily prophet lily took it from her and gazed at the headline she read the article aloud for everyone to hear death eaters strike again it is said that you know who feared death eaters killed again last night the victims this time were mrs and mr yerwut who were found dead in their home at half past two this morning the couple who were aged 40 and 43 were muggle borns that had been living in a small house just outside of hogsmeade the scene of the crime suggests that the yerwuts put up a good struggle the upstair roof had caved in and much furniture had been broken or misplaced evidence also shows that the death eaters had let loose the much loathed and feared fenrir greyback in hopes of hogsmeade villagers being attacked fortunately the werewolf was found badly injured this morning it is believed that some other creature may have attacked it before it had time to contaminate the villagers unfortunately ministry officials were unable to capture the beast as it fled before morning arrived and no one was able to get close to it for fear of being bitten anyone with additional information about the yerwut murders or the whereabouts of greyback are asked to contact auror headquarters immediatly lily finished reading to a stretch of silence looks like moony subdued greyback james said grinning slightly sirius looked pleased as well i only hope that they ll be able to find him alice said from where she and frank were sitting on the other couch as if on cue a burst of emerald green flames from the fireplace caught their attention out stumbled remus supported by emmeline and moody remus james cried leaping off the couch and hurrying over to him sounds like you did a number on greyback remus smiled weakly and sat in an old arm chair are you okay lily asked seriously yes just a little tired he replied rubbing his eyes thanks mad eye emmeline dorcas he nodded at each of them who insisted it was nothing well you all should get home mad eye growled see you bye they called after him as he exited through the door there was a rush to follow his example and soon remus lily peter sirius and james were the only ones left did you take your potion moony sirius asked quietly i did but something must have gone wrong remus replied looking perturbed peter dropped the cup of tea he was drinking sorry reparo he muttered yeah well maybe you need to drink more or something next time james said thoughtfully yeah maybe remus echoed well i going to go home and rest i ll come with you sirius offered and the two of the exited the front door bye lily said kissing james goodbye he smiled at her i glad you re alright take care now okay i glad you re okay too and i will bye now lily responded and strode over to the fireplace she didntfeel like apparating she took a reasonable amount of floo powder and stepped into the grate tossing it down she shouted her address and as green flames overcame her she blew james a quick kiss a n there we go now you all know what happens lol sorry if it a bit jumpy please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 16 memories lily someone shrieked as lily arrived back at home in the fireplace grinning meekly she stepped out into cadence ecstatic hug are you okay callidora asked peering at lily over cadence shoulder we were so worried cadence exclaimed before lily could answer she stepped back and surveyed lily shrewdly where ve you been and have you heard there was another murder last night oh and they set fenrir greyback loose near hogsmeade do you think someone got hurt i know the daily prophet says something else stopped him but i dontknow if i believe it do you know who greyback is let her breath cady callidora said exasperatedly ignoring cadence affronted look she turned to lily and gazed questioningly at her lily knew the time had come to tell her friends the truth sighing she beckoned for them to join her at the kitchen table alright where should i start lily asked how about what dumbledore really wanted the day after alice and frank wedding cadence suggested lily felt a wave of surprise wash over her how did you know i wasnttelling the truth she gasped callidora rolled her eyes as she and cadence exchanged a look come on lily why would dumbledore ask you to a meeting if all he wanted to do is ask you if you re coping okay calli explained and for some reason there a big blank spot in my memory about that day you said that all he wanted but i cantremember a thing and cadence added we tried to contact james last night to see if he knew where you where we got worried when you didntcome home even though we found your note but anyways james wasnthome either so we tried sirius peter and remus and none of you guys were home that not coincidence what are you hiding from us lily evans cadence asked suddenly looking stern okay so lily began taking a big breath before she plunged into the story and she told them everything all about the order of the phoenix and who was in it about how calli had turned down the option of joining and all about the meetings including last night disaterous mission by the time she had finished and the time was considerably later both calli and cadence were gaping i turned it down callidora asked wonderingly i didntget invited cadence asked indigantly you fought the death eaters callidora added wide eyed and to think you could have been killed cadence put in dramatically girls lily started remus could have been killed callidora exclaimed her face was pale and her expression worried lily and cadence turned simutaneously to look at callidora she shrugged barely blushing wow lily wow cadence said in a hushed voice breaking up the momentary silence but both of you have to promise to keep quiet about this dumbledore or the other members will have my head if you tell lily said firmly both girls nodded mutely and lily knew from the expressions on their faces that the secret was safe i just glad you re okay lily and alice and the marauders too we were really worried about you last night calli said i know i so glad to see you two as well i was so scared last night i never even got to say goodbye lily said and she felt the burning of tears prickle at the corner of her eyes all three girls leaned in automatically and shared in a long comforting embrace 00000 november flew by in a flurry of snow and december arrived with a merry warmth although the weather remained as frosty as ever lily yawning widely awoke on christmas morning to the merry crackling of the fireplace beaming she looked around james sirius and remus had all spent the night and in honour of the occasion everyone had camped out in the living room at james house james turned abruptly in his sleep and wrapped his arm around lily who allowed herself to withdraw into the warmth from his body as she snuggled as close to him as possible a n and for any of sick minded people they re in seperate sleeping bags she saw that sirius and cadence were already up just then cadence caught her eye and smirked ignoring her for she had seen her and sirius quite busy kissing under their covers earlier lily flipped over onto her other side unfortunately her movement had awoken james morning lils he greeted her groggily and gave her a good morning kiss smiling dreamily lily thought i could wake up every morning to this morning love lily responded sweetly and gave him a kiss back grinning james sat up and rumpled his hair in the usual fashion oi happy christmas everyone now up and at em there a whole stack of presents under the tree with my name on them sirius shouted everyone seemed to stir under their sleeping bags then suddenly they had appeared from the depths of their sleeping bags and were sitting up tousled haired and puffy eyed they could only watch enthusiatically as sirius began tossing presents towards them from under the tree thanks calli said thickly from behind a yawn as she caught a particularly lumpy package yeah thanks remus echoed as a gift came whizzing his way he was looking quite dishevelled but the swiftness in which he opened his gifts proved otherwise watch it lily said angrily as one of her presents winged its way to her and knocked james over everyone burst out laughing and lily couldnthelp but crack a small smile trying to look furious she leaned over and straightened james glasses he kissed her as his thanks hey mate maybe it better if we just use magic remus suggested still grinning sirius shrugged and shrank back looking crest fallen accio lily presents james muttered pulling out his wand with a soft swishing noise lily numerous gifts flew towards them and landed with a soft thud on the floor thank you james lily said and tore the paper off the first one thanks cadence she murmered setting aside a gorgeous set of green dress robes then turning back to her stack she saw a package that caught her eye to lily from petunia read the small label on the top eyeing it warily she gently tore at the paper a small note and pin fell into her lap dear lily we have gone beyond the point of what some call sisterhood you are abnormal and i want nothing more to do with you so please do not get the wrong idea from this note i only wished to let you know that the lovely vernon dursley and i are getting married in january i also wanted to send you back this pin i found when i was moving my stuff from mom and dad old house and into my fiances good bye lily took the pin curiously and held it up to eye level for a moment she gazed at it blankly but soon the memories came flooding back daddy daddy look a four year old lily evans shrieked as she came flying out the back door to where her father was working on the new shed look what we got daddy look petunia evans added as she tore after her younger sister what is it girls asked a lean kindly looking man from behind a tall piece of hard wood sticking out their palms the two girls revealed two matching shiny pins each glittered a dazzling gold and bore the words sister forever mom got them for us when we went shopping lily said excitedly her vivid red hair blowing in the breeze it means we ll always be sisters petunia said seriously though her eyes sparkled with glee we ll never be apart ever that sweet girls but what will you do when school starts this fall petunia mr evans asked genially smiling at his two tiny daughters clad in their spring dresses petunia frowned and lily replied lookign agahst i going with her we re going to do everything together for the rest of our lives mr evans looked into the two smiling faces of the girls and frowned slightly i sure you will he finally replied lily asked james are you alright what that lily snapped back to the present and found everyone staring at her oh yeah she said quickly i fine sorry just an old pin from petunia memories you know they all seemed to be satisfied with the answer and went back to opening their gifts brushing aside her surprise lily joined them by the time every bit of papr had been torn and scattered around the room lily now had a pile or assorted items laying at her feet tons of candy though no chocolate frogs a few books new robes and a beautiful necklace from james consisted the heaping pile as lily helped the others magic their garbage into bags and changed back into her day robes lily reflected on the pin petunia had returned to her lily of course still had hers locked somewhere in one of her jewellery cases she hadntlooked at it in ages but for some reason she hadntfelt sad to recieve the pin only a mild sense of loneliness and loss petunia and lily had been ever so close in their early childhood days they had cherished their pins for a few years cleaning them regularly and bearing them proudly on their chests that had all changed when lily recieved her hogwarts letter until then the girls had always done everything together only a few out of the ordianry things had ever happened in lily presence and it was nothing big she had developed her fiery temper after her big falling out with petunia which incidentally had occured the very same night her letter arrived obviously lily had been over joyed when she found out that she was a witch and for a few blissful seconds petunia had been ever so pleased as well only that had changed when petunia found out she couldntcome she had refused to talk to lily for days afterwards and with each passing day became more verbally violent the first time both girls swore was during that summer angry at her sister and eager to test her new found talents lily got aboard the hogwarts express on september the first she had never seen petunia look so upset when she left that was the last time her sister ever showed any heart felt emotion to her since during the passing summers nothing changed petunia was as hostile as ever and during her summer vacation lily felt constantly on edge even at their parents funeral during the summer of lily sixth year didntbring any change to the girls demeanour and although lily would gladly have accepted an apology she never recieved one lily calli guys cadence hollared breaking lily reverie alice frank and peter are here coming lily shouted back and with a last flick of her wand the sleeping bags rolled themselves up and disappeared merry chirstmas alice said brightly when lily hurried to the door how were your gifts good thanks for the book lily responded as she quickly hugged her friend did you apparate yes frank said deeply the floo network always in a jam over holidays so we decided to come the quick way although flooing would be warmer well come in james said suddenly appearing at lily side sirius has just got dinner started sirius is cooking alice asked her eyes widening are you sure he can cook yes of course responded remus who had also joined the fray he had to learn when he lived with his family oh i just thought because of the whole quidditch party incident the chattering group sat happily in the sitting room on the squashy sofas and spent the next half hour discussing a story involving a post match party a few fresh baked pasties and a gaggle of polk a dotted first years afterwards they all enjoyed a large christmas feast which included all the usual favorites turkey various puddings and large flagons of butter beer and fire whiskey thankfully nobody had a single inch of abnormal patterns across their faces or arms they all then spent the rest of the evening happily reminiscing old times at hogwarts and wondering about what the students at hogwarts were doing now and although they touched very lightly on the subject of voldemort towards the end of the night lily felt it had been a rather enjoyable day love you she murmured kissing james goodbye before she apparated back home love you too james responded and they broke apart take care now smiling lily turned slightly and disappeared in a whirl of snow a n there we go chapter sixteen i know

general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 17 new year magic oh tonight is going to be so much fun cadence gushed happily as she ran her wand through her hair turning her many waves into bouncy curls i know i cantwait thanks so much for inviting us you two callidora agreed smiling as she admired her reflection in a mirror no problem alice answered from where she was doing lily makeup all four girls were currently at the longbottom residence preparing for a new years eve ball the ministry of magic auror group was hosting it and lily and alice had invited the others thanks alice are we all ready to go lily replied when alice had finished calli and alice nodded but typically cadence was still fastening her jewellery in place we cantgo yet she wailed rather childishly calli rolled her eyes come on the guys are probably already waiting downstairs i know it just i not good with these stupid clasp thingys cadence all three girls chimed hello you re a witch use your wand and hurry up lily snapped 00000 where are the girls sirius asked impatiently he stood by the door in his navy dress robes looking irritated probably getting ready james replied calmly he had chosen to wear deep red colored robes you know them yeah i suppose sirius responded glancing at his watch for the billionth time that evening peter was not coming as his mother was ill remus was sitting serenly on the sofa he was dressed in a smokey blue colored dress robe and looked the calmest of the all frank who was currently in the kitchen and dressed in brown robes had been pacing all night he wasntexactly keen on the idea of leaving the saftey of his home death eater attacks had doubled since christmas ten murders in only a short week sirius was antsy and impatient as usual but james was another case he had more pressing matters on his mind then death eaters or getting to the food in a hurry ah here they are frank boomed as he re entered the sitting room james head shot up and his eyes fell on lily she seemed to float down in her silky green dress robes which contrasted perfectly with her dazzling eyes her hair had been tied up in an elegant knot and she wore the beautiful necklace and bracelet james had once given her your look beautiful he crooned in her ear as he took her hand instead of replying she thanked him with a kiss and a brilliant smile alice came down the stairs next she had chosen magenta dress robes and her hair was like lily s tied back gracefully callidora followed her friends and greeted remus warmly in her lush purple attire her hair was straight though decorated neatly with a small butterfly ornament over her right ear finally cadence descended her reddish brown hair bouncing up and down in pretty spirals her robes were a light orange and could only look good on her sirius took her arm as she reached the last step thank you she said promptly and beamed at him sirius grinned and leaned towards her to tell her something she giggled and blushed most un cadence like well are we ready james asked breathlessly he tore his eyes away reluctantly from lily to address the others i think so alice replied and led them out the front door she tapped the lock behind them and her and frank apparated simutaneously to the ministry calli and remus followed suit and soon the only trace that someone had been in the yard was their footprints once at the ministry frank took the lead he marched them to the elevator and to a brand new floor which was only available on christmas oh it beautiful lily exclaimed appreciatively once they had stepped off the elevator silvery robs containing glittering candles floated across the crowds of dancing and chatting people silver butterflies flew amongest these bubbles alongside swarms of petite fairies dozens of spindly silvery blue tables sat scattered against the sides and little 1979s zoomed across the room as well occasionally settling in someone drink or hair yeah well shall we go and get drinks remus asked calli as he gazed around sure callidora replied and grinning back at her friends allowed herself to be led off into the hustle i think it going well between them sirius said unexpectedly as they two made their way to one of the spindly tables set up against the walls yeah calli seems to be quite happy alice replied remus too james added he seems alot happier then he been since serena died do you think there was something going on between the two of them cadence asked sitting bolt upright sirius and james broke into laughter oh no no no sirius gasped as his fit subsided they were cousins didntserena ever tell you no lily said feeling shocked how come he never said anything at the funeral i dunno he had alot on his mind besides i dontthink their families got along james explained oh alice said softly well never mind this frank said watching their conversation with great amusement are you girls thirsty oh yes alice replied for them we ll go get them sirius volunteered readily james nodded his agreement and all three guys swept off across the dance floor and to the refreshment table cadence watched them go with a dazed expression on her face lily who was used to this expression sighed what up cady oh what nothing i was just thinking alice and lily shared a look well that much was obvious space cadet alice remarked cadence turned to them suddenly as though she had only just realized they were there so lily pressed curiously i was just thinking cadence repeated slowly i think sirius has really matured since we left hogwarts lily thought for a moment yeah i suppose but what about it no nothing it just he never been with a girl this long before well a year and a few months is quite a while cadence alice told her patiently i guess i was just thinking you know about how we ve all changed i mean lily been with james for a year now alice you re married and now calli going out with remus i just mean wouldntit be funny if we all ended up with one of the marauders lily couldnthelp herself she burst out laughing sometimes cadence brought up the stupidest things frank isnta marauder alice said sounding offended i know but he should be he fits the qualifications better then that peter anyways cadence retorted grinning at lily laughter alice smiled in spite of her self and the girls were still clutching there sides when their dates returned remus and calli were with them ah so you ve returned cadence commented mischieviously as the guys passed out drinks i thought you d left us for good no we just needed a break from you callidora joked back we just wanted to get dancing right aways yeah what are we waiting for james said lily noticed he shot an oddly furtive glance at his friends as he offered his hand to lily they were all gazing at her rather unusually would you care to dance fair lady ignoring sirius gleeful stare and remus lit up one lily beamed and took james hand i d love to james led lily away from the others and onto the dance floor just as the orchestra struck up a slow song james snaked an arm around her waist still clutching her right hand in his left lily gladly place her free hand onto his shoulders and let him swirl away with her the song soon ended but lily and james remained and continued to dance though this time at a slightly faster rate sirius and cadence soon joined them followed by the others in no time three hours passed and it was then that they realized midnight arrived in five minutes time do you wanna go and wait outside james asked as he panted for breath having danced almost non stop both he and lily were breathless and pink cheeked sure they both headed towards a porch which had obviously been magicked so that it was portal like when lily stepped out into the crisp air she felt sure they couldntactually be underground anymore i thought the ministry of magic was supposed to be completely underground lily asked confused i think all of it is except this part this porch and the other ones across the room are all designed so that they re really above ground james replied matter of factly he released her warm hand and devulged it into his pockets lily frowned at this peculiar behaviour and leaned against the railing she began to shiver in the chilly air and light snow yet still james did not comfort her which he would have usually done lily looked at his face and pondered his serious expression for a moment she began to shiver even harder as wild thoughts began racing through her mind he breaking up with me no why would james break up with me it would make more sense for me to break up with him but i dontwant to do that i love him and i thought he was supposed to love me too or maybe he wants to start off this year new oh no it midnight james said softly breaking her panicked thoughts oh right lily replied her teeth chattering violently nervously she turned her head and avoided james gaze fearing what he might say but james didntsay anything he stood firmly in the two inch snow and stared determinedly out to the vast snow covered forest below and before them lily sighed wondering if she might suggest they go inside but she felt too anxious to leave and thus contented herself with a self warming spell feeling warmth run back into her toes made lily feel slightly braver turning her head slightly she tilted her head to the side so she could peek at james again when she did she felt her jaw drop open 00000 james led lily out onto the snow covered porch which led off from the warm ballroom inside it was cold outside but the conditions were perfect for what he needed to do i thought the ministry of magic was supposed to be completely underground came lily soft and bewildered voice from beside him startled from his nervousness he hastened to answer her question while keeping his voice quite steady once she looked a little less confused her let go of her had and plunged it into his pocket bracing himself for what he d told himself he d do all night silence fell momentaily between the two and james imagined he could hear the cloak ticking down the seconds to midnight finally a cheer echoed from inside the hall it midnight james informed lily quietly she turned to face him awkwardly oh right james was now so preoccupied he didntnotice the way her teeth clacked as she stood bent agaisnt the snow or the way her skin shivered for warmth james fiddled with something in his pocket as he geared himself up tell lily the thing that had been the purpose of this date as he played around for time he noticed lily staring stubbornly in the other direction and felt a pang he needed to do it now taking a deep breath he extracted his wand and gave it a wave all the while focusing in his mind on a certain spell just as he was going to reach for lily now still arm she turned to look at him he froze momentarily then seized her hands 00000 james lily asked uncertainly enjoying the warmth of his hands on hers surrounding them now was a group of ice sprinkled red roses they were the most beautiful she had ever seen james smiled nervously back at her and while keeping hold of her hands with one of his he reached back into his pocket lily felt an odd swooping sensation in her stomach when he revealed a small velvety black box james lily said yet again and felt tears come to her eyes lily james began i have loved you ever since i laid eyes on you for years i strived to gain your affection and now that i have i have never been happier i know it been a short while but i ve loved you so much longer that lily gulped and felt a tear slide down her cheek will you begin this year with me as my fiance lily evans will you marry me yes lily cried and let him slide a glittering diamond ring onto her shaking hand once in place she threw her arms around him and pressed her lips to his i love you so much she told him as he swung her around i love you too more then you can imagine mrs potter james murmured in reply they broke apart grinning lily potter lily echoed if possible smiling wider then she ever had before i like it james kissed her again a n i know it been such a long time since i last reviewed and i know this was a really short chapter but please bear with me i only stopped it here because it just didntseem to fit right to add more at this point yeah and sorry about the wait i ve been lazy school work taking up so much of my time by the time i finished i not in the mood to write anyways hope you all enjoyed i personally did but then again i wrote it before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 18 godric hollow all in all cadence informed her friends as they got ready for bed i think tonight was the best night we ve had in a long time lily smiled from behind her wash cloth she was still savouring the memory of james proposal yeah calli agreed in a dreamy voice i had a really good time i never knew remus was such a good dancer shortly after midnight struck james and lily had gone in and they all left for the night it was dangerous these days to be out too late what with all the death eaters and dementors stalking about james sirius and remus had all escorted them home and then apparated to their own homes lily are you okay cadence asked suddenly lily mind spun away from the image of the rose bushes and back into the bathroom she realized too late that she d been wuite for too long what she asked i asked if you were okay cadence repeated gazing at her friend with concern oh yeah actually i really good lily replied i ve got to tell you something though cadence and callidora both followed lily curiously to her room and plopped down on her bed lily sat in her desk chair and faced them smiling brightly so what this all about lily calli asked surveying lily expression with intrest lily found she couldntanswer just yet so she continued to grin lily cadence said seriously if you donttell us what up we re going to have to hex you into answering like that d work cady you didntexactly pass charms with flying colors lily responded happily though fiddling with her wand just in case cadence was well known to carry out her threats no matter how wild they might be true but i did well in that area calli said brightly oh i suppose lily sighed watching both girls faces light up with the prospect of finally getting the news they d been waiting for ready to duel then calli face fell lily evans she began crossly but lily cut her off still grinning broadly lily potter she corrected her friend yeah whatever calli said waving her hand wait what did you just say lily potter cadence asked her eyes widening to the size of galleons lily nodded for a moment the room was dead silent but then as if a bomb had gone off calli shrieked and leapt up to hug lily lily toppled over from the weight and crashed to the floor still laughing at cadence shocked expression lily calli squealed from on top of her this is so exciting oh my god lily cadence added now joining the heap on the floor why didntyou tell us earlier i dunno lily gasped and rolled to the side pushing her friends off of her so she might be able to breathe i guess i just wanted to wait for this moment merlin cadence said awestruck lily and james i know calli said excitedly and to think you spent three quarters of your life absolutely hating him lily grinned sheepishly well maybe i didntabsolutely hate him well then strongly disliked cadence said her eyes glittering with happiness but calli alice serena and i we always knew you two would hook up sooner or later well for someone who knew we d end up together you sure seemed surprised when i told you lily replied mischieviously i was just acting that way for your benefit cadence joked oh you two let it rest callidora said lily hasnttold us the details yet 00000 how d it go prongs sirius asked eagerly as he james and remus arrived at james house good james replied calmly but when his friends raised their eyebrows he had to relent alright it went great sirius punched the air in triumph and remus beamed finally remus said you two always were perfect for each other i know james said i cantbelieve it though i engaged i engaged to lily evans that d be lily potter now mate sirius reminded his friend right james replied so how did you do it remus asked as they all settled themselves into armchairs around the fireplace james shrugged i asked her put the ring on her finger you know what i mean remus said firmly though his face radiated with happiness for his friend okay okay james gave in throwing his hands in the air so i asked her if she wanted to go outside for a bit and she said yes so we went out onto one of those bewitched terraces then we waited for midnight and we were both all silent for a bit and when she wasntlooking i conjured up a bunch of rosebushes and then well you know i proposed sounds romantic sirius remarked nodding his head approvingly well congragulations james remus said sincerely when do you plan on having the wedding oh i dunno james said suddenly looking alarmed i guess we ll have to plan it soon yeah sirius agreed and you have to find a place to live you canthave her move in with you in this wasteland this wasteland james addressed sirius used to be your home too besides it wasntalways this empty and cold so you re going to ask her ot move in with you here then remus asked no james replied with another glare at sirius i ve found a pretty nice cottage up in godric hollow that sounds good remus told him sounds good sirius echoed then added does lily know this yet er no james said blushing slightly i thought i d surprise her remus couldnthelp himself he rolled his eyes what james asked defensively well honestly prongs what if she doesntlike it shouldntyou get her opinion on the matter remus told him impatiently sirius turned to james looking thoughtful he got a point mate james consdiered this for a moment no she ll like it i know my lily and besides we can just look for another place if worst comes to worst remus and sirius nodded in unison well we d better get going sirius said through a wide yawn yeah see you later james remus said agreeably bye guys be careful james replied he watched as the front door banged shut behind them yawning james pointed his wand at the door and listened to the clicking which told him it had been locked then savouring tonight success he rolled over and fell asleep right there 00000 bye alice frank lily called over her shoulder as she strode away from the longbottom house then pulling her cloak a little tighter against the wind blown snow she apparated to james house she d been busy all day this morning she had to get up early to go to auror training now that the holidays were over and then she d stopped by to see alice and tell her the news she d been ecstatic and immediatly began recommending certain caterers and flourists to buy the flowers from but now came the important part she d promised to meet james for dinner and they d discuss the wedding plans lily knocked hard on his door three times and waited a soft beat of footprints filled her ears and suddenly the door swung open lily james exclaimed brightly and pulled her inside hey she responded and kissed him quickly how was your day james asked genially as he pulled a royal blue travellign cloak over his head good everyone so happy about our engagement alice has practically already booked the band and everything lily laughed james smiled at her well her wedding was lovely so i wouldntworry too much yeah well almost ready lily replied with a grin james had never been too skilled in the organization department almost just where did i stick my wand he answered turning out his pockets lily rolled her eyes and marched over to a small table in the hallway looking for this she asked brandishing the long stick thanks lils james said gratefully and kissed her on top of the head lets go then lily walked back out into the snowstorm closely followed by james and they both apparated where are we lily asked curiously sweeping the stone cobbled street with her eyes it seemed to be a small town lily and james had appeared in a narrow alley so muggles would not catch a glimpse of their sudden prescence this my dear lily is the fine town of godric hollow james informed her and took her arm oh she responded comprehending i remember reading about this place back at hogwarts it well known for its hidden wizarding shops and places throughout the area james smiled at her enthusiam yes he said leading her out into the street there a very nice restaurant just down this way lily kissed his cheek as he led her her past many muggle stores and cafes they were both so happy that they were oblivious to the staring of many passerbyers their attention caught due to james and lily wizarding attire here we are james announced grandly the unicorn tail lily blinked and squinted into the snow they were standing in front of a grandly decorated but otherwise empty building upon closer inspection lily piercing green eyes could just make out a tiny sign on the door closed due to construction james watched patiently as lily released his arm and went up to the window inside was a dirty tile floor and a few puddles of water er how do we activate the magical version lily asked eagerly facing james with a dazzling smile this way love he told her and again taking her arm led her off to the side of the building another alley had been placed strategically there and half way along it was the back entrance to the building james marched up to it confidently and tapped the door with his wand lily heard a clicking sound and knew it had been unlocked james pushed the door open and led her inside lily gasped once she saw the interior she would never get used to how all magical places looked so magnificent once you differentiated it from the regular muggle places the unicorns tail was a lavish restaurant set in highly polished oak purple and blue velvet carpeted the floor and covered the many windows floating lamps containing a few fairies were set above every table and every single portrait seemed to feature a beautiful unicorn ah asked a tall curly haired waitress a table reserved for two that us james replied merrily the witch pulled out her wand and summoned two menus follow me please she told them briskly and led them off to a corner table i ll be with you in a moment wow james lily exclaimed appreciatively it gorgeous how do you come to know it james waited before replying he busied himself with helping lily out of her cloak well i ve done a bit of research into this area and i came by this place i just thought you might like it james finally said shrugging but his eyes sparkled with a secret this was something lily noticed and she surveyed him curiously research she thought for what but she didntvoice her thoughts for just then the waitress came bustling back and took their drink orders when she had returned with a gilly water and a goblet of mulled mead lily and james began making plans for the wedding it wasntlong before they had ordered their food and eaten it when they found themselves practically decided on the entire thing sirius will be best man of course lily confirmed with james taking a bite of her pudding of course james agreed and then the maid of honor will be i dontknow lily sighed i dontwant to pick just one but well alice has already had all the glory at a wedding why not give cadence the chance who knows maybe she ll end up marrying sirius james suggested lily smiled alright that sounds like a good idea so do you have any preferences to when you want to get married james asked well lily said turning slightly pink i thought maybe we should get married right away maybe in may james grinned i d like that and so it continued on like this for a few more hours ready to go lils james asked offering her cloak yeah where to now lily smiled letting him help her redress well i have a bit of a surprise for you james said innocently lily smirked i knew you were hiding something oh yeah james replied placing a few galleons on the table well lets go before it gets much darker they both re entered the chilly street lily instinctively moved closer to james who wrapped and arm around her then they both set off back up the street appreciating each others warmth lily moved with james wondering what the surprise was she didnthave to wait long for soon they turned off and down a country road a little ways away from godric hollow soon a fair sized cottage came into view it was hard to tell in the dark but it looked as though it had a spacious yard with a broomshed on it side it was heavily lined with trees on all sides so that most of it was blocked from view james led lily through an opening in the trees and down the pathway to the house this is it james murmured in her ear lily looked from the house to james in confusion wha but then it dawned on her you didn t she shrieked james silenced her with a kiss and lily kissed back passionately how sweet it was for james to go and find a place for them to live she loved it already do you want to go inside james asked as they both stood in the yard gasping for air lily nodded excitedly and followed him to the door alohomora he muttered and tapped the lock the door swung open and revealed it contents lily stepped in before james and looked around her new home to her right lay the sitting living room furniture already in place a magnificent fireplace stood against the wall looking gloomy without the prescene of sparkling flames and then to her left was a hallway which led behind the staricase directly in front of her lily noticed that beside the living room was another hallway leading around behind it do those lead to the kitchen lily asked james he nodded come on i ll show you lily followed her fiance down the left hallway and found herself in the midst of a gigantic kitchen oh it wonderful she breathed taking in sight set against the left wall was a large oaken kitchen table opposite to it was the prepartation area complete with a wood topped island the floor was hard wood and on the back wall was the back door which led out into a big backyard do you want to see upstairs james asked lily nodded eagerly and they marched side by side back to the staircase and then up it a large landing lay at their feet once they had reached the top lily pushed open the door in front of her and was met with awe at the sight of the master bedroom gorgeous purple drapes hung over a large window and a large king sized bed was the center of the room cherry wood dressers sat up against the walls and a door way leading to the bathroom was present on the right wall lily smiled at james this is perfect i thought you might like it he replied modestly they both back out of the marvellous room and lily quickly examined a neatly set up guests room and another small bedroom each on opposite sides of the main room another bathroom could also be found beside the guest room lily hugged james an immense sense of relief washing over her now she wouldnthave to worry about the housing issue should we wait till the wedding to move in james asked after they had kissed again lily smiled thoughtfully maybe or we could tomorrow james asked lily bit her lip and nodded both of them laughed happily author note so here we go chapter 18 and i know it rather long and boring but what can i say i just needed another one of those good explaining filler chapters just so we re all up to date oh and i was rereading chapter 17 and i realized that it wasntall that short in fact it was one of my longer ones so yeah not that it really important oh and i have to thank you guys i was overwhelemed by the response i got off of last chapter seven reviews that a new record thanks so much well hope you all enjoyed i promise the next chapter will be a bit more exciting before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 19 senseless thoughts well i think that the last of it remus exclaimed as he stood back from a large sofa lily had told her friends first thing when she got home that night after james showed her their new house and they had been thrilled the next day they had offered well took it upon themselves to help james and lily move in that very night so here they were yes lily said appreciatively coming to stand beside her friend thanks for the help everyone no problem cadence said as she levitated the last few dishes into the cupboards yeah it wasnttoo bad i exhausted though sirius sighed as he collapsed into an armchair lily couldnthelp but roll her eyes you know muggles have to move all their stuff by hand she informed the slouching man by hand you mean they have to lift this all callidora exclaimed wide eyed yes they do remus told her he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek wow what going on james asked as he joined them from the kitchen he walked up to lily and wrapped his arm around her waist she beamed at him as alice took the liberaty of answering for the tired group sirius was just complaining about the hard work and so we told him about muggle moving oh james laughed typical sirius chucked a pillow at him which james blocked with a simple shield charm well we d best be off frank yawned intervening yeah cadence agreed it going to be lonely without you lily aw i sure you ll manage lily said feeling flattered she abandoned james to hug her friend besides i sure you ll be here all the time we were always at alice when she got her own place true alice remarked as cadence laughed alright bye lily calli said enjoy i will love you girls remus and frank shook hands with james and sirius embraced him briefly see you mate bye sirius james replied finally only peter was left well er congragulations he squeaked lily smiled at him warmly the boy had looked ever so peaky since the illness of his mother thanks wormtail be safe okay james said peter nodded and strode out the door james aimed his wand at it carefully and it locked well he asked turning to lily it lovely she breathed the house was now full of their possesions and an assortment of new furniture i cantbelieve we ve got our own place now lily added after a moment of thoughtful silence i know it seems only yesterday i was playing pranks on everyone that i meant and you were hollaring at me mind you i quite enjoyed it james told her mischieviously lily playfully smacked him on the arm as they walked into the kitchen together oh i sure i mean you could really tell how much you loved my lectures by the way you moped for days afterwards after i rejected you lily told him a look of surprising thoughtfulness shadowed james face for a moment he waited until they were both seated at their kitchen table before he spoke again why did you reject me all those times anyways he asked sure she had given him her countless reasons back then but now that he was on speaking not yelling terms with her he felt curious lily felt taken aback by the question she recovered quickly because you were a stupid arrogant prat she informed him then i mean james looked hurt was i oh i sorry james lily said suddenly feeling guilty he looked like a wounded puppy i didntmean it that way although you were well rather immature james regained his composure with a startling grin i know he chimed lily laughed well anyways i tired we should probably turn in for the night eh lily felt a wave of nervousness completely stun her she just realized she would be sleeping with james for the first time in the same bed these thoughts swirled around her mind she felt completely and utterly dazed lily james asked with concern he leaned forward and touched her arm lily jumped what she yelped james frowned slightly are you okay oh yeah er fine she lied she didntwant james to think she didntlove him because she did with all her heart she just felt apprehensive she was still a virgin what if james wanted to take their relationship farther now that they were living together she wasntready for that yet she was only eighteen well if your sure james replied not looking thoroughly convinced he turned to leave the room you coming lily glanced up at him then replied in a small voice yeah just a second i ll just put these boxes away james continued to gaze worriedly at her as she extracted her wand and gave it a swish the last few piles of boxes disappeared without a sound then taking a deep breath she smiled bravely at her fiance and followed him upstairs 00000 lily stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror she had taken as long as possible to get changed into her nightdress and was now finishing brushing her teeth and washing her face james was already in bed having not delayed the whole pre bed ritual lily complexion was pale and her vibrant green eyes wide and bright showing no hint of tiredness lily you re being stupid james wontexpect anything to happen i mean you re not even married yet besides he loves you he knows you re not comfterable with a more intimate relationship yet this is just stupid anyways why should you be so worried you love him you ve been going out with him for a year and you re going to marry him merlin sake just get to bed already it nothing that big lily kept telling herself this stuff repeatedly it made her feel slightly more relaxed nervously she tiptoed out of the washroom flicking the light off behind her she approached the bed cautiously and layed her wand on the end table on her side of the bed james had taken the left which was good considering lily always slept on the right side hey love james greeted her affectionately hey james lily replied softly sliding into bed and staring up at the ceiling james turned out the lights with his wand night he breathed and wrapped his arm around her lily tensed briefly but nothing else happened she glanced over briefly and saw that he had already fallen asleep an enormous sense of relief fell over her and she relaxed stupid she thought snuggling close to his warm body author note yes this chapter is really short but i had to get this in it huge although it may not seem like that imagine the story if i hadnttold you all how lily settled in anyways this chapter was extremely hard to write their relationship is deepening and we have to keep that in mind i only fourteen and so i have to start writing a little bit more delicately the rating is probably only going to go up a very slight bit although harry has to come along some where i not going to go into details or anything wow this chapter was extremely awkward i hope it doesntseem like that to you all i really worked hard with this chapter i was actually very nervous posting this chapter because it starts touching on bigger stuff and i not sure if i did a good job with it anyways hope you enjoyed please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 2 premonition finally serena groaned as the train pulled to a stop i starving you re always starving serena cadence replied in mock exasperation honestly i just dontsee how you can eat so much and remain as skinny as a wand serena grinned come on you three we d better fetch our luggage callidora cut in then added as lily got to her feet lily are you coming you girls go get a carriage i have to go and make sure the prefects are doing their jobs i have my doubts that potter gave them the proper instructions callidora gave her an encouraging smile if he didn t dontbe too hard on him he really likes you lily rolled her eyes define harsh becasue i ve been looking up a few new hexes this summer she replied lightly as she left the compartment expecting the worst she trudged past the students who were scrambling to get their possesions in order and made her way towards one of the many doors poking her head out she glanced towards the other outside along the train in order to check that the prefects were supervising the un boarding james potter she yelled upon spotting the prefects who were refusing to let people out what in the world did you tell the prefects evans dear do i hear you calling asked james as he practically flounced towards her she gave him a death glare what did you tell the prefects she asked dangerously james looked puzzled for a moment then slapped his head right he thought to himself as he remembered what he had said great start for the deflating process well i said they shouldntlet people off in case er in case in case what lily snapped angrily in case voldemort is around james came up with lily glared at him in surprise voldemort that nutter that been doing all the killings i heard about him in the daily prophet this summer but james nodded eagerly please buy it he thought anxiously please oh well good thinking then i suppose she replied feeling stunned james smiled right then i suppose i had better tell them that if they think it safe they can start letting people off lily nodded suspiciously as he walked off she hardly believed he would be so thoughtful but then again she musntget her hopes up it was likely to be another stupid trick 000 so prongs remus asked seriously once they were all in a carriage leading to the castle did evans bite your head off about the prefect thing grinning james replied i told her i wanted to be sure voldemort the other marauders jumped at his name and peter yelped wasntaround i told her that i had warned the prefect to check for him first and did she buy it sirius asked with an amused grin ignoring remus frown james nodded and exchanged a high five with sirius james you want to tread carefully around her with what you say about well voldemort she not likely to know much about him is she he only started to get really powerful this summer remus warned his friend james gave him a skeptical look what are you saying he asked i just saying this is no light issue you shouldntuse it as an excuse for your mischief remus explained with exasperated patience you worry too much moony sirius scoffed but james frowned thoughtfully i suppose you might have a point he admitted thinking of all the murders that had taken place in years previous and most prominently that summer sirius gaped at him while peter remained impassive remus however nodded seriously just watch what you say james he said solemnly james nodded as a slight sense of forbidding engulfed the previously cheery atmosphere bigger things were happening outside the walls of hogwarts 000 so this voldemort getting more powerful is he lily asked out of the blue as she sat amongst her friend in one of the school carriages callidora uttered a small scream and candence gave a violent shudder serena winced at the use of his name baffling lily what d i say lily asked confused callidora recovering herself whispered dontsay his name why not lily asked in bewilderment you didnthave a problem with it for the last few years that because he gaining power lily he not just some rogue maniac anymore he become ruthless the ministry cantcatch him they say he got to be the darkest wizard we ve seen in a century cadence explained grimacing as she spoke it not just some minor issue anymore he seems awful from what i ve read in the prophet lily admitted sadly all those murders he is callidora agreed quietly but why haventthe ministry been able to catch him yet they have loads of aurors on their side and vold you know who is only one wizard lily said as if trying to rationalize the situation he not just one wizard serena explained he got tons of followers the death eaters we ve heard of so often not to mention the armies of giants and dementors he employed word is he even enchanted corpses to build a mass of inferius lily eyes widened with horror at the disturbing thought of dead people doing evil bidding she shuddered as she attempted to shake this thought from her mind so he after anyone who not pure blood lily inquired in a hushed voice as she recalled the prophet going on about all the pure blood obsession yes he seems to think that the only people worth living are pure bloods he is killing muggle borns and half bloods not to mention any aurors pure blood or not who decide to stand up to him it just terrible callidora murmured is he really that big of a threat lily asked feeling a tingle of fear run up her spine as she reflected nervously on her own blood heritage cadence nodded he just too powerful they say dumbledore is probably his only worthy opponent and we all know that dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard she explained gravely everyone is at risk it war callidora added darkly oh lily said softly i see come on you guys forget about this i sure the ministry will catch him sooner or later besides what is the chances that he ll ever get one of us serena said forcing an optimistic note into her still hushed voice as the carriages pulled to a stop in front of the castle doors it was a feeble attempt to stay positive and though the others agreed simply to pacify their minds a dark chill had settled upon their group lily had a feeling that this voldemort reign hadnteven really begun yet a n so this should set the mood of the story a bit better i wanted to get in a bit about voldemort and all just as a reminder that he is gaining power anyways this chapter was pathetically short i know but the other chapters i hpe will be better comments critism and what not are all welcome in reviews before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 20 in his arms lily awoke groggily to the beeping of her alarm clock she froze momentarily when she felt james arms around her stomach then remembered that they were now living together she smiled as his eyelids fluttered and he began to stir morning she cooed kissing his forehead and reaching over to shut off her alarm clock she made to slip out of bed but james arms closed tighter around her dontgo yet he murmured thickly i have to james i ve got auror lessons at eight thirty lily protested lightly james frowned but didntrelenquish his grip james get off lily panted struggling to slide out from under his arms still james didntlet go and in fact lily noticed he had fallen back asleep who can keep such a tight hold when they re sleeping lily asked aloud to no one in particular feeling a prickle of annoyance lily attempted to wake james up get up you lazy git up she grunted trying to push him off of her instead of the desired effect james toppled off the edge of the bed bringing her with him james yelped and jumped to his feet lily still trapped in his embrace he stared at her in surprise for a moment and then released her thank you she quipped sorry james replied sheepishly lily couldnthelp but laughing his guilty smile was adorable and lily wanted to lean over and snog him to death but being the prim and organized girl she was she tore her gaze away from his face and turned to the closet she was already behind schedule if she wanted to be at the ministry in time it quite alright lily told him flashing him a quick smile james laughed and got back into bed do you have to get up so early he mock complained lily rolled her eyes some of us have jobs you know i know i ll get a job sometime too it just i have enough money right now probably enough to last a lifetime and still have money left over mum and dad were quite wealthy you know james countered oh i suppose lily gave in and quickly scrambled into her work robes she snatched up a small bookbag then turned around to face her fiance i ll see you later okay sure james replied do you mind if i head over to remus for awhile though it a full moon tonight and the others and i want to make sure he gets his potion alright yeah that d be fine i ll see you later tonight then lily said smiling james nodded and jumped out of bed to kiss her goodbye love you he whispered in her ear be careful i will and i love you too she waved at him and hurried down the stairs grabbed a muffin and exited the front door taking a bite out of her breakfast she glanced back at the house their house she sighed happily and her breath rose as fog in front of her it was nice to share a place with james 00000 class dismissed a strict looking witch at the head of the classroom announced it was three o clock auror lessons were finally over for the day lily gathered her supplies and stuffed them back into her bag it had been an exceptionally long day with three tests in the various areas lily felt sure she had goofed up a bit on her stealth examination she hadnthad much time to study what with james proposal and moving lily alice voice asked lily glanced up to see that her friend was waiting for her yeah lily replied trying to sound cheerful despite her weariness would you like to come over to my house and have some tea with me i d like to hear how james and yourself are settling in alice said brightly lily grinned sounds good to me james isntgoing to be home for awhile so we might as well great let go then and alice led her from the classroom they chatted happily about the quizzes they had done that way as they made their way to the main lobby and apparated to alice s so alice asked expectantly as the two girls entered the kitchen lily shrugged and removed her coat we re doing fine mind you i had quite the time getting to work this morning lily smiled at the memory alice looked interested why she questioned curiously lily couldntsupress her giggle he wouldntlet me get out of bed i finally ended up pushing him out of it and landed on top of him you should have seen his face afterwards alice laughed he probably still remembers how you bat bogeyed him in fourth year when he bound you to him with a charm lily face lit up with amusement i didntremember that no wonder he was so tentative yeah alice agreed anyways how was last night after we all left lily thought there was a rather knowing look in her eyes she knew alice was trustworthy and so she confessed to her friend about the fears and jitters she had experianced the night before when she finished alice was grinning broadly i remember i felt exactly the same way when i first moved in with frank so dontworry it perfectly natural yeah i feel a lot better now lily told her agreeably wow look at the time alice said glancing at her watch i hadntrealized how long we d been talking lily too examined the time well thanks for the talk alice but i d better go james will be home soon and i dontknow what we re doing for supper yet no problem you re welcome anytime anyways frank should be home any second now he had to stay at the ministry late he doing a special project for his second year of training alice told her and they walked to the door lily slowly put her coat back on and conjured up a pair of gloves it was still freezing outside and it looked as though a blizzard was starting up lily turned to head out the door but someone apparated suddenly in the yard squinting through the snow lily recognized frank tall figure lumbering towards them frank alice called anxiously are you alright frank stepped into the warm house panting and bent over as he tried to catch his breath on his face was an expression of pure panic frank alice persisted alarm starting to spread through her facial features what the matter headquarters under attack he gasped must go imme diat ly lily felt the blood drain from her face alice and her exchanged a quick look of fear and shock alright let go lily said hoarsely alice gave a firm nod and helped frank stand straight then all three of them left the brightly lit house and stepped out into the frigid evening air lily closed her eyes hoping that there werentmany death eaters and apparated 00000 so the hospital told you that you ll be absolutely fine if you drink it sirius asked doubtfully for the last few full moons remus had gone to saint mungos to make sure another event like the last didntoccur again this was his first transformation at home for awhile that what they said remus said tiredly the entire group of marauders were at his place and sitting in the armchairs in front of the fireplace and what did they say again about why it didntwork last time james asked remus shrugged and frowning replied they said i must not have taken it properly that it wasntmade right or something he rubbed his eyes wearily but i distinctly remember taking that potion it not easy to forget i mean it tastes so bad peter do you remember moony taking it sirius asked you were visiting him at the time werentyou peter started as he was addressed but managed to answer quite calmly yeah he took it i mean i the one that gave it to him so he definitely did james frowned and furrowed his eyebrows thoughtfully there didntseem to be a reasonable explanation anywhere for the incident that had happened a few months ago the marauders troubled silence was interrupted by a sudden loud banging on the front door sirius swore loudly and jumped to his feet peter toppled off his chair but remus got up and made his way to the door staggering slightly it okay moony james said giving his friend a gentle push back to his seat i ll answer it remus nodded gratefully and returned to his chair james dusted off his robes and peered through the small window beside the door who is it he called me came the muffled voice of a female it dorcas meadowes sure dorcas james hollared back struggling to make himself heard over the howlign wind from outside what s your boggart shape a coyote now let me in you great prat replied the voice james swung the door open and a harried looking dorcas stumbled in she seized james robes in terror you have to come quickly she told him headquarters is under attack james gave a small gasp of surprise but neverless pryed dorcas off him of course we ll come guys james asked peter sirius and remus were already on their feet and grabbing their jackets er moony james asked tentatively remus glanced towards him i dontthink you should come you know since you re sick and all remus glared at him for a moment but james glared right back finally remus gave a reluctant sigh and settled back down with a sigh of relief james summoned his coat hurry hurry dorcas scolded tersely james and the other followed her quickly out the door and apparated to headquarters when they arrived on the cool street nobody paused to think but ran straight for headquarters they were joined in their dash by mad eye moody who apparated nearby nobody spoke but they contiuned to inhale and exhale sharply as their destination grew closer james hoped that lily hadntbeen alerted he always got so worried when she was involved in one of the fights but james had little time to think of his fiance everyone fear and courage heightened when they reached the large door muffled noises were coming from inside with a last look between them sirius and james reached forwards and pushed the door open restiporela hissed a death eater that the now opened door revealed james narrowly dodged the jet of purple light and tackled the man he spared a quick glance backwards and saw that moody had been knocked to the ground wincing he turned back to the battle at hand 00000 the street where the headquarters of the order of the phoenix was located appeared to be deserted lily couldntimagine how the death eaters had found out where they were after all the secret keeper at the time was marlene mckinnon and she would never tell as if he could read her mind frank suddenly told them breathlessly the mckinnons were found dead marlene alongside them they must have forced the information out of her before killing her lily felt tears come to her eyes and she clapped her hads to her mouth alice looked equally shocked we ll we d better hurry she said sadly the others nodded and they set off at a run down the street definite signs of a fight were evident around the doorway for one loud bangs and shouts were echoing from inside the old building and the most horrible tell a tale sign was a pool of crimson blood trickling down the cool steps the victim lay at the top of the stairs blood oozing from one of his eye sockets mad eye lily cried dashing forwards to his sprawled out body bravely she placed a finger on his neck and waited there a pulse she finally said with relief good frank exclaimed now why dontyou girls stay here with him while i we cantjust send you frank alice interrupted the order needs as many wizards and witches as it can get yeah lily agreed quickly before frank could object precious seconds were ticking by as they spoke alice do you want to wait alice thought for a moment and looked at her husband who shrugged i suppose just be careful you two she said hesitantly great lily said let go frank lily sped up the stone steps with frank on her heels lily uttered a spell under her breath and the door swung open she felt a wave of familiar adreneline swoop over her as she surveyed the scene of battle james was locked in battle with two death eaters nearby sirius was viciously dodging rapid spells sent his way by a large hooded man and the others were scattered all over the place some bleeding some knocked out cold some brandishing their wands so fast that it was a blur lily took a deep breath and dodging many spells made her way to james side stupefy she said firmly aiming her wand at one of the death eaters attacking her fiance the death eater noticed her a moment too late and the spell hit him or her firmly in the chest thanks lils james cried dodging another spell lily made to aim another spell at the remaining death eater but he turned tail and fled she watched with surprise as all the death eaters scurried towards the door what in the name of merlin james breathed incredulously lily looked around i guess they realized they d finally been outnumbered she suggested james didntanswer but grabbed her in a bone breaking hug you okay he asked planting a kiss on her head mmhmm mad eye not though alice is with him outside oh no she outside lily replied with alarm and ran swiftly back to the door she glanced outside fearful of what she might find but was met with a great sense of relief alice was sitting on her butt a cut across her cheek but otherwise unscathed the death eaters came out this way alice informed them grinning slightly we know james and lily said in unison are you okay frank asked as he joined them at the doorway and stooped so as to help alice to her feet of course alice responded triumphantly i got one with a wicked bat bogey hex before he apparated lily laughed despite the mood dumbledore suddenly apparated in front of them all and they all fell silent is everyone okay he asked his blue eyes flickering with alarm yes replied frank mad eye might need to take a visit to saint mungo though nobody else got hurt lily asked breaking the relieved silence i know it a miracle dorcas sighed she too had joined the crowd around the door well i ll help alastor get to the hospital dumbledore said thank you all for coming i afraid we must have a spy in out midst though he looked at each of them imperiously but now is not the time for interrogation all of you hurry home now and get some rest lily feeling dazzled bid goodbye to the others and apparated home with james she fely exhausted and confused by the night events everything had been so sudden and jumpy do you really think their a spy amongst us lily asked james quietly he responded slowly there must be i cantimagine how else the death eaters would know that marlene was the secret keeper it so sad lily said she was a good friend back at hogwarts james hugged her i know lils but we ll pull through this the order will catch the git who passed the information and we ll stop voldemort lily let her body relax in james strong arms the same one that had restrained her so playfully this morning now she could think nothing of his mishief and all of the renewed danger but as she and james embraced lily just knew that with james she was safe in his arms nothing could harm her author note hooray chapter twenty and i over 90 reviews first of all thanks to everyone who reviewed you all rose to the occasion magnificently and i cantthank you enough anyways this chapter was kindof jumpy but i wanted it to be that way it shows how switftly the battle came and went well i hope you enjoyed this chapter mostly

the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 21 icy emotions lily hurriedly collected her things and apparated from the ministry it was the day after the order had fought so vigilantly against the death eaters and lily was exhausted getting about four hours sleep worrying constantly about who the spy could be thinking about marlene death and then awakening early for auror training wasntexactly the most revitalising energy one should achieve for a full day of work james i home lily called loudly from the front door an echoing silence seemed to rush through the house lily felt a tingle of fear run up her spine james she called again this time a little more uncertainly oh no she groaned quietly praying that he had just gone out that everything was fine withdrawing her wand she put down her bag and slowly moved towards the kitchen she entered cautiously her wand directly in front of her wavering slightly please let everything be okay please let him be fine i dontknow what i d do if the death eaters took him from me lily frantic thoughts were interrupted by a loud banging lily jumped her head nearing the ceiling it felt as though she had suddenly plunged into a pool of ice water the fear overwhelmed her and her breathing became quick and sharp desperately she struggled to remember what she had learnt in auror classes so far keep silent and steady have your wand ready at all times dontpanic lily let her mind focus on the last tip as she worked her way back to the front of the house and to the stairs fearful thoughts flooded her mind but she tried to keep from panicking ever so slowly lily crept stealthily up the stairs 1 step 2 step 3 step she finally reached the landing with a relieved sigh but her fear returned almost immediatley the master bedroom door was closed so that if someone was waiting inside they would have the advantage a thought that worried lily but she had to check the room she had to make sure james was really out of the house and not being held captive by some violent death eater lily closed her eyes briefly trying to summon every ounce of bravery she possessed she opened her startling green eyes and took a deep breath then stepped forwards and tapped the door knob with her wand it unlocked with a seemingly loud click lily pushed and it opened boo shouted a loud voice lily rocketed upwards in a leap of terror there was james potter laughing with such hilarity he seemed to notice little else for a moment lily stood there in stunned shock and then instict took over smack lily hand collided hard against james face sending him to the ground ow what was james began but lily sent a violent hex his way the stinging hex left a large welt across his arm bright pink and painful lily james said in outrage i was but again he was cut off short this time lily had sent a bat bogey hex his way and it happened to be a very good one lily watched in fury as the black leathery winged things attacked her fiance face for the first time since hogwarts lily was absolutely enraged with james her breathing was deep and ragged as she waited for the curse to wear off when it finally did all james could do was stare at her in shock his face marked with deep gashes and bites she stared back feeling her angry welling up until she finally burst into tears james opened his mouth to say something but lily hd already wheeled around and was storming down the stairs without looking back she tore out into the yard and apparated leaving the door wide open to the chilly drafts 00000 check mate callidora announced grinning across the chess board cadence scowled back at her that not fair she complained those stupid pieces were telling me where to move them that wizard chess calli said triumphantly if you dontlike it dontplay maybe i won t cadence retorted that what you always say it is not cadence began in defense but both girls were interrupted by a loud banging on the front door calli blinked at cadence is sirius coming over or something i dontremember making plans i dunno cadence replied sounding equally surprised here i ll get it cadence hurried over to the door and peered through the eye hole she quickly opened it lily she exclaimed we werentexpecting you lily what the matter calli asked coming over to join her friends lily tried to choke out an answer but cadence shook her head and led her to the sofa closing the door behing them for a moment the three of them sat there the only noise being lily sobs i it james she finally managed to choke out covering her face with her hands what the matter cadence asked alarmed you re not breaking up are you lily just sobbed harder causing her two friends to exchange worried glances you are calli asked smally lily shook her head frantically and both girls breathed with relief then what wrong lily cadence pressed gently removing lily hands from her face lily peered up at them both from puffy red eyes i came home she began shakily callidora nodded encouragingly listening intently and the house was dead quiet i called for james but no one answered and so i thought something was wrong is james okay lily did the death eaters get him cadence interrupted looking quite scared lily eyes seemed to blaze with anger no he fine she said shortly ok calli said shooting cadence a warning glance what happened next i i went upstairs lily continued and our bedroom door was closed so i opened it really nervously and she wailed into her hands again i hate him the stupid immature idiot cadence looked confused by lily outburst but calli felt like she knew what must have happened then he played a prank on you didnthe she concluded lily nodded her face hard a look of comprehension dawned on cadence face that horrible she exclaimed suddenly a thumping on the door awoke them all to reality lily stood up abruptly if it him tell him i not here tell him you haventseen me today at all okay calli frowned but cadence nodded and jumped up again to get the door hurry go hide yourself somewhere in my room he ll never be able to find you there lily obliged hastening down the hallway and to cadence room she made to open the door but she only managed to get it half way open before it jammed she swore with frustration as she poked her head through and surveyed the scene cadence room was far messier then it had been before lily had moved out lily had at least been able to convine her friend to keep it managable then but now clothes seemed to cover every inch of the carpet owl feathers spare parchment and broken quills lay scattered across the floor and empty candy wrappes littered the area around the desk cadence bed was unmade and her wardrobe was wide open various cloaks robes and objects spilling out of it i ll be able to hide in here but will i be able to get out lily asked herself but there was no time to contemplate for james angry voice was now floating down the hallway lily squeezed inside the door and shut it quietly she just managed to crawl under some clothes in the wardrobe when voices sounded right outside the door i tell you she not here callidora said impatiently james seemed to be ignoring them and opened the door or as much as it would open holy crap cadence you actually sleep in here he asked incredulously yep she answered proudly james wrinkled his nose at some dirty laundry in a heap near his feet and backed out he probably thought she wouldntdare enter a place so messy but then again lily didntthink she would either the door closed with a snap and lily listened closely as the voices faded away well sorry for bothering you then it just there was kindof an accident and i really need to talk to her tell her if you see her wontyou james voice asked the girls must have nodded for lily didnthere an answer she waited a few minutes and then she heard the door slam shut but lily knew james she closed her eyes and waited a few more moments and heard the door open and shit again this time lily emerged dusting the cauldron cake crumbs off her robes as she arose he gone lils calli informed her opening the door and peeking her head in thanks lily replied relieved her face was still red and splotchy but she didntfeel as angry any more either cadence messy dwelling had a mysterious calming effect or hiding took up most of her concentration lily decided it was the latter so what are you going to do now cadence asked once they had all seated themselves back in the living room lily shrugged i guess i could probably forgive him as long as he apologizes soon but it ll take me a while to get over this he scared me so bad i though my heart would rip in two calli nodded wisely perfectly understandable only dontforget he cantapologize until he see you lily sighed i suppose but i dontreally feel like going back tonight we should have a girl night cadence exclaimed loudly lily and calli both winced before agreeing i think that a brilliant idea lily said smiling 00000 james stomped moodily down the stairs from cadence and callidora flat he had searched everywhere the longbottom s his fellow marauders and now the apartment he couldntunderstand where lily had gone and the thought made him feel guilty mad and utterly terrified he hadntmeant to scare her so bad he had just wanted to play a little joke that might have ended had things not gone so terribly wrong in a little snogging james felt miserable with himself now lily probably thought of him as she she did at hogwarts for so many years he couldntbear to have her hate him although he didntthink it was a little over dramatic to go and attack him like that he wasntsure his face would completely heal for the wedding if there still was one james sighed depressedly and plunked himself down on a nearby bench what if lily got so upset she went and did something stupid what if she in trouble god why do i have to be such a prat sometimes bitter and worried thoughts tugged at james brain giving him a pounding headache hours passed by and james didntleave his perch on the small metal bench the air slowly got colder as night approached and dark soon fell glumly james glanced up and looked back at the flat the small windows above the shop were lit up and glowing he thought longingly of the warmth and shivered was it just him or had it suddenly just gotten colder he glanced up and down the street nervously but it appeared to be deserted james felt to miserable to go home so he remained his face getting slowly and slowly number in the cold he was sure his hair must be coated in snow by now and he sub conciously reached up to ruffle it as he did so he felt a wave of terrible sadness well up inside of him he was watching as a fourth year lily chucked a book at him and broke his jaw a fifth year lily was shouting at him as he dangled snape in midair it was christmas break of sixth year and lily had just slapped him he was on the train ride home from hogwarts and lily had just poured the entire contents of her pumpkin juice on him lily was turning away from him tears pouring down her face as she tore out of their house and into the snow james shuddered as an icy feeling overwhelmed him slowly he slipped off the bench and into the snow drift he suddenly had the insane urge to curl up and die lie still in the snow he was so caught up in his own depressed thoughts he hardly registered the rattling sound nearby and a hooded shape lowering it face to him expecto patronum a familiar voice yelled james looked up weakly and dimly saw her figure illuminated by the shining silver light of a ghostly looking cat but no it couldntbe 00000 whatever happened ms evans an unsmiling curly haired witch asked lily who stood beside her friends and the marauders in a small ward at st mungo answered timidly we found him out in the snow he was being attacked by a dementor and so i sent it off with a patronus but he d already passed out she said tearfully he ll be alright wonthe yes yes the witch said preoccupied with a patient in the next bed just a small thing called hypothermia by muggles nothing we cantcure with a simple pepper up potion the more important thing is however that this dementor attack be reported to the ministry at once i ve already seen to it remus informed the healer lily tried to manage a grateful smile but it came out more like a grimace good the healer said now i ll leave you here until he wakes up you she gestured at lily can stay with him tonight the others have to leave before ten thirty we ll be keeping him over night for observation there nothing seriously wrong with him all though i still confused as to where he got all those scratches lily nodded numbly and took james hand in hers it was ice cold sirius conjured up some chairs and helped lily into one he then sat down with the others and they waited lily noticed that callidora and remus were sitting well apart she shot calli a curious glance and her friend mouthed back we broke up this afternoon lily gaped and mouthed back what for none of the others noticed their silent conversation so calli leaned over and whispered nothing we just dontseem to have the right chemistry that too bad lily whispered back but calli merely shrugged and leant back peter looked at them curiously but thankfully kept his mouth shut it was a few more hours before james finally awoke as his eyes fluttered open lily leant forwards and placed her lips upon his all earlier traces of anger had vanished lily came the muffled question she reluctantly broke away to look into his eyes a quick glance behing her showed her that the others had left to give them a bit of provacy yes she answered smiling he looked throughly confused an awkward silence followed i really sorry about earlier i had no clue it would affect you that way he mumbled quietly shh it okay just just dontdo it again you scared me so bad and i sorry for er attacking you lily replied sheepishly james grinned at her which she tentatively returned i love you he whispered lily laughed at the guilty expression on his face she knew he was still trying to make up for earlier i love you too she replied climbing up on the bed at his request she snuggled under the covers beside him and curled up he put an arm around her waist and kissed her lightly on the lips she smiled as she kissed back and then broke away with a last warm smile between the two of them lily waved her wand causing the candles to go out and both of them fell promptly asleep author note this chapter was actually spontaneous i hadntplanned anything like this for the plot but it sortof just came i actually wrote this chapter really easily it just all seemed to fit so right anyways i hope you all enjoy reading it as much as i did writing review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 22 may blossoming lily lay sprawled on her back across the living room carpet she sucked lightly on the end of her quill as she re read a long list of parchment her and the girls had all gotten together tonight to plan the wedding it would be taking place in just a month and they were nearly finished with all the recent commotion it was no surprise that lily had left it so long usually punctual she had been under quite a bit of stress in the following months after the dementor attack order meetings had become ever so frequent lately and auror training was dishing out piles of homework in fact it wasntuntil james had asked whether she needed help with the preparations that lily remembered that there wedding was approaching so you dontwant any house elves to help out cadence asked eyebrows raised as she leaned over from her postion on the sofa to check the list no lily replied absent mindedly besides your mom said she d take care of all the cooking well it your funeral cadence said simply leaning back and brushing a strand of golden brown hair from her face lily glanced up to see alice rolling her eyes honestly cadence you d think you ve relied on house elves your entire life it doesntkill people to do their own work once in awhile well technically it can cadence countered and rambled off into a long explanation of the time an old witch had gotten up to do her own cooking for once and ended up dead ignoring the argument in which callidora had now joined in lily turned back to her list marrying in small wizarding church in godric hollow reception will be in our backyard turquoise and green decorations fairy lanterns magical glitter star streamers ect bridesmaid dressing in turquoise james dressing in his black dress robes best man sirius in dark green dress robes shopping for bridal gown food shall be served by mrs summers chicken steak treacle tarts ect pick up wedding ring for james lily smiled as she went over her decisions she wanted it to be a small ceremony but a special one she and the girls planned to go shopping next week sometime for the supplies and gowns lily was quite looking forward to it as it had been constantly within the last months death eater attacks were still on the rise and personally lily needed a break from all the physical and emotional lows how it going ladies sirius black asked as he emerged from the kitchen followed by remus peter and james good calli replied i think we re almost done yes we are but i still need to go over them with me james lily added james smiled warmly at her and joined her on the floor of course can we hear them peter asked quietly lily felt surprised but she obliged and picked up the list again she read the short list to the group who listened intently that it sirius asked once she had finished yes lily replied defensively it all they really needed alice explained i mean if it here we donthave to book anything and frank already reserved them the church he good friends with the staff there sirius shrugged sounds good lily remus said smiling warmly what the date again may seventeenth james replied i cantwait cadence suddenly squealed she stood up and twirled into sirius arms weddings are so much fun we get to watch our best friends promise to be together for life party and dance the night away oh and we get to eat awesome food which isn t incidentally being supplied by houselves sirius smiled lightly as he caught her not to mention it the perfect oppurtunity for romance well duh cadence replied in a mocking tone it a wedding they all laughed so who are we going to invite james asked once their giggles had died down lily inserted the tip of her quill back inside her mouth and considered the matter well this lot obviously she finally said sirius gave a fake cheer of surprised pleasure and frank alice piped up lily and james nodded do you two have any family to invite peter asked curiously lily shook her head then stopped well there always petunia you want to invite her callidora asked incredulously after the years of misery she put you through well no lily admitted feeling slightly guilty i was just saying i do have some family left i suppose alice mused if you can count her as family anyways back to the subject james interrupted we ve got the longbottoms the marauders cadence and callidora you could invite a few people from the order remus suggested mildly then catching lily sharp look he added of course not too many wouldntwant it to look suspicious that might work lily alice said slowly you could invite dorcas mad eye elphias and a few others lily felt a pang inside her chest she knew alice was purposefully suggesting various names steering the conversation away from marlene although they hadntbeen good friends it wasntexactly comforting to know that someone you had known for seven good years was now dead dully lily reflected back to that chilly night when moody had lost his eye and marlene had been murdered lily james asked are you there wha oh yeah sorry just thinking lily said startled from her reverie alice smiled at her reassuringly anyways that allsounds good i think that basically it us girls can go shopping next thursday since alice and i get the day off from work you two can work that into your schedules right cadence and calli both nodded simutaneously well then it settled james exclaimed beaming at them all 000 this one too lacy lily announced flatly she stood scowling infront of the shop mirror eyeing with displeasure the fiftieth wedding dress she had tried on cadence rolled her eyes at the same moment that alice sighed callidora gave a loud groan lily at this rate you ll end up going naked that would make james pretty happy cadence joked mildly lily shot her a dirty look i sorry but i just cantfind the right one it not like i trying to be overly fussy but these are all too muggle ish lily complained waving her wand and switching her clothes with the spell well we re running out of sources alice said bluntly there probably only two wizarding robe shops left in britain and chances are they ll have the same sortof stock that it cadence replied her face lighting up lily want to go shopping in paris not really lily answered feeling very flustered cadence face fell it was just an idea she muttered yeah well that d be too much of a hassle nobody here can speak french calli pointed out but lily i think cadence is on to something why dontwe check out some foreign catelogues oh i suppose lily sighed reluctantly and allowed herself to be dragged out of the shop and to a nearby bookshop she soon arrived back at her house friends in tow holding stacks of wizarding magazines james was out with the boys so they had the place to themselves here cadence said forcing a pamphlet into her hand start looking lily obidiently began flipping through flirty robes for fancy occasions she had soon searched it entire contents and came up with nothing cadence and calli were both feverishly scouring a few of the magaznes and alice was ruffling through one her eyebrows furrowed anything good in there lily asked skeptically alice glanced up at her quickly seemed to sum up her appearance and then stared back down at the page beaming yep she said happily well let see lily said excitedly making a grab for the book she took it and surveyed the page alice had been on across it glossy pages was the twirling photograph of a beautiful wedding robe in long white layers the gown seemed to float down around the ankle area the sequined patterened bodice rose up into two thin straps the beads that covered the front in a gorgeous design were colored white and green a floating tiara above also had vivid green stones embedded into the elegant arches and matched perfectly with the outfit glancing downwards lily noticed that it also came with a pair of silver strappy sandals with green embroidary it perfect she breathed cadence and calli jumped up and strode hurriedly around the table to take a look james will melt when he sees you in that cadence exclaimed excitedly calli nodded in fervent agreement thanks alice lily cried throwing her arms around her friend alice looked rather pleased with herself 000 lily i home james warm voice floated upstairs lily jumped up from the bed where she had lain admiring the wedding robes the girls had helped her order earlier hey james lily said grinning as she hurried down to greet him he swung her up in the air briefly as he met her kiss so got everything we need moony helped me pick out your ring and we picked up our robes and food he told her yes i think we e ready lily replied unable to stop beaming nervous as she was she was greatly looking forward to the wedding ceremony only a few weeks left james kissed her again want to go and grab something to eat he asked sure where did you have in mind lily countered nothing fancy i thought we might like to head up to the leaky cauldron and grab an ice cream afterwards james suggested unless you ve had enough heading out today of course no no that fine lily said just let me nip upstairs and grab my cloak james waited patiently as lily head of beautiful red hair bobbed back up the staircase why didntyou just summon it james asked amusedly as she returned lily shrugged i dunno habit besides it doesntdwell to get too lazy you know what that

has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 23 forever and always lily woke up suddenly in the early hours of morning glancing at her alarm clock she saw that it was five in the morning she groaned and snuggled closer to james closing her eyes she waited to fall back asleep but an alarming pang resounded in her mind the wedding she gasped sitting up in bed immediatly her stomach churned with butterflies pale faced she turned to look at james his chest was moving up and down softly in rythem with his beathing he looked positively adorable with his messy black hair sprawled across the pillow lily sighed trying to calm herself it would not do her good to be exhausted for the ceremony yet try as she might she could not force herself back to sleep she toyed anxiously with the idea of performing a sleep charm but then decided it would be too risky it was a complex spell and their was the chance she might make it too strong and oversleep as she lay frustrated trying desperately to fall back asleep an hour soon passed and james awoke morning love why re you up so early he mumbled sleepily she blinked at him wondering how he could be so calm but then again he probably hadntremembered yet the wedding lily said timidly james eyes widened in remembrence she could almost hear the oh yeah going through his mind you nervous he asked letting the news sink into him she nodded slowly she didntwant james to think she was having second thoughts but she felt more terrified then she ever had in her life he smiled reassuringly as he ruffled his hair it ll be fine you still want to do this right lily thought she heard a subtle note of nervousness in this question and it was her turn to reassure him leaning over to kiss him she whispered of course james embraced her and pulled her back under the covers for a moment they both lay still and contented enjoying each others warmth and love we ll have to get up soon james lily said softly he grunted and tightened his grip not this again lily thought inwardly but she couldnthelp smiling today she was going to marry james feeling elated at his thought she managed to squirm out from under his arms he peeked at her reproachfully as she slid off the bed do we have to he asked pleadingly james felt goosebumps rise on his neck at the beautiful sound of her laughter yes you ve got to go over to sirius and get ready the girls will be over at seven to help me and you cantbe around because you cantsee me in the wedding dress until late this afternoon lily responded striding over to her closet and changing into a pair of jeans and a simple blouse oh alright james grunted as he too got up and changed then they walked hand in hand to the front door james kissed her warmly before he stepped out into the warm sunshine during that kiss lily felt her fears temporarily evaporate naturally she was disappointed when he broke away i love you lily told him watching him hurry slightly down the path love you too he called and disapparated with a soft pop for a moment lily lay relaxedly against the door frame as she thought about what lay in store for today her peaceful pondering however was brought to a frightening stop when alice apparated directly in front of her hello alice exclaimed cheerfully lily calming from her start managed to smile weakly at her friend hey oh you poor thing alice said exasperatedly you looked absolutely famished you re starting to sound like my mother lily joked closing the front door and leading alice to the kitchen for tea do i ah well i suppose someone got to make sure you dontdie of nerves dontthey alice said happily lily rolled her eyes did you feel this nervous before you married frank yep i think it part of the whole marriage package alice told her lily remained silent as the water in the kettle boiled she just couldntseem to come to terms with the fact that today she was getting married in only a few hours lily did you hear me alice interrupted lily snapped back to reality what i asked you when cadence and cali coming over alice repeated slowly umm any moment i think lily replied thoughtfully well knowing cadence they ll probably be late alice pointed out this caused lily to laugh as she made two teas once both girls had taken a sip alice spoke i take it james has already gone lily nodded frantically trying to keep from shaking good you can try on your dress and make sure it fits okay then alice waved her wand and a parcel appeared in mid air they had had the robes sent to alice so james would have no chance of stumbling across it lily gazed at the box in awe she had so longed to see it over the last few weeks she gently removed the lid and held it up try it on alice urged abiding lily hurried into the living room where she hastened out of her other clothes and into the gown she entered the kitchen again with a twirl what lily asked in mild fear as alice gaped is something wrong with it no alice replied simply it just looks so perfect alice voice trailed off as the doorbell rang lily spun around to be greeted with hugs by callidora and cadence lily you look amazing calli exclaimed stepping back to survey her friend attire cadence nodded her approval feverishly well hurry and change back lily cadence stated we ve got a lot of decorating to do for the rest of the morning the girls decorated the back yard they had bought the supplies a few days ago and were almost completely organized lily and callidora set up the tables and hung streamers on the trees and garden house where the band would be playing james had booked the flouncing fairies for the reception alice set up star shrubs strategically around the designated area while they emitted clouds of glittering silver stars she was also placed in charge of levitating the fairy lanterns into place over each table and enchanting the sky so that turqoise and green glitter would sprinkle lightly over the dance area cadence meanwhile was busy baking a last few items in the kitchen and when her mum showed up around noon the two of them laid out the dishes and arranged the platters on the tables finally after placing a preservation charm on it they were done lily stepped back to admire her work while wiping a strand of red hair out of her eyes everything was in place and looked beautiful the others seemed to agree for they were all nodding their heads or staring around with a smile well lily dear mrs summers gushed as she briefly hugged the bride to be congragulations thank you mrs summers lily responded quietly the hours they had spent working had taken her mind off her jitters but they were now back in full force c mon lily cadence said taking her arm you ve got to get dressed mum offered to head to the church and start welcoming the guests when lily hesitated alice jumped in domtworry frank got the church all decorated and he taken care of everything else i know lily replied her mind reeling are you sure everything done nothing else needs preparing for only you callidora said firmly pushing lily inside the kitchen we ve got to get into our robes now the ceremony begins in just a few hours go on dear mrs summers urged lily nodded feeling silly at her reluctancy she was such a perfectionist sometimes that she just had to make sure everything was ready this was part of what made her so organized but also so stressed once mrs summers had apparated to the church the girls headed upstairs to get dressed accio wedding robes lily said once they were in the master bedroom in a few quick seconds the gown had flown it way to lily hand almost numb from nerves lily quickly slipped into the silky material again her friends gaped at it beauty and lily felt relief that she at least looked nice the turqoise robes her friends and herself had chosen looked equally good cut in wavy ruffles at the end similiar to lily own gown they were gorgeous thr bodice was simple tied with a lacy ribbon around the waist and cut into a low but not overly revealing neckline next came hair and makeup cadence who was the maid of honour was an expert on wizarding makeup in fact had she not gone chasing after the idea of being and auror and then hippogriffs she would have made a great makeup witch so this in mind lily asked her to do hers cadence happily obliged using a pale green eye shimmer and silver eye liner she defined lily facial beauty then using a clear gloss she coated lily lips lily anxiously hurried to look in her bedroom mirror she was pleased with the result in her opinion she looked pretty good and when she asked the others for their opinion they heartily agreed thank you cady it looks brilliant lily exclaimed throwing her arms around cadence her friend smiled modestly it no problem alice callidora want me to do yours the other two both jumped at the oppurtunity and lily left them to it she walked over to her dresser and slipped her engagement ring off her finger it would soon be replaced by her wedding ring then lily rummaged through her sock drawer to where she had hidden james wedding ring she lightly fingered the soft black velvet box where it lay enclosed it was a simple silver band with thin gold lines engraved on the outer edges on the inside the words love forever and always had been carved in very thin letters she only hoped james would like it however her renewed worries were broken off by the sound of the doorbell she knew it would be the witch delivering the wedding cake and she looked expectantly at her friends callidora who had just had her makeup done scrambled to her feet and hurried to answer it being already dressed lily was now expected to wait and remain out of sight she passed the time that calli was gone by fastening the wedding jewellery she had been lent or bought this included a delicate silver chained necklace with an emerald set in a heart and a matching bracelet her earrings were also part of the set lastly lily used her wand to put her hair up into an elegant bun she left a thin amount of her long bangs on either side down to frame her face and then set her tiara on top that looks magnificent lily alice commented peering at lily through her one opened eye cadence was applying eyeshadow to her other eyelid thanks lily replied shakily as callidora re entered the room only a half hour to go 00000 james paced anxiously up and down the hallway of sirus house already in his sleek black wedding robes he was waiting for sirius remus and peter oh merlin i getting married today i am getting married married to lily evans this is the moment i ve always hoped for the moment i ve spent years at hogwarts working towards wow i going to be a husband and lily going to be my wife lily and james potter james smiled happily trying to force calm upon himself his moment of silence was cut short however when remus lupin entered the hallway leaving the bathroom and fully dressed in his formal attire sirius soon exited from his room and peter from the guest room as decided the marauders were all in green robes although sirius was slightly darker ready to go get hitched prongs sirius asked grinning broadly james punched him on the arm playfully you bet let go james led the posse out of the house and into sirius front yard taking a deep breath he and the others apparated to the church 00000 lily huddled in the corner of a small room with her friends all of them smiled encouragingly as they waited for the remaining guests to settle into their seats because both her parents were dead lily would be walking down the aisle alone sirius had volunteered to take her down but she had refused if her dad couldntbe there then she would do it by herself for the first time in awhile lily felt tears sting her eyes at the reminder of her parents deaths it had been brutal murders although nobody had had a clue as to who had done it lily remembered the day so many years ago when she had been told dumbledore had called her from her classes and sat down and talked to her about it devastated lily had cried for the entire meeting during which dumbledore explained his suspicions about death eater involvement lily frantically shook her head knowing that her parents wouldntwant her to be sad on her wedding day lily smiled though as the last images of her parents smiling faces faded from her mind thinking about them had prepared her for what was to come next here we go lily alice said softly she hugged her friend gently good luck lily nodded mutely it seemed that the nerves she had suffered from all day had just increased ten fold at alice announcement her other friends patted her on the back or whispered words of widom to her as they passed when their turn in the procession came lily listened to the soft beat of wings of her owl fly down the aisle because she and james knew no young children they had opted for their owl to be the ringbearer finally it was time for lily to go she closed her eyes briefly took a deep but shaky breath and exited the room slowly step by step she made her way down the aisle as each sandaled foot softly hit the long green rug her sense of anxiety increase staring blindly ahead as she walked she could only sense everyone eyes on her she only knew that callidora and alice were standing neatly at the altar cadence standing slightly ahead of them alongside sirius when she finally reached the halfway point she stared up into james eyes he was waiting at the front hands folded infront of him as she took the last few strides she drowned herself in his comforting hazel eyes the small wizard they had employed to do the ceremony began his speech for a long time he rambled on about god and life promises lily was only half listening and she knew it was likewise with james only when it came time to exchange their vows did they break eye contact james began first i james potter take you lily evans to be my wife my true love since the moment i laid eyes on you my faithful partner and friend i will truly cherish our union in love as i strive to give you everything i ve ever lived for i promise to cry for you in times when you are mourning to laugh with you when sunlight brings a smile to your face to love you when forever is complete i give you this ring as a solid reminder of the everlasting love i vow to you i will love you forever and always james took her hand and removing a ring from the cushion their owl held clamped in his beak slid it onto her finger she glanced at it through the tears sparkling in her eyes and saw that it was a twinkling silver band complete with a tear shaped diamond in a dazzling emerald lily then focused her mind on the vows she had written i lily evans take you james potter to be my husband where there was once a time i denied the love i held for you let this union be all of what it is will be and never was i give you my life of tears joy sorrow and love in this exchange let light shine on the promise to you that you will always be my one true love through life and death i give you this ring as the joy you have brought me and the joy i may bring to you i will love you forever and always lily brought the wedding ring she had for james off the velvet and slipped it onto james finger she saw him glance at it and then look up to meet her eyes she was startled to see that behind his glasses his eyes were eyes full of tears she smiled tentatively and he returned it then the minister added a few more words to the ceremony finally finishing with the words i pronounce this witch and wizard husband and wife tears spilt down her face as lily leaned forward to kiss james in the bond that would forever change their life 00000 the rest of the evening passed in a blur lily was so overjoyed so drained and so in love that the mix of complex emotions overwhelmed her senses by the end of the reception all she could recall was the beauty of it after having nibbled on a little dinner she and james had cut the cake then they had danced the night away amongst their few but happy guests lily didntthink she had been happier in her life she was now lily potter finally the reception ended and everyone left the marauders frank and lily friends being the last to go when sirius had finally apparated out of the yard and cadence and her mum had cleared away the last of the mess lily turned to her new husband i love you she murmured green eyes sparkling in the moonlight i love you too james replied leading her to bed very tired lily struggled out of her beautfiul gown and into her pyjamas she met james in bed him having been quicker to change and get ready thank you for marrying me mrs lily potter he said lovingly lily tried not to giggle and thank you for marrying me mr james potter she felt shivers run down her spine when he pulled her close under the covers lightly lily kissed him on the lips and he responded and what began mild began to grow into something more passionate lily spine tingled with anticipation as they grew even closer embracing each other evenmore tightly scared though she might have been a few months ago lily know felt no fear that night she met him in the promise of their union of love love that would reign forever and always a n the chapter we ve all been waiting for sorry about the extensive wait i know you re probably all sick of hearing excuses but this time i do have a really good one i went on vacation for thanksgiving so i didnthave internet access anyways i hope you all enjoyed this chapter i poured a lot of emotions into this one and i hope i ve done it justice i also hope i did the end part well as you might ve read in a previous chapter i ve been a little worried about tackling that part i tried not to make it revealing or anything but i hope you all get my drift i still feel very very awkward about writing it lol cursed immaturity anyways i would really appreciate reviews being as this was an extremely complex chapter i hope you enjoyed before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 24 summer end the weeks following the wedding passed in oblivious happiness when the newly wed couple werentspending time with their friends they were simply enjoying each other love and companionship everything seemed to almost lighten in these months the amount of order meetings lowered considerably as death eater attacks and such came to an almost standstill although the occasional murder occured voldemort seemed to be waiting for something but determined now to let this spoil the summer mood lily and james continued their new life as huband and wife at the end of july james signed up for auror training now that he was married he had finally decided what he wanted to do with his life he was going to help fight in the ongoing war against voldemort lily was pleased with his decision as it allowed them to spend a great deal more time together during lunch and breaks and with this new progress time seemed to pass even more quickly therefore it came as a surprise when lily found herself flipping the calender over to the september page lily are you almost ready we re going to be late for work james called from upstairs lily rolled her eyes james usually being the late one i am ready you great prat she called back to him in a taunting voice you re the one still getting dressed i dressed james said indignantly as he joined her in the kitchen lily snorted to see him trying to place his wizard hat on his foot sure she laughed james blushed slightly when he realized that it wasnthis shoe lily smirked as she strolled over and attempted to help her sleepy eyed husband place his garmets in the correct place he ran a hand through his already tousled bed head and kissed her for a moment lily kissed back until they both remembered they were supposed to be at work we d better go love james sighed as they broke away lily groaned inwardly knowing that he was right but much more preferring to stay at home with james their relationship had deepened immensely since their marriage so reluctantly yet still immersed in bliss the two stepped out of their door into the warm summer end air and apparated to the ministry 00000 lily alice called hurrying over to her friend lily was sitting at the ministry cafeteria with james munching on a peanut butter sandwich between kisses what lily replied pulling herself away from james at first alice didntanswer but rather looked around warily for any passer byers then lowering her voice conspiciously she whispered i just heard from mad eye that there an order meeting tonight urgent he says and that we d better get there as soon as we get off work lily felt a prickle of fear rise within her he didntsay why did he she whispered back alice shook her head taking a seat opposite to her no but i think it something very important james forehead creased in thought while lily bit her lip anxiously the thought that even mad eye one of the best aurors in the world was nervous made her feel extremely uneasy while the three of them were thinking of what horrors the night might hold for them frank arrived looking weary and woe begotten alice immediatly jumped up to greet her husband what the matter frank she asked her voice soft with worry he turned his eyes dully on the lot of them mad eye told you i expect he asked about the meeting yeah james said quickly is that all he told you lily and alice nodded silently alarm beginning to flood their senses all this had come on so unexpected i think we re going to fight tonight mad eye and i had the chance to speak at break and from what he says he heard from dumbledore you know who is planning a huge attack tonight or at least that what they suspect frank explained gravely lily blanched what in the name of merlin could inspire so much terror in two of the greatest wizards of the age james seemed to thinking along the same lines maybe we should take the afternoon off work he suggested he was evidently stuggling to keep his voice from trembling lily placed her hand over his while alice answered that definitely out of the question she said briskly the ministry would get very suspicious if all the order members mysteriously took the same day off you know frank nodded in agreement and lily had to admit they had a point nobody outside members could know about the order of the phoenix seeing as the ministry was set on fighting voldemort by themselves i suppose james muttered by the way where are we having the meeting tonight remus again ever since headquarters had been attacked last winter the meetings were being held at different members houses providing of course that extra security measures had been put up no you re mate sirius has lent his house to us for the night frank replied munching on some of the salad alice pushed at him the four of them ate the rest of their lunch in silence worry pressing on them like a heavy blanket finally lily got to her feet unable to stand the tenseness any longer i going to get back to class she announced checking her watch she figured she might as well leave now class begun in ten minutes anyhow alice nodded and followed suit i ll come with you she offered we can get some last minute studying in for our concealment exam the girls bade their husbands goodbye and headed to the office wondering what tonight had in store for them 00000 lily sat breathlessly in sirius living room alongside the others she was currently curled up on the sofa leaning against james as he curled his arms around her comfortingly dumbledore stood in the center of the room looking very worried as he spoke to them of the meeting contents i afraid i have some very bad news for you all he sighed sadly lily felt a wave of dread spill over her at this pronouncement jame arms tightened around her and they silently awaited dumbledore grim announcement dorcas meadowes was found dead this morning it is my belief that voldemort nearly everybody flinched peter giving a small yelp killed her personally her body was found about twenty minutes away from her house at the foot of the mountains dumbledore informed them what are you saying sirius asked his hands were clenched into fists and his dark eyes seemed to flash with alarm it seemed apparent to them all that whatever voldemort had been waiting for with enough business that he had decreased his attacks had finally arrived i think that this means dumbledore continued he has gotten a small army of giants to join his side lily gasped her face whitening as so many others it is also in my reasoning that an attack has been planned for tonight much evidence was found at the scene of ms meadowes murder so you want us to go and stop them remus asked confirming everyone worst fears dumbledore nodded hesitantly then added only if you wish to put yourselves in this danger i understand that this will be much riskier then our usual missions and certain individuals might wish to refrain from waging this sort of battle he looked pointedly at alice as he said this and she looked rather taken aback but before she could demand a deciphering of this look the other began piping their support i ll come sir sirius announced boldly as will i stugis podmore put in he had recently gone from recruiting order members to taking part in missions the others hastily began putting in their support lily and james included alice was the last one to agree obliging with a last questioning glance at dumbledore then it is settled dumbledore said gravely if you ll all follow me we are apparating to 101 willow street kent lily got up hand in hand with james and they followed their old headmaster and leader into the starry skyed evening james squeezed her hand before apparating and whispered a be careful in her ear feeling more frightened then she usually would lily closed her eyes and with a last thought of confidence to herself apparated after james and dumbledore the first thought when lily arrived with the others on willow street was that dumbledore had mistaken the address she had never seen a community so at peace lights gleamed from behind curtained windows and the street were peacefully deserted birds were even lamenting their last of the day songs into the fading sunset as lily looked around she could see the others were also frowning quite confused what up with this sirius asked coming up behind james lily jumped as his voice reached her ears startlingly loud in the silence james shrugged no clue but dumbledore never been wrong before maybe their just biding their time i agree added remus who had now joined them things arentalways as they seem lily turned away from the conversation and glanced at dumbledore he was examining something with a satisfied sortof nodding ignoring the others lily walked up to him what is it sir she asked bending down beside the kneeling wizard they ve been here dumbledore said calmly surveying her from behind his half moon spectacles how can you tell lily whispered take a look i believe they teach you this in auror training tell me what you see dumbledore said refusing to answer her question directly curiously lily moved into the spot dumbledore had made for her and she stared at the pavement after noting the signs there she quickly scanned the street for more evidence as she contemplated the scenery she felt all the other eyes boring into her neck she straightened up concluding her evidence well she began straightening up and facing dumbledore the sewers bent in the middle as thought something heavy trod on it also you ll notice that several cars have been dented on the side that facing the street and lastly lily said pointing to an old looking and deserted house down the street that fence has been forced open you can tell because all the guadings are bent dumbledore beamed at her observations very good he praised then addressed the others as mrs potter lily grinned rightly says there are tell a tale signs of giants coming down this road i imagine that the resident here have been under te imperious curse so that they will have not reported anything suspicious so what are we going to do frank asked dumbledore smiled grimly at him looks like we have to attack them where they re hiding shall we everyone followed obediently at his words walking in his walk down the peaceful street as lily thought about what dumbledore had said she realized that this calm was too good to be true james soon caught up with her and grabbed her hand good observing he commented thanks lily replied her voice quivering slightly in only a few seconds she would be fighting twenty feet tall monsters i think you should turn back james whispered abruptly as they neared the gate lily felt a prickle of surprise and indignition not this again she snapped james winced as thought she had slapped him but continued his persuasion please he begged nobody will look down upon you if you leave now i cantstand to lose you and i you lily said firmly besides i ll look down upon myself if i go and leave you and the others to face this danger and i the one with more auror experiance she added james stared down at the ground lily please this isntgoing to be like the other fights james stop it nothing bad will happen okay lily said lying to herself and james but you ve got to trust me i can take care of myself you ve got to let me do this lily tone was now more urgent as they arrived at the iron fence how could she make james understand that she wasntgoing to leave him to fight alone alright james gave in he looked into her emerald eyes for a moment and then kissed hr briefly i love you i love you too james dontworry a short ways away alice and frank were also exchanging sentiments who knows what this sudden and dangerous battle could bring as if in slow motion dumbledore tapped the door and unlocked it the uneven and bent bars slowly creaked open to permit their entry lily closed her eyes briefly laid her head against james shoulder and marched in after the others as if sensing their presence a dozen dementors suddenly swooped out from a demolished lookign garage lily felt the sudden douse of coldness snatch at her breath and she summoned the image of her and james wedding with a swish of her wand and a loudly uttered charm she sent her cat shaped patronus reeling out into the darkening night several dementors stumbled and glided away as a flurry of patronuses flew at them yet soon many fresh ones were upon them and the fighting truly began lily didnteven notice that death eaters had joined the fight until one of them rounded on her with a harsh orange colored light narrowly dodging it lily stumbled to the ground where she countered with a stunning hex the spell caught the hooded figure by surprise and sent it catapulting to the ground lily leapt to her feet only to be met with a nasty looking dementor the creature circled her briefly then threw itself upon her grasping with it scabby hands lily choked on it rancid breath as she struggled to aim her wand just as her senses began leaking away a loud reprimendation cleared her horrifying memories and she was suddenly released she glanced up sorely to see remus lupin chasing the dementor away with his patronus thanks remus she mumbled struggling to her feet he didntanswer but stared numbly in the direction of the house lily followed his gaze only to experiance the feeling of lead in her stomach as an enormous foot found ground just meters in front of them stunning curses at the count of three sirius bellowed but only a few feeble beams of light met his command many of their fellow attackers had been knocked out or were despereately duelling with a death eater lily and remus watched in horror as the giant drew closer followed by two others then instinct kicked in impendimenta lily cried throwing herself out of the creature way remus narrowly dodged it crushing footstep as it slowed down before their eyes before remus could thank her lily dashed at a death eater bearing down on james who was hunched on the ground blood spilling from a gash on his forehead sirius was crouching beside him a bruise welling up over his right eye stupefy lily shouted directing the curse at her friend and husband attacker unfortunately the death eater had followed sirius hopeful gaze at lily and managed to block the spell just in time the cloaked figure let out a harsh laugh and lily recognized it as a female voice oh the little mudblood come to play now has she she cackled james made a violent movement but was kicked back by the woman lily met the eyes glinting from underneath the hood with a hard stare what no pathetic begging dontyou want me to spare your precious little friends lily couldntthink of what to do if she attacked the woman would merely block it and sirius and james were at an angle that they could be hit by the riccochet fine then the woman sneered when lily showed no sign of response avada no lily shrieked the woman stopped and gave a short laugh she opened her mouth lips forming the words crucio when another cloaked figure apparated beside her lily felt her such an intense feeling of dread as this man stared at her with his cruel red eyes that she almsot wondered if she was already dead i ll take care of them bella i ve been looking forward to torturing some filthy mudblood i ll take care of these two as well voldemort spoke in his cold voice lily looked around desperately willing someone anyone to help them dumbledore had his back turned to them busy subedueing the giants remus was duelling with two death eaters at once sturgis podmore was lying on the ground as a dementor lowered it hood to him mad eye was laying unconcious on the grass and peter was nowhere in sight the others were also too busy either bleeding or fighting lily felt tears of fright well up in her eyes voldemort let out a high laugh obviously taking note of her fear in one swift moment he transformed a rock into a port key and forced them al towards it lily felt a dazed feeling momentarily take over her mind as she thoughtlessly approached the stone and pressed her hand onto it then as the portkey jerked into action swirling them all to somewhere unknown lily felt a renewed battle for her life begin a n

that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 25 padfoot treachery lily stumbled as her feet slammed back onto solid ground and she toppled into sirius knocking him over james quickly snatched her hand and pulled her up hiding her behind him for once lily didntargue with his over protectiveness they appeared to be in an old house moldy curtains were the only sign of furnishing in the room and the only door was tightly closed and locked lily was too numb with fear to even think straight sure they had faced voldemort before but they hadntknown it was him now here he was staring at them mercilessly with his cruel red eyes he then lowered his hood smirking dangerously his appearence was even more hideous then lily could have ever imagined his skin was pale and only a few wispy strands of black hair remained on his head his nose was flattened with slit like nostrils and his mouth consisted of thin lips he was quite tall yet his his features were all hardened and bitter still worst of all were his eyes scarlett and flashing with a vehemence that they could inspire fear in the bravest of people shaking lily grabbed onto james arm voldemort let out a loud high pitched laugh foolish mudblood you think your pathetic excuse for a husband can save you oh yes i know all about you you see lord voldemort knows all he cackled lily trembled wondering how he had known she and james were married know you re no lord sirius spat holding his wand in front of him aiming directly at the place where voldemort heart would be voldemort laughed yet again seemingly amused at this display of resillance lily flinched when he withdrew his wand expecting him to torture of kill sirius but instead she was surprised when voldemort next spoke it was in a softer voice a more persuasive one come and join us black you re powers have always been greater then those who you considered your equals your noble blood would be worshipped amongst my followers come and join me and i can offer you power and respect you ve never known before sirius looked taken aback by his offer but immediatly retorted i would never join you fine voldemort replied simply his eyes flashing maybe you need a little more convincing he aimed his wand at james crucio sirius watched in horror as james was knocked off his feet and fell to the ground writhing with pain lily immediatly dropped down to the ground beside him and grabbed his arm james she whispered james voldemort laughed his loudest yet at this and lily felt a fury rise within in her that she had never known before turning to face the towering dark wizard she screamed expelliarmus emotion echoed in every syllable of her spell and miraculously voldemort wand flew from his grasp james screams stopped and for a moment all four of them remained paralyzed with shock at this lack of control then sense kicked in lily lunged forwards and cried accio wand but voldemort was too quick for her with one swift moment his foot met her stomach and she was sent careening back towards james eyes watering with pain lily looked up sorely to see that voldemort had managed to retrieve his wand sirius was still standing like a statue his face white and his lips pursed stupid mudblood you think you can defeat me with your mediocre spells your pathetic unworthy snivelling low class blood let me teach you a lesson cru voldemort hissed but was interrupted by sirius with the force of a charging bull their friend had hurled himself at voldemort recovering quickly as he was knocked to the ground voldemort waved his wand and sirius went flying back into the wall he laughed again dontyou see you can never defeat me voldemort cried a maniacal joy lit within his voice lily stared in horror at him her mind working furiously how could they escape before lily could do anything though sirius spoke up in a low croaking voice full of pain and was it sorrow if i join your legions he began pain stakingly will you let them go voldemort turned to the crumpled man his features lighting up with malice of course he hissed slyly lily could hear the lie embedded within his words but she was still too shocked at sirius offer to do anything james seemed to be thinking along the same lines sirius no he yelled his voice echoeing hollowly around the small room sirius faced his friends grimly it the only way besides he right i am worth more then you lily gaped at the man she had considered her friend was he defying them now in perhaps their darkest hour voldemort however was looking quite pleased that right he hissed i see you ve finally gotten the point your ancient blood lines are worth far more then any mudbloods or those who choose to marry a mudblood sirius keeping his eyes downcast replied in a tone of glee yes yes my lord make me one of your devoted servants know brand me with your royal mark and i shall do your bidding no lily screamed tears now streaming down her face shut your mouth sirius snarled just as voldemort cried crucio it was pain beyond pain lily had never experianced such a feeling before pain bit at every inch of her body as if knives were being plumetted into her body over and over again she was so absorbed in the terror and sheer echoeing pain of it that she wasnteven aware of her own screams filling the room then as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and lily became numbly aware of someone at her side clutching desperately onto her hand through her watering eyes lily could make out the distinct outline of james glasses somewhere above her shaking her head she saw that he was crying such a fear possesed her for she had never seen him lose control like this almost as horrible as the pain she had experainced moments before was the fear she was feeling now a hopeless desire for escape yet the helplessness of the death sure to come to them in only moments time voldemort she knew would never keep his promises and sirius he had betrayed them with slow painful movements lily pulled herself into a sitting position and searched the room with her eyes voldemort was in the corner speaking in low whispers with sirius who she was horrified to see held both james and her wands clutched in his hands had she been so blinded by pain that she hadnteven noticed him taking it from her lily i sure he just trying to save us james whispered into her ear lily leaned into his chest knowing that he was desperate to believe any reason for his best friend treachery but she couldntsee how that was the case sirius would surely know that voldemort would never let them leave alive no matter what vows he made perhaps sirius had been the spy all along had he turned to voldeemort before and was the reason for the ambush on headquarters so many months ago was he responsible for all the recent deaths had he always been the one who had betrayed them and now was staging this so that voldemort could now finish off lily and james his desire to kill them must have surely increased since the time they had escaped him back in the june of their graduating year lily panicked desperate thoughts were soon interrupted by sirius who was now approaching them voldemort lily could see was watching with a hungry expression in his greedy eyes he wants you to duel sirius told them loudly offering their wands back to them he going to prove his worth over you james and lily remained motionless staring blankly at their ex friend make them take them voldemort called impatiently from behind sirius or i ll have to miss out on the joy of torturing them and simply kill them now sirius glanced briefly at his new master then turned back to lily and james take them he commanded in a superior demanding voice yet somehow lily saw his coldness didntreach his eyes his dark brown eyes were filled with a pleading a last flicker of hope burning inside them trustingly lily reached forwards but was stopped by james who seized her wrist fine if they are too cowardly to duel then i shall finish them now step aside black voldemort commanded striding forwards instead of obliging sirius forced the wand into james hand and lily grabbed hers with her free hand the last thing she saw before being whirled away was sirius still clutching the end of james wand transporting himself along with them 00000 for the second time that day lily felt her feet slamming into the hard ground and she crumpled to the ground making no move to try and break her fall still sore from the battle and exhaustion residing in every one of her muscles she couldntmove even if she had wanted to her mind too was wearied beyond belief from the internal battle she had waged deciding whether of not to trust sirius she knew now that she had made the right decision by dropping his pride sirius had saved all three of their lives lily james sirius a soft voice asked from above what happened are you okay lily turned pain stakingly onto her side to see remus lupin hunched above their still bodies moony james exclaimed joyfully from lily left what happened came peter voice he sounded quite confused where did you er go we were attacked sirius gasped as lily pulled herself to her feet with help from remus she then bent down and helped james up then sirius thanks he mumbled we were attacked by voldemort involuntary shudders resounded around the small group in the distance lily could see dumbledore tending to some of the injured the giants were nowhere in sight likewise with the death eaters how did you escape remus asked weakly sirius saved us lily said speaking for the first time everyone attention turned to her he pretended to go over to his side so that he could help us escape more easily peter stared soundlessly at sirius who shrugged we owe you our lives padfoot i sorry i mistrusted you james said solemnly lily nodded to show her thanks as well sirius let out his bark like laugh no problem but dontexpect me to do anything like that again i dontever want to go within fifty feet of that wizard again this seemed to lighten the mood as dumbledore hurried over to their small group was it him he asked simply blue eyes flashing with alarm lily nodded as james retold their story to dumbledore once he was finished dumbledore was looking very grim i hope you will now realize that this recent battle will have put you three at an even greater risk for voldemort attacks after escaping him twice he will seek you with a thirst i can not even begin to fathom you will need to be on vigilant alert from now on he explained quietly i understand sir sirius said calmly and james and lily nodded mutely dumbledore smiled encouragingly dontlose hope there is a chance that you might not even run into him ever again now drink this he waved his wand and three potions came flying towards them from the ground where the other lay and you ll be restored to full strength i suggest you all return home immediatly and get some rest i have already sent your friends home it is not wise for mrs alice longbottom to exert herself so much during this time sir what are you talki lily began but dumbledore raised his hand to stop her that is up to her to tell you when she ready she may not even know herself yet he said eyes twinkling fondly you ll see what i mean in good time er okay lily

read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 26 dawn of life painfully lily slipped out of bed and got changed she was still extremely sore from the battle against voldemort yesterday then slowly she made her way to the bathroom to get ready for work she would have much rather lay in bed with james all day staying within the comfort of their warm soft bed but auror lessons must be attended besides james couldntfall behind now that he had just begun after completing her morning preparation ritual lily headed back into the bedroom and strode over to where james was sound asleep gently she shook him james time to get up she said softly no response rolling her eyes lily picked up her wand off the bedstand and focused her mind on a certain spell in an instant a loud firecracker burst from the wand and went off with a bang if lily had not been used to james deep sleep disorder she would have been shocked that he still gave no sign of awakening finally lily turned to her last resort giving her wand an elegant twirling wave she muttered aguamenti and a spurt of water sprayed out from the end of her wand the shower of cold water splattered directly onto james face and spluttering he jolted into a sitting position what in bloody hell was that for he cursed angrily lily scowled at him impatiently and jerked her head towards the alarm clock for a moment he stared indignantly at the clock then finally gave in with a sheepish smile he apologized and hurried to get ready by the time james was ready to go the two of them only had about five minutes to get to the ministry and to the classrooms see you later love james bid kissing his wife on the cheek lily smiled and returned the sentiment then the two of them apparated to work 000 lily strolled out of the classroom several hours later feeling famished the group had just been practicing fatiguing spells and to say the least they didntexactly have a positive after effect lily mind however was not on her weariness but on alice she had not turned up for lessons that day at first lily had suspected she might be on another junior mission for the last few months her frank and a few others had embarked on simple missions due to their pronounced advancement in their auror education but the professor would have surely mentioned something he was always rubbing it in the others faces that they unlike his star pupils were not good enough to do quests for the ministry yet lily would have been amongst the few doing the extra tasks as she had the highest marks in her auror classes but she always turned them down she wanted to fully complete all her courses before actually tackling the field work she had been that way since she started at hogwarts she had even refused flying lessons until she had covered enough books on the sport now in training for her job she was no different in that aspect lily a voice called spinning around lily saw that she was being trailed by frank she sighed in relief finally she could put her mind at rest hey frank where alice lily said trying to sound cheerful rather then exhausted frank smiled grimly that what i wanted to talk to you about she really sick and when she get sick well she tends to get really cranky i was wondering if you could maybe come over and cheer her up lily laughed lightly of course i ll be over in a second i just have to send an owl to james okay thanks see you in a moment then frank replied sounding a little happier and then he apparated from the hallway feeling quite amused at alice antics lily hurriedly located an owl and sent it off with a message for james then she too apparated from the ministry 000 with increasing frustration james hacked away at his fretwool vines in his current class he was supposed to be creating a face disguising potion which was supposed to an electric blue in color but so far all james was managing was a bright pink mess normally he would have done fine working with potions but at the moment his mind was on his and lily last night exploit of ardor his pleasent reverie however was soon interrupted by the ever pesky professor patil mr potter do you recall what happens when you cut fretwool vines in vertical cuts he asked snottishly james strained his memory back to the previous morning er they grow back thicker that is correct now may i ask why you wish to thicken the roots you are supposed to be dicing the ministry professor continued i forgot james replied tersely begin again and with new roots mr potter feeling angry and impatient james chucked his ruined vines in the rubbish bin and collected new ones then vanishing his previous concoction he began a new one a few hours later james emerged from the dimly lit room sweaty faced and tired he could really do with some marauder humour at the moment therefore it came as a convinence when lily letter arrived bringing news of her visit to alice s in a much brighter mood james apparated to sirius house 000 alice lily called enthusiastically i brought chocolate lily stood in the landing removing her travelling cloak as she waited for alice to appear it didnttake long lily her friend called back merrily lily smiled as alice led her to the living room it really nice of you to drop by how did you know i was ill today franks gone out to visit a few friends so we can have some nice private girl talk oh and thanks for bringing some chocolate by you dontknow how much i ve been craving it lately woah slow down lily exclaimed feeling bemused as she held up her hands in a halting gesture and for one frank told me you were sick for two it no problem coming by and all that alice laughed sorry that okay lily replied offering her friend the chocolate so how are you feeling mmmm alice mused taking a bite of a chocolate frog alright i feel better then i did this morning anyways well that good you probably just caught the flu or something lily stated helping herself to a frog as well yeah my partner in stealth class recently had it so that probably it alice commented sounding quite indifferent then she paused momentarily studying a chocolate frog she had just unwrapped you know this is missing something hang on i ve got just the thing feeling slightly taken aback lily waited patiently for alice to return from the kitchen finally alice re emmerged and to lily bewilderment she was carrying a large jar of pickles er alice what are you doing lily asked eyes wide as she stared at alice invention she had removed several pickle slices from the container and crammed them into her mouth alongside the chocolate eating you should try it it actually tastes pretty good alice replied smiling mischieviously lily wrinkled her nose in disgust no thanks what gotten into you anyways frank said you ve been in a bad mood all day and now you re eating pickles and chocolate you hate pickles no i don t alice said simply munching on another chockle mmmm hmmm lily mumbled feeling unconvinced however alice didntseem to want to discuss it any further so lily changed the subject hey do you know what dumbledore was talking about yesterday about me alice asked lily nodded curiously and alice shrugged no clue although he might have caught wind of me complaining to frank earlier i had just mentioned i wasntfeeling all too great oh lily said quietly she sensed something different about the alice in front of her know like something had changed however she couldntseem to quite place it shaking this thought from her mind she and alice continued to converse from things as simple as the latest robe trends to the more complex issues about their lovelives soon it was dark outside oh merlin look at the time lily said glancing at a large grandfather clock on the wall opposite to them alice smiled yeah it is pretty late anyways thanks for coming by lily it was really thoughtful of you lily made to return her friend smile but she stopped when she saw alice eyes all watery what the matter lily exclaimed feeling slightly alarmed alice shrugged and wiped impatiently at her eyes sorry i guess i just really tired er okay then lily replied cautiously then after embracing each other in a quick hug lily went back outside and apparated home 000 the next morning arrived sooner then lily would have liked groggily she stretched her hand outside the blankets and hit the sleep button then she curled back up against james prepared to spend an extra ten minutes alongside his warmth she would have managed this had a wave of sudden nausea not overcome her catapulting out of bed as fast as her sleep ridden legs would allow lily barely made it to the toilet before she lost the contents of her stomach slumping against the bathtub she listened to james slow footprints as he made his way to the bathroom obviously awoken by her sudden movement are you okay love he asked sounding quite concerned lily opened her mouth to answer but before she could utter a word she vomited again into the toilet flushing it miserably she allowed james to help her up i guess i ve caught alice flu lily mumbled sulkily james helped her back to bed and pulled the covers back up to her chin then he laid his hand across her forehead weird he commented you donthave a fever lily shrugged not really caring about her symptoms now all she knew was that she was sick and wouldntbe able to go into auror training today she wished the sick feeling in her stomach would go away well i ve got to get going are you going to be okay alone today james continued i ll be fine lily sighed james smiled encouragingly at her and kissed her forehead good get some rest now and you ll be better before you know it as james got ready and left lily bad temper increased although the sickness went away around noon her temper persisted she kept getting mad at stupid things like when she accidentally knocked her wand off the side table and she had to go across the room to retrieve it or at the ticking noise the clock seemed to be making louder then usual lily was just lying down on the sofa in the living room reading a book when the doorbell rang impatiently she hurried to answer it expecting it to be james checking up on her or something but she was surprised yet pleased to find callidora and cadence on the doorstep with her friend keeping her comapany time passed rapidly and lily soon bid them goodbye feeling much better as evening settled she hastily threw together a quick dinner and waited for james to arrive home after supper ham with mashed potatoes and corn lily was ready for an early night james obliged and the two retired at a mere eight o clock the next morning lily awoke feeling one hundred percent healthy happily she awoke james in her usual watery fashion and scurried about getting ready she was just about ready to head out the door when that familiar nauseaous feeling overwhelemed her again not again she groaned hurrying past james on the stairs and back into the bathroom again she was lucky and made it to the toilet in time almost as if it were deja vu lily waited in the same fashion as she had yesterday for james to come in sick again he asked incredulously and lily nodded maybe you should see a doctor you re flushed and all but you said that you only feel sick for a little bit and then you re fine that really quite odd but i dontfeel sick enough to go to the doctors lily protested grumpily great her temper was flaring up again okay okay sorry it was just a suggestion james surrendered as he helped lily back to bed again i know i sorry lily sighed knowing she shouldnthave snapped i just hate being sick and to her surprise lily felt tears flooding to her eys again before she knew it she was sobbing into james shoulder lily shhh it just a flu you ll be fine i know i sorry i being st stupid lily choked james patted her on the back soothingly but suddenly lily felt as though she were about to retch again pushing james aside she made to head to the bathroom but it was already too late james quickly vanished the mess from the floor and surveyed lily shrewdly once again he checked her temperature lily i going to take the day off of work okay and i going to take you to s james said firmly why lily asked do i have a fever no that what bugs me james said please james i ll be fine i dontneed the healers honestly lily pleaded hospitals always made her feel uncomfertable no i really think you should go what if it the after effects of a spell that hit you and alice at the battle with the giants a few days ago besides if you re not cured you re going to miss a lot of auror classes james argued persuasively lily considered all of this for a moment then finally gave fine she sighed reluctantly and allowed james to help her get ready 000 stick your tongue out a short kindly looking healer told lily obediently lily obliged the elderly witch studied the inside of her mouth for a moment while a quill took notes without human assistance on the table beside them james was waiting patiently outside so you ve been having mood swings and sudden bouts of nausea is this correct the healer asked as she picked up the clip board and studied the notes lily nodded mutely when was the last time you had intercourse with your husband the witch asked abruptly lily almost fell off the examination table in shock p pardon she studdered the healer smiled at her and while turning red lily answered her question i dunno a few days ago and then maybe a week or two before that i see and have you missed your period at all the healer pressed not sure where this was leading lily exclaimed now that you mention it mrs potter do you think you can diagnose yourself what lily asked confused then suddenly something in her mind clicked oh merlin she gasped the healer smile broadly at her let me be the first to extend my congragulations she grinned shall i fetch your husband lily nodded emerald eyes wide as the joy and fear of the news began to sink in she was pregnant she was going to be a mother she was going to have a baby her and james were going to be parents james entered the room looking thoroughly confused the healer shot lily an encouraging smile and then left the two of them alone so james began are you okay is it the flu lily tried to speak honestly she did but words failed her all she managed was to nod again she seemed to be doing a lot of that lately well are you going to tell me james pressed curiously lily threw her arms around him and james stumbled backwards in surprise lily what going on james we re going to be parents lily croaked eyes brimming with tears of happiness what are you talking about james asked in disbelief i pregnant lily said simply letting the glorious words settle upon them as in you re going to have a baby james asked still looking unconviced lily smiled and squealed james we re having a baby for a moment james was silent then as the joy kicked in he embraced lily picked her up and swung her around once blimey i cantbelieve it he muttered eyes unfocused as he thought more about it lily smiled ecstatically and stared into james eyes for a few touching moments the couple stood there drowning in joy at the realization then james leaned in and they shared a joyous kiss 000 later that night after collecting mounds of paperwork on the subject lily was found hurrying to answer the door swinging open the door she was immediatly bowled down by alice tears of happiness streaked down their cheeks as both women exchanged the news and even later as lily lay in bed alongside james that night she reflected on the irony of it she and her best friend were going to be mothers at the same time she felt more elated then she had ever believed possible she was going to have a baby with the man she loved it was really the beginning of their new life together and soon another life would join the one they already had so this lily thought is truly the dawn of life a

began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 27 in the face of flames callidora prewett made her way between the stands hastily and headed for the changing room on the opposite side of the pitch she was five minutes late thanks to james and lily stupid owl the big white faced barn owl had arrived just as she was heading out the door so as to deliver it letter already in a rush and in no mood to sit down and read she had hurriedly grabbed it from the owl beak and tossed it on the table plannng to read it later unfortunately for her the owl known as basil had other ideas mainly to have his letter read immediatly so impatiently and under influence of razor sharp talons she had taken the dratted thing and quickly scanned it callidora and cadence james and i have the most exciting news to share with you as do alice and frank you might be able to guess but we d love to discuss it in person with you do you think you can both get friday night off work and come over for dinner alice and frank will be there and then we can all talk please reply as soon as you possibly can though because james and i need to know in advance when to book our night off from auror training love always lily now as callidora swung upon the doors to the kenmare kestral changing room she felt a peculiar curiosity about the letter what was it that was so important that they actually had to be there for lily to tell them surely it must be about there auror training after all callidora thought both the longbottoms and the potters were taking the training now calli shook her thoughts off quickly as she greeted her fellow team mates they were a wonderful bunch and had provided her with quite a few new friendships but she still missed lily and alice they her and cadence had all been so close before their lives got so tangled up in their jobs and relationships i guess it had to happen sooner of later callidora muttered bitterly as she changed into her quidditch robes the thing that was bugging her was that alice and lily were married and cadence in a serious relationship with sirius while she had had hardly any love in her life lately she wouldnthave minded except for the fact that she spent a lot of time alone now cadence was always at sirius and of course the others were moved in with their spouses five minutes everybody team captain marcus wellforth announced loudly there was a last minute flurry of activity as everybody scurried to gather their equipment callidora quickly jammed her chaser gloves onto her forearms and hands and followed her teamates out the door and back into the sunlight alright everybody here marcus asked performing a quick head count there was a murmur of yes and he grinned broadly at them well we ve got a big game coming up ladies and gentlemen it crucial that we win this one so i want to see you all playing at your best now when we get up in the air i want to see some good quality playing beaters take out the bludgers and work around the chasers kay the seeker let out the snitch as do the usual try some of the new manouveres were practiced the other day while you re at it warren us chasers are going to try and score on you any questions when no one answered he flashed them another wide smile and beckoned for them to begin their assent callidora launched herself into the air and let the air blow through her hair joyously on her broomstick she felt impeccably light and care free not a worry in the world calli shouted kenneth one of the beaters callidora snapped her eyes open just to see a bludger hit her smack dab in the forehead tumbling off her broom which thankfully hadntbeen too high off the ground yet she felt her body contact the ground with a soft thudding noise are you okay kenneth asked landing beside the fallen girl and helping her up squinting through blurry vision callidora viewed his worried face i f fine she studdered still feeling winded from her fall i really sorry i thought i was sure everyone was aware i was letting them out he apologized callidora gave a shaky laugh it no problem really i wasntpaying attention kenneth smiled understandingly rough day so far yes well maybe after practice i can take you out for coffee he asked lightly calli felt a flutter in her stomach as she gazed into his soft brown eyes he looked adorable with his wind swept honey brown hair and heart warming smile besides he was absolutely the sweetest guy she d ever met how could she say no besides hadntshe just been thinking about how unlucky her love life had been s sure i d like that she finally replied smiling earnestly great well we d better carry on or marcus will be on our cases i ll wait for you outside the changing room kenneth asked sweetly sounds good calli assured him and feeling rather pleased she hurried back to her broomstick and mounted it 00000 come on buckbeak cadence cooed offering a mushy bowl of who knows what to the adolescent hippogriff the over sized bird eyed his breakfast with contempt and trotted off to the other side of the pasture cadence sighed wiping the hair out of her eyes hippogriff matured slowly and consequently buckbeak was being weaned at a much later stage then most creatures having much luck asked cadence aunt merion as the woman came out of the barn levitating two more buckets of mush before her no cadence said shooting the bird a contemptuous glance he still being a feathery git her aunt laughed with amusement well no one said training and raising hippogriff is an easy job i know this wasntexactly your job of choice but you re good with animals all you need is a little patience well i dontthink a little patience is going to cut it i think i going to need about a bucketful he just so stubborn cadence insisted determined to be in a bad mood just like you merion summer remarked slyly cadence peered at her aunt determinedly straight face with a forced offended look but even she wouldnthave bought it oh i guess you re right cadence finally admitted why do you bother with all this hippogriff stuff anyways i mean it a cool job and all but i mean it not exactly common well her aunt answered thoughtfully there a surprisingly high demand for the sevices magical creatures can supply you know the ministry uses them occasionally for transportation of azkaban convicts although that becoming increasingly less common and then proffesor dumbledore of hogwarts school asks for them occasionally for the school care of magical creature courses someone has to raise and tame the beasts for this sortof of stuff and since your uncle and i enjoyed working with animals it was the perfect job for us hmm interesting cadence commented disinterestedly she spent a moment a of silence watching buckbeak gallop around his pen searching for his usual food supply of baby hippogriff formula well honey you d better get home it getting late and with all those death eaters and dementors out aunt merion said with a shudder cadence nodded relieved she didnthave to have another go with bribing a stubborn buckbeak i ll have to show him to sirius sometime they d probably get along great cadence thought to herself jokingly well thanks auntie see you tomorrow cadence said feeling much cheerier at getting off early with a last wave she apparated back to the flat 00000 you re home early a smiling callidora remarked as cadence let herself into the apartment yeah aunt merion let me go early how come you re so cheery cadence replied suspiciously you didntclean my room again did you no calli laughed i dontthink i have the courage to go in there again but anyways kenneth warbeck asked me out today cadence eyes suddenly sparkled with interest really she gushed and who is he again you met him that once he the beater the really cute one with the sandy brown hair and eyes oh yeah hey enough drooling cadence joked smiling at her friend obvious delight so did you already go out or are you both calli said simply he took me to the local wizarding teashop and now we ve got arrangements for saturday night oh and that reminds me we re going to lily and james place on friday there a letter on the table really cadence asked curiously walking over to the table and picking up the sheet of parchment with lily handwriting on it quickly she read it over that weird i wonder what it all about i dunno calli said with a shrug just make sure you get friday evening off okay i talked to alice earlier and she wouldntspill but it seems really important fine cadence said with a wave of her hand her aunt merion probably wouldnteven notice if she didntshow up friday but she d let her know anyways anyways i kindof hungry you up for going out callidora offered it on me sounds good cadence replied with a grin so quickly the two witches gathered their cloaks and headed off for a nearby small restaurant 00000 i dontfeel so well cadence complained rubbing her aching stomach as she walked callidora rolled her eyes as she strolled alongside of her over fed friend i told you not to order that extra dish of kidney pudding yeah and i told you not to where a white cloak cadence retorted directing her gaze to the bright red stain that had appeared on the clothing just that evening from a glass of spilt fire whiskey whatever calli said exasperatedly the two girls were taking a short walk up the street in order to work off some of their food induced weariness as they headed further up the street the crisp autumn air suddenly smelt of smoke and ash callidora stopped and cocked her head noticing this as the air become hazy from smoke what going on cadence asked a subtle note of alarm in her voice shhh calli hushed pressing a finger to her lips both girls remained silent for a moment and soon the sound of panicked cries met their ears come on cadence shouted leaping forwards into the run and heading for the source of disruption drawing wands as they ran it soon become apparant to the pair of them that this was no innocent fire the dark mark was soon to be found looming above a small cottage on the outskirts of the small town oh no callidora moaned eyeing the ruined muggle building with a great sadness hesitating briefly they then charged towards the burning building aguamenti cadence cried brandishing her wand at a tower of swirling flames blocking the entrance water poured from her wand in burst and drenched the fire leaving it a spitting pile of ash callidora and cadence cautiously crept inside the structure praying it wouldntcome down on top of them there got to be someone in here calli shouted desperately we heard screaming as if on cue a shrill scream was uttered from the upper floor cadence and calli exchanged a look of fear do you want me to go cadence offered tensely no it okay i can take care of it you go outside and guard the building from any death eaters that might still be around calli shouted in reply the rushing noise of the flames blocked out almost all noise making it difficult to hear there was no time to argue and reluctantly cadence turned back and made her way out through the billowing black smoke she stumbled out of the house and let the autumn breeze refresh her burning nose which still stung from the acrid smell radiating from the cottage good luck calli cadence shouted her voice carrying helplessly in the breeze as she prayed for her friends saftey for a moment she lay still on the heated grass listening to the fury of the flames and her friend battled for her life and possibly the lives of others a n sorry this chapter took awhile to get up i had minor problems with my word program although it only lasted a day my main excuse is that i merely took a bit of time off school work is so hectic i really just needed to take a break or risk writer block i feel this chapter was pretty good i hope you all do too i ve got bit of a gap in my plot line to fill and i feel i should let you all get to know the other characters better which is why this and the next few chapters are going to be focused around lily and james friends well anyways i really hope you enjoy this and please drop a line and tell me what you think oh and just in case anyone is interested i ve given this chapter the title in the face of flames for two reasons the most obvious is because of the fire at the end and the second reason is because love can be a very fiery passionate and entrancing thing as is the fire and callidora might just be stepping into that well ttyl before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the

screeched into the raging flames there was no answer only the roaring sounds of the flames consuming it surroundings could be heard in the dense smoke covering her air passages with the sleeve of her robes callidora navigated further into the soldering cottage stepping over the rubbish of a charred sofa she strained her ears for the slightest bit of noise praying that only her and the victims were left in the ruined house she was sure no death eaters would be hanging about inhaling the smoke for so long but just in case she held her wand at the ready callidora remained wandering aimlessly through the flames for about two more minutes there were no more screams and the building was becoming increasingly unstable with a spluttering sigh she turned to head out the door but there was something blocking her way it took her burning eyes about two minutes to make the figure out through the heat waves the fire emitted but when she finally got a clear picture her limbs turned to ice it couldntbe why would they chance it why would they linger callidora thought desperately as the death eater side stepped a burning table and approached her you re one of the mudbloods too the wizard asked a snarl inside his voice paralyzed with tingling fear callidora shook her head furiously then who are you the man demanded his eyes glinting maliciously from under his hood calli remained silent as fear ran through her veins the death eater seemed to become impatient as the flames licked even higher up the walls and the roof began to crumble who are you he roared the figure drew his wand and instantly calli instincts kicked in with a running leap she bounded over a small huddle of flames blocking the hallway and somehow managed to find her way to the staircase through the scattered flames and hovering smoke help someone cried from upstairs calli felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end just what she needed to be in a burning building with a death eater on her tail and a helpless muggle to rescue just great i coming stay where you are calli shouted praying to merlin that the death eater wouldnttrack the sound of her voice suddenly an idea occured to her bounding up the stairs as her lungs screamed for pure oxygen she perched herself on the top of the unstable stairs and waited two seconds three seconds four seconds avada the death eater cried jumping into view but calli was too quick for him reducto she cried sending a jet of light through the smoke and towars the landing across from her and overtop the man with a loud crash the rubble crushed the death eater calli heard a crief scream and it was over i killed someone callidora thought appalled i actually killed someone the intense heat interrupted her shaky thoughts and she rememebred about the muggle trapped somewhere up here re gathering her courage she charged on following the sounds of weak sobbing callidora found two muggle children and their mother huddled together in the bathtub it okay i ll get you out calli yelled in what she hoped was a reassuring voice choking she grabbed what was left of a burning towel and shoved it under the sink praying that it still worked to her relief cool water quickly spurted onto the clothes and she pulled it back and draped it over the children c mon follow me moving slightly slower now calli managed to direct the small family out into the hallway narrowly dodging a fallen beam hot with red embers the mother suddenly let out a high pitched scream and fainted callidora looked to the spot her gaze had been the moment before passing out and felt a wave of naseau creep over her there lying crushed under a flame ridden railing was the the father or so she assumed thinking quickly calli covered the children eyes and using magic levitated the mum back to the staircase she gasped as realization hit her when she had killed the death eater she has blocked the staircase with debris oh no she moaned feeling panicky as the fire and smoke closed in on them is there another way out she desperately asked the older of the two daughters she nodded mutely and pointed down the hall without hesitation callidora grabbed the girls hand and hefted her brother into her arms still levitating the woman she made her way to what had surely been the master bedroom frantically looking around she spotted that their only way out was through a large window shielded by flames setting down the boy gently she aimed her wand at the fiery obstacle aguamenti she screamed her voice hoarse from smoke and ash the kids gaped silently as the flames fizzled and were reduced to small heaps of rubbish come on calli urged helping them to the window and opening it with one great heave she set the unconcious mother on the edge of the window turn around she ordered the frightened kids who obeyed reluctantly with a deep breath calli pushed the woman out of the window and immediatly whipped her wand wingardium leviosa to calli relief the mum began floating just inches before hitting the ground hardly wasting a moment for large chunks of the roof were now raining from the ceiling calli snatched the boy up and tossed him out he gave a soft cry of surprise before genlty levitating to the ground beside his mother callidora whipped around for the last time and in one heart stopping moment saw that the girl had vanished oh no calli thought with alarm as she noticed small ashy footprints leading back into the hall way come back er kid she cried anxiously as if in reply calli heard a soft whimpering she hurried past a cloud of smoke and dodged another falling roof beam and finally made it to where the girl sat huddled over her father lifeless body tiny blistering hands genlty prodded her fathers pale face daddy the girl sobbed gazing up at calli with tear filled round eyes callidora felt a rush of terrible sadness overwhelm her and a few tears streaked down her ash covered face come with me calli said gently reaching forward to take the girls hand for a moment the toddler stared at her offered hand and then reached forward slowly callidora fingertips were inches from the girls when suddenly another flaming rafter came crashing down no calli screamed as the girl paused and glanced up snapping her eyes shut callidora gave a moan of remorse as the beam came down upon the child hiding her body from view except for one now lifeless stretched out hand for one horrible moment callidora remained crouched beside the two dead muggles terror reflecting in her wide blue eyes even as glass shattered all around her from the intensity of the flaming heat calli had only one thought circling her blank mind i couldntsave her calli came someone distant but desperate cry hazily standing up calli realized that it was cadence voice calling for her from out back but an enormous amount of smoke had already invaded her lungs and shock slowed her brain functions taking a small step forward mental and physical exhaustion overloaded calli senses trembling in her weariness she collapsed and small lights danced infront of her eyes with a shuddering sigh everything went black 00000 how about abigail if it a girl james suggested lightly as he shuffled through a sheaf of papers both he and lily were taking a break from reading the vital but otherwise dull pregnancy information papers instead of tirelessly going through suggestions and warnings they were considering names for their soon to be baby girl or boy no too old fashioned lily said with her nose wrinkled james shrugged and flipped to the b names wait what about adriel james asked flipping back a page as a name caught his eye lily considered this for a moment that pretty she admitted thoughtfully for a girl that is james nodded we ll keep it in mind then yes but i going to write down a list so we can remember lily responded pulling a quill and piece of parchment towards her in neat handwriting she added adriel under the girl column ignoring james as he rolled his eyes at her organization skills i still cantbelieve i have to drop out of auror training lily muttered we ve been through this james replied firmly there is no way that under the cirumstances i can continue auror training it too stressful and even dangerous lily said in a mocking voice finishing off james admonishment it just that it was going to be my career you know i didntstrive to get an outstanding in all of my owls for nothing i know lily but we have to think about what best for the baby now james soothed her gently he gave a fond glance at lily still flat belly and you re going to have to drop the whole order of the phoenix thing too lily jaw dropped and she made to retort but james cut her off please just for a little while the order is even more dangerous then auror training what would we do if you got hit by a spell and we lost the baby lily sighed i guess she mumbled james smiled and gave her a gentle kiss it ll be okay love just think we re going to be parents lily smiled back at him fine but if i have to be the stay at home mom you re going to have to teach it quidditch wizard chess and all that good stuff and i dontwant any of that marauder nonsense lily told him bossily he rolled his eyes in play of course not lily glared at him and james gave her a sheepish grin lily gave way and gave a soft giggle leading to a flurry of kisses from james the two basked on the sofa sharing in the anticipation of this new love 00000 alice longbottom do you hereby accept all responsibilities regulations and consequences of becoming an auror asked the minister for magic in a deep serious voice i do alice answered solemnly her hand hovering over the large auror book of rules both her and frank had recieved quite the surprise that afternoon being as frank was the top in his auror classes and alice was his wife they were both being sworn to aurorhood years earlier then planned the ministry was rapidly losing aurors on their side to the fight against voldemort and as a result they were in desperate need of recruits that why first year alice was currenltly standing timidly in front of the wizengamot completing her induction into the actual profession and after your maternity leave you agree wholly to come back to work and join the war against you know who i do alice repeated eyes sparkling with a joy and a fierce determination then i pronounce you alice longbottom a fully fledged auror soon to be ready to join the ministry auror workforce thank you sir alice said quietly and she gratefully took her certification papers from an elderly looking witch at the door hurrying out and into the cool hallway of the ministry she was met by frank who happily took her in his arms and swung her around you re one of us now he asked grinning broadly she nodded i only hope it right she mused accepting the responsibility four years before i actually ready that why lily refused to join and james wasntoffered i sure we re making the right choice frank assured her with a kiss it times like these we must take desperate measures besides you ve got loads of extra training from order meetings and battles that true alice admitted and suddenly her face lit up with a smile i cantbelieve i an auror at last you ll make a brilliant one too so will you alice said hugging her husband come on let head to the office and start today a little eager frank asked laughing handsomely alice just smiled in return she wanted to do as much in the war as she could before she had to go on her maternity leave when they reached the office they were mostly assigned to simple and dull paperwork filing the latest death eater sightings recording voldemort most recent assaults organizing the names of the victims most of them deceased it was depressing work and alice could only think of her irritance that she was made to start at such an easy job her complaints were soon put to an end though when mad eye moody the head auror hurried towards them he explained that there had been a surprise attack on a small muggle family nearby where calli and cadence lived he said that the building had gone up in flames and death eaters might still be lingering around the scene of the crime you want us to go alice asked meekly instantly regretting her previous desires to do something more dangerous mad eye nodded and then barked yes now hurry and join the other assigned aurors remember constant vigiliance alice hurried forwards alongside frank wondering what dangers they were to face next 00000 meanwhile cadence stood by a burning building anxously peering through it gaps and windows in hopes of spotting her friend a long gash ran down her side from where the single death eater had attacked her undoubtedly he like cadence and callidora had heard the screams and doubled back to finish off his victims cadence had tried to stop him she really had but he had had the element of surprise and managed to get in a vicious cutting spell directed at her before disappearing into the smoking doorway cadence wiped away a tear of fright as she prayed for her friend saftey she had tried following the evil wizard into the house to stop him but bleeding and injured she had not been quick enough to beat the flames which had seized the oppurtunity and completely blockaded her only entry even the water spell wasntstrong enough to put it out oh come on calli cadence muttered pacing anxiously not only was the fire a risk enough but to be trapped inside with a deadly death eater anixiety overtaking her she hurried around the house still keeping her eyes trained on the house for any sign of life as she reached the back of the blazing cottage her eyes focused on an empty window cadence was sent sprawling across the grass with relflexes like lightly she was back on her feet wand trained on a small boy no older then three he stared at her in astonishment and fear it took a startled moment to realize that an adult woman lay unconcious beside him is this your mommy she asked gently leaning down and wiping soot from the boy nose he nodded round eyes taking in the frightening scene of his house burning behind her but cadence had more important things on her mind she quickly surveyed the back of the house and saw where a window had been opened did a woman help you out again the boy nodded mutely and cadence felt a pang of worry where was calli is she had succesfully rescued these muggles sissy still im sibe the young boy offered in a scared voice pointing a tiny finger at the house sissy cadence repeated in confusion suddenly comprehension caught her you re sister still inside she asked quickly the boy yet again nodded what to do what do i do cadence wondered as she started to panic suddenly the glass in the windows shattered from the pressure of the heat sending glass shards flying cadence dove down and covered both the boy and his mothers face in protection calli she screamed every ounce of desperation flowing into those words as fear took over her senses a faint sound of footprints reached her ears whirling around weakly she found herself staring into the concerned and frightened eyes of alice longbottom a n i just found out that my teacher post poned a due date for one of my school projects so i got to update sooner then i intended it a little rushed

rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 29 bitter betrayal callidora blearily opened one eye only to be blinded by searing white light gasping she wondered where she was and what had happened to her cautiously she re attempted to open her eyes managing this small feat she gazed around at her surroundings she lay in a stiff bed covered with snow white sheets the room she was in was exceptionally boring and the floor was smade up of linoleum sighing she rested her head in an equally stiff pillow as realization kicked in she was in a hospital room impatiently calli waited praying someone would come in soon and answer her questions what happened to me who got me out of the house is cadence alright did the mother and boy make it safely away from the building was the girl miss prewett exclaimed an elderly witch in delight as she entered the jumped having been so preoccupied with her thoughts that she had not heard footsteps approaching where cadence calli blurted the first thing that came to her mind she had so many questions that she was having trouble picking just one to start with cadence the healer repeated as she bustled around the bed checking that everything was in order i dont know about her but there a few people waiting to visit you perhaps she is among them when can i see them callidora asked nodding anxiously right away dear but there no need for them to come here you re quite okay we just wanted to keep you until you awakened the healer explained not seeming to notice the urgency in her patient voice i not hurt callidora repeated dumbly nope dearie just a little smoke inhalation which we fixed up when the aurors borught you here callidora sat in silence for a moment revelling in the news that she was uninjured oh okay then er thanks and bye calli finally managed to say the healer nodded briefly and calli pulled herself out of the hospital bed she gasped in pain as she got to her feet her limbs felt incredibly weak while her muscles ached as though every one of them had been sprained resisting the urge to sink back into the fluffy white blankets calli forced her feet to move and exited into the hallway following the directions on signs she made her way to the main lobby callidora cadence squealed the moment calli entered the room callidora managed a weak smile before being engulfed in her friend wide embrace over cadence shoulder calli noticed lily hovering nervously near james her face was pale and her mouth taut with worry nearby stood the rest of the marauders as well as alice and frank hi everyone calli said quietly once cadence had released her the men just nodded but lily and alice hurried forward to hug their friend are you okay lily asked sounding slightly strained yeah just really sore she replied wincing as alice patted her arm lightly we were so worried alice blurted callidora gave a shaky laugh i can tell you all look as though someone died cadence gave a small smile well you could have this statement reawakened something in calli mind what happened to the family she asked urgently alice and cadence immediatly bowed their heads and lily wrung her hands nervously sirius answered for them the boy and mother are fine but the girl and father er well they didntmake it out callidora momentarily blanked as the image of the fiery roof beam toppling to the ground no she groaned i tried i could ve saved her she wasnteven an arm length away lily soothingly put her hand on calli shoulder you couldnthave saved her calli or she would here now you did everything you could and that all you should focus on lily explained sympathetically the others nodded their support wait cadence how did you find me calli asked letting her friends soothing words comfort her briefly cadence shook her head i didn t alice came to your rescue she showed up soon after you helped the muggles outside i was with my new auror squad alice offered callidora pondered this for a moment oh how come your an official auror now and lily isn t just wondering the ministry is in desperate need of more aurors lily explained answering for alice and seeing as i resigned before they could promote me alice got the job i dontreally mind though i want to put all my efforts into suddenly james clapped a hand over lily mouth there was a brief moment of silent confusion er i want to put all my efforts into the order lily said struggling to cover up her almost slip i see remus said surveying her and james closely his light blue eyes seemed to comprehend what no one else was well anyways we should get home it getting late and tonight been rough already peter said sounding almost nervous and no more running into burning buildings sirius warned cadence seriously before kissing her goodnight everyone bade their goodbyes and soon dissapparated it really had been a frightening night 00000 okay i dontknow if any of you have guessed already but there something we want to share with you alice explained a broad grin on her face as her eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation it was friday evening and everyone was at the potter place everyone that is to say remus sirius peter cadence callidora the longbottoms and of course the hosts lily and james everyone nodded expectantly not knowing what to expect they had all made predictions earlier when the longbottoms and potters were out of the room but none of them were really realistic cadence had said she though that both couples were announcing their divorce but then remus reminded her that that was hardly what they d call exciting calli was sure it had to do with the order of the phoenix which she knew little about while sirius guessed that they were purchasing some new fancy wizarding item remus had suggested lightly that maybe they were expecting a child but his idea was quickly laughed off and scorned lily and alice being pregnant at the same time they thought you ve got to be kidding besides as callidora pointed out lily wouldntbe willing to have a child at such a young age our news is lily said her voice quivering slightly with a mixture of nervousness and delgiht alice and i are pregnant dead silence filled the room as though it were the aftermath of a bomb sirius was the first one to react other then remus who had a knowing smile spread across his face oy mate why didntyou tell me sirius shouted joyfully jumping up and embracing james in a one armed hug james just laughed while sirius turned to lily picked her up and swung her around he accidentally knocked peter over in the process oh merlin lily congragulations and alice you too calli squealed with sheer happiness you re going to be a moms lily and alice merely smiled as numerous congragulations buzzed around them only peter seemed to be less then pleased with the news after being knocked over by a twirling lily feet he seemed dazed and with little memory of the previous events in fact he looked positively ill as he sat still on the chesterfield having been momentarily knocked out he could only recall brief moments from the time before our news is pregnant oy mate lily and sirius faces swam in his mind as he struggled to recall what had happened now it came swirling back to him lily must be pregnant he didntrecall about alice being so as well a look of pure horror and realization spread across his face the celebration continued late into the night sirius opened a bottle of firewhisky and offered it around alice and lily of course didnthave any though being as it was alcohal peter soon announced he wasntfeeling well and left his absence wasntmissed however as conversation ran wild from the discussing of baby names to who would be the godparents padfoot of course james announced cheerfully after checking with lily she smiled at sirius expression he looked as though he d never been happier before in his life alice and frank desicion however was based a little more on family well my mom always lamenting on how she d like the chance to raise another boy so i think we ll have to give the honours of godmother to her frank explained alice looked pleased with this desicion as well and no one objected they were all so overwhelemed with joy it was near three in the morning when the guests began leaving remus left first mumbling something about having to work the next day following him were callidora the longbottoms and finally cadence and sirius congragulations again cadence whispered as she hugged lily in farewell thanks lily whispered back and watched merrily as her and sirius dissaparated 00000 my lord i have urgent news for you a cloaked figure whispered nervously as he kissed the hem of a taller wizards robes lord voldemort stared down coldly upon his servant what is it wormtail he demanded scarlett eyes peering downwards the prophecy snape speaks of i have found the child peter said hurriedly lord voldemort eyes immediatly flicked with interest you have found the child impossible he cannot be born yet well no peter admitted but before he could finish explaining voldemort foot collided with his stomach rolling about a foot away he lay spluttering and gasping for air then why do you bother me with these lies voldemort hissed impatiently m my lord peter gasped the child is not born yet but the one to bear him next summer is l lily potter voldemort froze in his tracks as he contemplated this finally his face broke into an evil smile well well we will have to drop in on her baby shower after the birth then wontwe y yes my lord peter replied stumbling to his feet voldemort laughed cruelly and then said to wormtail you have your masters gratitude however i will have to punish you for your lack of getting straight to the point crucio horrible pained yells filled the cool night air a bitter screechy song of a friends betrayal a n i am so sorry everyone i haventbeen able to access my word

darkness james remus sirius and peter stepped out of the carriage they had been riding in running a hand through his hair to make it even more messy then it had been before james gazed around fondly can you believe this is our last year here guys he asked aw dontgo all soft on us prongs sirius protested i not i just mean that this is our last year to play pranks and all james replied slightly haughtily remus grinned i know what you mean james gave him a thankful look going soft i tell you james muttered as the marauders made their way into the castle and to the great hall 000 lily seated herself gracefully between callidora and a fellow gryffindor girl named marlene and serena took seats opposite to them hello lily marlene said pleasently hello she responded politely but with a hint of distraction in her voice slightly worried she glanced searchingly up and down the long table hoping to spot one of her best friends whom she hadntseen on the hogwart express alice jones was perhaps lily very best friend indeed they had been friends from the very first time they had set foot on platform nine and three quarters alice was probably the quietest and more reserved memebr of lily group of friends rather then dating every other boy in hogwarts as cadence tended to do she had comitted herself to a single deep relationship with a man named frank who had just left hogwarts the year previous unable to spot her friend cheerful and rather round shaped face or honey brown locks of hair lily inquired hey did anyone see alice on the train it not like her to be late calli shrugged and serena said didntshe owl you guys she sent me a letter saying her mother had fallen ill and she wouldntbe arriving until tomorrow morning lily stared at her how come you didnttell us earlier i thought she d tell you serena defended herself look calli cut in calmly if her mother is sick she was probably too busy to owl all of us lily nodded in worried agreement did she say it was serious cadence asked frowning no her letter was brief there wasntanything else serena responded quietly it doesntsound good lily opened her mouth to speak but was cut off by professor mcgonagall announcing the sorting lily sighed poor alice dinner was a solemn event during which professor dumbledore gave a grim speech on lord voldemort and what his return might mean i must warn you all to excercise extreme caution this year he had said the girls exchanged dark looks lily was surprised to see that even the marauders were looking serious about the subject wonders never cease she thought gravely before long however the students were dismissed and everyone groggily made their way up to the gryffindor dormitories upon arriving lily made straight to head for bed but james grabbed her arm what she snapped stifling a huge yawn we have to do our rounds he reminded her quietly lily eyes widened with surprise and a light blush spread across her cheeks potter was supposed to be the irresponsible one er thanks she mumbled biting back her annoyance james smiled no problem how about i do the west wing and you do the east that fine lily replied casting an appraising look over james what with you she asked brusquely for a moment james looked surprised but shaking it off he responded i ve grown up he said simply the corners of lily mouth twitched as though she were going to smile but she hastily surpressed it well good maybe i will make it through this year alive then she joked gravely more to herself then anything grinning despite what she had said james turned and left the common room lily followed a moment later 000 lily awoke early the next morning to the sound of rustling clothes and parchment good morning lily alice said in an unconvincingly cheerful voice alice lily responded groggily as she opened her eyes we missed you last night yeah i had to come late my mother fell really ill i sorry i didntowl you but i was really busy alice replied letting her voice trail off sadly what the matter lily asked her eyes squinting against the morning light which was boring through the windows frowing with with concern she quickly sat up and surveyed her friend alice eyes were slightly puffy and red and her face was set in a grim expression i ll tell you and the others later i want to finish unpacking before classes start alice said clearly trying to buy time to ready herself for an explanation lily nodded in understanding of course lily and alice shared a dorm with cadence marlene and another muggle born girl named june rylander 000 oi prongs wake up sirius shouted in the early hours of morning james stirred sleepily and rubbed his eyes do i have to he complained sirius looked at him incredulously we have to set the prank up peter gave an excited little whoop causing sirius to roll his eyes right said james a raucous smile spreading across his face he leapt out of bed eagerly and proceeded to get dressed just because he was deflating his ego didntmean he couldntstill get into mischief he just had to make sure lily didntknow it was him sure you re up for this moony he asked happily remus looked at him tiredly the full moon was approaching i suppose we d better not get caught though we won t sirius said confidently remus shook his head doubtfully but his eyes twinkled with mild mischief once they were ready and james had his invisibility cloak and the marauder map they left the gryffindor dormitories and made their way down to the kitchen sirius and james were squeezed under the cloak as remus and peter got into less trouble so they would be more unlikely to get punished severely checking the map at regular intervals they made it to their destination without their presence being detected ready sirius asked gleefully as he turned to look at james james nodded and whipped off the cloak remus reached out and tickled a pear which dwelt in the painting of large and colourful fruit bowl the pear squirmed for a moment and then transformed into a magnificent door handle the marauders hastily entered the kitchen what can we do for you sirs a house elf asked squeakily upon spotting them grinning wickedly sirius looked expectantly at peter er i was w wondering if you would s serve me one hundred cups of t tea he spluttered nervously the house elf widened it already superbly large eyes in surprise yes sir odd though your request is we shall do as you wish moony go with him make sure he keeps them distracted james ordered quietly with a reluctant nod remus swept off after peter james then turned to sirius and winked let go hurriedly the two boys approached one of the long tables which were identical to the ones above in the great hall this table happened to correspond with the slytherin table already on the golden dishes and platters were biscuits bacon eggs sausages and more james and sirius immediatly jumped into action bewitching the food with different charms and hexes they had discovered that very summer once they were sure they had left no dish uncharmed they hurried back to main cooking area done james whispered breathlessly in answer to remus quizzical look er guys sorry about the tea but we really have to go sirius said the house elfs stopped in their scramble to make tea pardon a particularly small one squeaked in as it stopped filling the fiftieth some cup with hot water we have to go james repeated and without waiting for an answer they left the bewildered and slighlty irritated house elves behind 0000 lily calli cadence serena and alice sat down in the great hall for breakfast stifling a huge yawn cadence immediatly began dishing food on to their individual plates so alice what up calli asked sighing alice turned to look at them well my father died she said bluntly lily covered her mouth in horror while the other girls looked equally shocked what happened serena asked in a hushed voice slightly teary eyed alice responded quietly he was an auror and well you know who deatheaters killed him alice i so sorry lily choked fighting to hold back her own tears as she had spent a few christmas at the jones so that why your mother was sick calli said sympathetically as alice nodded tears spilling gently down her cheeks lily reached over and hugged her and soon found the others joining in the girls were so busy trying to comfort alice that they didnteven notice the strange noises coming from the slytherin table thanks you guys alice said attempting to smile as she whiped her eyes on her robes the others nodded reasurringly lily ate the rest of her breakfast in silence how many people are going to suffer at the hands of voldemort and his deatheaters she wondered sadly a n sorry about this chapter i know it a bit arubpt and jumpy but i just wanted to set the character personalities a bit better hopefully the next chapter will be better anyways please review if you have a moment i ll update as soon as possible before it began by

that formed this fanfic chapter 30 mist before the storm callidora peered anxiously at her reflection in the restaurant window she was in diagon alley about to enter a fancy wizarding restaurant to meet kenneth for her date all around her shoppers jostled past dragging small witch and wizard children with them or either lugging heavy bags of potion ingredients quills and other assorted knick knacks taking a deep breath after rearranging her hair for the millionth time that evening calli approached the door and stepped into mermaid palace it didnttake her long to locate kenneth he was sitting at a small table near the entrance looking eager for her arrival once he saw her he immediatly jumped to his feet and hurried towards her for a moment there i was worried you wouldntshow he said smiling tentatively as he took her arm kindly and led her to her seat callidora laughed politely i d never dream of showing you up i only late because of my roomate cadence she tried another cooking spell and ended up blowing our living room up kenneth chuckled in amusement the evening seemed to pass quickly with both parties enjoying themselves enormously after dinner kenneth led calli to a magical courtyard behind the restaurant where music was playing and couples danced with each other dreamily shall we kenneth asked romantically as he offered her his arm calli smile broadened magnificantly of course all in all callidora felt as though she d never met someone as sweet as kenneth they both felt a connection deep and strong even though it was only their second date calli will you be my girlfriend kenneth whispered softly into her ear as they danced closely to a slow song by a famous wizarding group calli felt her heart melting as she replied with a gentle yes hardly able to contain her glee calli kissed kenneth passionately and warmly tingles shot up her spine as he returned the gesture and embraced her tighter then ever before she had never experianced a night so perfect 00000 remus sirius and james sat excitedly in the quidditch stands as they watched puddlemere united face off against the wimbourne wasps peter had once again failed to join them as he mysteriously became sick for what seemed to be the tenth time that week and lily and cadence were at the potter place having a girls night with alice nevertheless the three marauders were enjoying themselves greatly as they re immersed themselves in the old sport the look of longing on james face as he watched the quidditch players whoosh by on their brooms was apparant to even the dullest of creatures it seemed so long ago that he himself had felt the wind rush through his hair as he flew felt his hands snatch the quaffle from mid air felt his muscles move harmoniously as he threw the quaffle through the hoop and lead his team to numerous victories sirius could sympathesize with him having been a beater himself go wasps remus cheered as the wimbourne wasp seeker esmeralda jones dived in pursuit of the snitch no no no sirius screamed james shot his best mate a questioning glance since when did sirius root for puddlemere united i just dontwant moony to in the bet he explained his voice hoarse from so much shouting james rolled his eyes before adding his cheers to the pandemonium he himself preferred the wasps over puddlemere that was a great game remus exclaimed as minutes later they exited the stadium a broad grin glued to his face esmeralda jones had managed to catch the snitch thus ending the game and resulting in a 290 260 wimbourne win this victory had also cost sirius five galleons from having bet with remus on the game bloody brilliant james agreed heartily sirius mumbled and kicked a nearby garbage can unfortunately the hem of his robes caught on it dragging him to the ground as it toppled over from his previous kick roaring with laughter remus and james waited as sirius grumpily used his wand to fix his cloak and staggered back to his feet they were just getting set to apparate when a sly quiet voice caught their attention as a pale blonde haired man walked swiftly past them lucius malfoy james hissed malevolently the marauders had never liked the malfoys as they were always so obnoxious and prejudist james in particular harboured a strong hate for the twisted family as lucius had always treated lily with such contempt not to mention the potters had a long history with the malfoys from the very beginning the two pure blood families had been rivals the malfoy views about muggleborns and half bloods were well known and the potter efforts against this prejudism were equally as well noted the marauders exchanged a mischievious glance should we remus asked worriedly oh stop being such a prat moony sirius scoffed you got the cloak with you prongs james nodded deviously as he subtly removed it from his robe pocket remus hesitated for a moment before muttering fine let just get this over with 00000 oh lily alice gushed happily it looks perfect lily smiled as her alice and cadence all stood back in the small bedroom to admire their work in the future baby room i canttell you girls how thankful i am lily exclaimed dontworry we know we re great cadence joked with a teasing grin alice laughed lightly thanks for helping me with mine too i still cantbelieve we re going to have our babies around the same time lily it pretty amazing she agreed serenely cadence put on a fake pout stop it you re making me feel left out she said sarcastically alice and lily rolled their eyes simutaneously if you want a baby so bad why dontyou and sirius discuss it alice suggested innocently i dontknow we re not even married cadence replied thoughtfully i guess we re just not at that stage yet you two after all were always the responsible ones maybe we re just not mature enough yet i wouldntexactly call james the most mature person in the world lily scoffed i wouldnteither but you have to admit he come a long way from the arrogant ego maniac he used to be cadence reasoned fair enough alice stated i guess but anyways cadence dontworry you should take as much time in your relationship with sirius as you need lily replied i agree alice added cadence smiled gratefully at her friend support thanks guys i needed to hear that i really do love him i just feel we need more time to let ourselves mature 00000 padfoot you re on my foot james grumbled as the three men huddled under the invisbility cloak as they hid behind a large rubbish bin in a dimly lit alley shh remus hissed nervously they could just barely make out the soft conversation going on between lucius malfoy and another person whose identity was unbeknowest to them you shall not disobey orders that filthy mudblood is not to be touched until the babe is born and as for this news of the pregnancy of mrs longbottom we shall have to see we have not instructions as of yet and we wouldntwant to mess things up lucius dangerously sly voice commanded james felt his blood run cold what did he want with alice and could the muggleborn they spoke of so rudely be lily she was afterall with child but he did not see how anyone else would know about it yet perhaps it was just coincidence stop fidgeting remus ordered in a quiet tone of alarm as lucius dissapparated with a loud pop sirius stopped scratching his arm and froze as the man that had been with lucius swept out of the alley his long black robe dragging behind him james craned his neck to get a glimpse of his face but remus forced him roughly back what in the name of merlin do you think you re doing he asked sternly his face pale with alarm without having said anything james was able to deduct that moony too had been alarmed by the dangerous reference sorry james said lowly slowly he removed the invisibility cloak and tucked it back into his pocket sirius surveyed his two friends warily that didntsound like i thought it did did it i afraid so remus said gravely however james you musntjump to conclusions we ll inform dumbledore but i believe we should keep this from the girls as you heard whatever those dimwits are planning isntgoing to take place for a long while and you wouldntwant to worry lily overly if as we assume it her they are referring to if so her and alice will be safe until dumbledore figures what this is all about afterall unless they were deatheaters they dontpose any real threat anyways well that a very real possibility isntit james muttered in frustration sirius and remus shot him a sympathetic look fine james agreed reluctantly but we go now to inform dumbledore sounds like a plan to me mate sirius stated agreeably with a quick nod between the three of them they dissapparated leaving only a thin eerie mist in the alley similiarly though james had no way of knowing this what he had heard tonight was only the mist before the rising storm of danger ahead of him and his friends author note okay so i understand there a huge chance of you all hunting me down and killing me for not having updated so long but before you do let me at least apologize i so sorry to have left you all hanging back in december the last few months have been an extremely busy time

you all in reviews soon and i promise for real that the next free moment i have i will update this story thanks again and i truly am sorry for the excruciatingly long wait before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 31 the echoes of thunder the night engulfed the small deserted street a light breeze rustled the dead leaves in the yards of the houses and overhead the stars twinkled faintly all was silent except for the occasional hooting of an owl and the distant rushing of cars on the nearby highway nothing seemed to be amiss as alice longbottom astutely surveyed the houses lining each side of the road where she now stood everything appeared to be perfectly normally it was just another night for the muggles around her nothing to be wary or fearful of i cantsee anything that seems odd a hushed baritone voice informed her mildly startled alice jerked her head around to find her husband frank longbottom approaching her are you sure she asked uncertainly reed said this was the place only a half hour earlier had the auror superintendent wayne reed warned them about a planned muggle killing the area she and frank had been assigned to the field work while two other aurors had been sent to investigate the source of the threat however as she stood here now in the tranquil silence she felt sure reed must have misinterpreted the tip off i really dontknow alice maybe we ought to head back to the ministry frank suggested almost as if on cue a bright flash of sparks came from the opposite end of the street there she exclaimed in a tremorous voice immediatly she and frank took off at a run towards the source drawing her wand alice shouted lumos a beam of light erupted from the tip of her wand and alice used it to see her way in the blinding darkness remember if there more then one we call for backup frank reminded his wife she nodded distractly and brushed her gold brown locks out of her eyes breathless the two of them arrived at the very end house yard the door was conspicuously open with scorch marks across it front clearly a wizard or witch had been here and alice would bet her life savings that it was a death eater no mark in the sky yet frank noted they canthave killed them already well let hurry then we re wasting precious time alice said gritting her teeth as she worked up her courage right then let do this frank said with that he stook several long strides to the door holding his wand aloft alice hovered anxiously behind him ready to attack should a spell go his way peeking a cautious head into the doorway frank carefully observed the living room and attatched kitchen for any signs of danger nothing seemed out of place but the soft murmur of voices from the upstairs floor gave away their enemies position silencio alice thought aiming her wand at her feet immediatly the soft patter of her footsteps died as she walked across the hardwood floor of the main level frank did the same as they reached the staircase no matter what happens frank began in a barely audible whisper but alice interupted him with a kiss i know for a moment the two shared a smile despite their doubts they wouldnthave been sent on a mission for it was perilous due to alice pregnancy but as they had been the only fully qualified aurors in at the time the ministry had not had any other options it was a regrettable choice but one that had been necessary the longbottom only preoccupation now was to successfully carry out their task and keep safe reaching the top of the landing frank gave alice hand a quick squeeze then let go and moved forwards ahead of them a door remained open just a crack golden light poured out from the crack along with the voices w w w ho are y you a man frail voice inquired a cruel female voice responded we are everything you cannot even begin to fathom i i i dontu unders stand the victim continued tripping over words in his fright the deatheater laughed again her voice was oddly harsh and mocking prepare yourself for death another voice asked this one was rough and deep a male s their seemed to only be two death eaters alice shot frank an inquiring look and he nodded fierce determination in his eyes go he mouthed lunging forwards in unison alice and frank slammed the door open their wands pointed directly at the throats of the two death eaters to her astonishment they were the only living people in the room on the floor lay a murdered wife and husband but werentthey just talking to them alice wondered in bewilderment suddenly comprehension kicked in such pathetic you aurors are the woman sneered alice scowled she recognized that voice from the duel at the ministry ages ago it belonged to bellatrix black you re going to pay for what you ve done tonight frank said threateningly the death eaters again broke into hysterical laughter alice felt a churning sensation in her stomach shouldntthey be the least bit apprehensive so you fell for our little lure did you the man asked alice clenched her teeth and frank tightened his grasp on his wand so that his knuckles turned white their child had been at risk because of this ambush but how could the ministry misread the threat so wrongy alice wondered angrily but then a second wave of understanding hit her her eyes widened with disbelief reed she questioned her voice soft and losing vitality by the minute clever girl bellatrix crooned too bad brains wontsave you now what frank scorned angrily you actually think you two would be a match for us the death eater eyes narrowed dangerously behind their masks watch what your mouth you scum the man warned fighting back a torrent of rage alice straigtened her arm she had had enough stupefy she screamed wand aiming directly at bellatrix before the jet of red light had even gotten halfway towards it target it evaporated in midair what frank exclaimed as he emitted a gasp neither death eather had so much as raised their wand you re right longbottom came an eerie high pitched voice they probably wouldntbe a match for you as pathetically dim witted as they are master bellatrix began to protest but the figure immerging from the shadows by the closet raised a hand to silence her alice felt her blood turn cold voldemort frank hissed his face an expression of mixed contempt and fear like his followers he too wore a long black cloak and mask the only difference was the searing red eyes peering out from behind the mask alice felt a shiver go up her spine at the very sight indeed now i believe we have been fortunate tonight you two belong to the order of the phoenix it wasnta question bellatrix and her comrades must have obviously noticed them the last time they fought trembling uncontrollably alice wondered if they knew about the pregnancy i have suffered your presence long enough voldement declared when neither alice nor frank made an answer crucio frank collapsed to the floor writhing with pain with a small wail alice dropped to her knees next to him experimillimus bellatrix shouted adding her voice to the din of screaming with a feeling of hopelessness alice watched with tears in her eyes as her wand was sent flying she wsa going to die she and frank were going to die their child would never know life that thought relentlessly plagued her mind and then suddenly she knew no more pain everything went black 000 lily lay in bed curled next to james as the rain pounded heavily on the windows outside lightning flashed and thunder shook the house despite the storm formidable nature lily had always been enamoured by such occurences in her mind it was a breathtaking event straight from the heavens as a child she had lain awake all night just to watch the streaking bolts of electricity criss cross against the black sky and when they had occured during the day she would halt whatever she had been doing to take a few moments to watch in awe lily smiled as watching out the window she witnessed another bright streak cut across the sky with incredible brilliance within second a deafening roar of thunder shook the house james jolted awake from the noise the storm was right above them now w whas goin on james asked through a wide yawn lily merely nodded her head in the direction of the window as yet another blue line of lightening creased the sky james eyes widened as he put his glasses on wow brutal storm he commented marvelling at the sheer power the storm possessed i think it rather peaceful lily mused not taking her vivid green eyes away from the window james raised a curious eyebrow are you insane it possible lily replied sarcastically well there no possible way i going to be able to sleep through this james informed her i getting up and i the crazy one lily asked in incredulity you always were was not lily scoffed i seem to remember a certain someone parading around in his third year while all the teachers discovered they had woken up to blue hair that wasntme james protested lily gave him a skeptical glance with which james replied to relucantly it was sirius honest lily continued staring ok i might ve sortof helped out just a teeny little bit point made lily told him stretching her arms she sighed i guess i getting up too then knew you d agree with me in the end james announced with childish triumph lily rolled her eyes whatever without further arguement she slipped out from under the covers and changed into a comfortable sweater and jeans she then proceeded downstairs where she quickly boiled some water with magic and made tea james joined her shortly at the kitchen table where they continued to drink in silence as the booming thunder continued to vex the night the clock on the wall read five thirty five am when lily finally spoke up are you scared she asked james was baffled what are you scared lily repeated looking directly into his eyes james blinked awkwardly er of what lily sighed in exasperation having a child james she commented as though it were obvious taken aback james pondered the answer no actually he finally concluded lily tilted her head slightly really how come james shrugged non chalantly he was determined to keep his mouth closed about what he and the marauders had overheard a week ago they had consulted dumbledore on the issue and found him to be worried but confident of their saftey james trusted his ex headmaster if he wasntbothered then james wasnteither i dunno i guess i ve just been too excited i ve waited for this all my life he answered honestly what there to be afraid of oh james you can be so daft lily told him with another sigh there are so many things that go wrong we re in the order we re aurors in training what if i lost you what if we were attacked and we lost the baby covering her face with anxiety lily rested her forehead against the table lily shh everything will be fine i promise trust me okay james said comfortingly wrapping lily in his strong arms she leaned against his chest and kissed him softly on the cheek okay it just oh i dontknow i already in love with this child james and it would kill me to lose him ecspecially when we live in such a dangerous time i d never let anything happen to you james whispered i know a sudden clattering on the window caught their attention it an owl james commented in surprise getting up he strode over to the window and undid the latch the barn owl quickly slipped inside dripping water all over the counter hurrying over lily watched with interest as james removed the water sodden envelope and opened it up the parchment was damp but fortunately the ink hadntbegun to run what it say lily asked in puzzlement james brow furrowed as he read a short but informative line immediate fear gripped at his heart quick we have to leave he told lily grab your coat what why she asked becoming uneasy at james manner there been an accident i ll explain when we get there just hurry he replied feeling extremely troubled lily hurriedly fetched her coat and met james back in the kitchen st mungo s he informed her let go just as another round of thunder went off shaking the china in the cupboards lily and james apparated leaving the parchment to flutter slowly to the countertop on it inscribed in hasty black writing were the words mr and mrs potter we would be deeply appreciative if you could report to st mungo hospital immediatly there has been an issue regarding the aurors frank and alice longbottom please do not panic but come straight away your cooperation is appreciated rena mccaffery hospital suprevisor for a final time lightning illuminated the empty house it was an ominous sign in the darkness as the minutes passed by steadily the rain began to fade away and the grey clouds parted revealing the stars overhead the thunder become an almost inaudible echo in the distance grass shone in the moonlight as it beared fresh dew drops and the leaves of the trees glimmered brightly under the moisture the storm had passed leaving life behind it author note well for those who haventread my author page i hadntplanned to update this story for a while but here we are i guess the mood just sortof struck me anyhow i do apologize for

novel now still though i haventforgotten about all you awesome reviewers i will continue this story i just ask your patience in doing so thanks and please feel free to leave comments complaints praise or critism before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 32 fleeting seasons apparating directly into the hospital lobby lily took a moment to catch her breath james appeared beside her with a soft pop as he materialised out of thin air both of them hurried to the welcome witch desk hardly aware of the sick wizards and witches around them can you tell us two aurors should just have we got a letter lily gasped in her panic beginning several different sentences yet not completing them alice and frank longbottom the black haired witch asked with a sympathetic smile they re in the emergency ward on the spell damage floor thank you james replied taking lily by the shoulders and guiding her towards the stairs as they reached the marble staircase they both hastened into a jog what in merlin name happened lily practically wailed you dontthink i dontknow lily let not assume the worst though james told her firmly supressing his fear was taking up all his concentration and already he was numb with disbelief alice was no longer supposed to be doing field work for the aurors nor was she to be doing missions for the order surely it could not be a random attack disturbing thoughts of the various possibilites plagued james mind until they reached the fourth floor upon arriving at the landing both he and lily froze it was time to face their fears and find out what had happened to their friends mr and mrs potter came an inquiring voice still panting and out of breath both he and lily turned to find a curly brown haired witch with a clipboard in hand gazing at them she was dressed in robes of white with traditional emblem on the front he nodded hastily and the witch extended her hand to him and then lily in turn rena mccaffery i afraid i have grave news for you regarding the longbottoms i ve summoned you here because of your relations to the two and the fact that you are ex coworkers am i correct yes lily said her voice taut with nervousness rena bowed her head good i hoping then you can help us sort this mess out wontyou please step into my office alright james replied he grabbed lily hand and they both followed the hospital surprevisor into a small but cosy office he hoped this witch would hurry eager as he was to find out what had happened to the longbottoms he was more concerned with their present state of being now as i understand things rena began once they were all seated mrs longbottom applied for auror office work and a soon to come into effect maternity leave correct both lily and james nodded mutely then would you have any idea why they might be ordered to investigate a recent death eater threat when dozens of other aurors could have taken the call i dontknow lily said quietly despite her panicky fear she felt an anger rising within her it was indeed odd that alice had been sent out on the field not to mention very irresponsible of the ministry do you know who issued the command rena mumbled i ll check and began shuffling through the parchment on her clipboard eyes darting back and forth as she scanned the report lily and james waited in tense silence wayne reed deputy head auror she finally said lily raised an eyebrow in thought have you tried contacting him she finally asked when she came to no conclusions rena expression turned grim well that just the thing he seems to have fled james swore under his breath both he and lily exchanged a glance the imperious curse james stated gravely i ll bet you anything this was volde rena made an odd hissing noise at jame words sorry james said brusquely i mean you know who work impossible rena commented in disbelief still looking quite pale at the very thought i afraid it highly likely lily said her own voice quivering with fear but anyhow what happened exactly are they alright the longbottom are alive rena assured them though her voice was not one of confidence our top healers are attempting to revive them as we speak she inclined her head from what we gather the two of them went out to investigate as they had been ordered too when the other aurors finally arrived on scene they found the death mark over the dwelling alice and frank were both unconcious and along with their still bodies was that of a muggle couple and a single death eater the latter three were dead lily gasped and covered her mouth it no doubt you are shocked the longbottom certainly put up a fight once they are recovered i expect their will be a service recognizing their efforts the death eater is believed to have been one of you know who top men rena said with a somewhat fierce approval in her eyes lily and james remained mute with shock anyhow we do thank you for your assitance we just wanted to confirm everything the longbottom should be coming around now if you d like to visit them before you leave rena said a tone of finality in her voice as she got to her feet thank you lily replied quietly as james gave the witch a small nod the three of them exited the office and as lily and james turned to head down the corridor to the wards rena headed towards the stairs they re in the greg julion ward she called and then disappeared down the steps how awful lily commented as she and james made their way to the intended ward poor alice and frank she looked rather on the verge of tears james patted her softly on the back i know love but at least they survived they re fine now and that all that matters he assured her lily sighed see this is exactly what could happen james it terrible one moment we could living in perfect happiness and the next lying in a hospital bed lily exclaimed slightly bitterly i wontlet anything happen to you lily james said soothingly she gazed up at him her green eyes sparkling with tears i know but i worry about you too unable to think of a respose to this james pointed at a sign on the hallway we re here he stated simply lily hurried to the small window on the door and peered inside a single healer was making notes on a clipboard but otherwise everything seemed to be quite alright knocking with a still shaking hand lily waited as the wizard hurried to open the door for them visiting hours are over he said shortly your suprevisor gave us permission i an auror in training and this is my wife james explained the healer eyed them warily alright but make it quick once they were in the healer stepped out i ll be back in five to check on them you d better be finished by then he warned then and hurried off lily felt a stab of irritance at his words alice and frank were both sleeping in their hospital cots chests rising and falling steadily as the only sign they were alive both were quite pale and frank had a long gash running the length of his cheek lily tentatively pulled up a chair inbetween their beds while james took to standing beside her almost as if sensing their presence alice eyes flickered open lily she asked hoarsely lily nodded and rested a hand on her friend arm alice smiled as at the same moment tears flooded in her eyes and streamed down her cheeks we got one a death eater i mean she said a mixture of pride and regret in her voice lily forced a smile on her face we know you did good but i just glad you re okay it was him lily alice continued as though she hadntheard her friend words it was you know who he tricked us lured us into the room by pretending the muggle were still alive james grimaced at the very thought of voldemort trap as alice spoke every word seemed to be costing her great effort bellatrix black was there you know that slytherin from when we were at school she was dating rodolphus lestrange then she was there but she didntget us he you know who did did the cruciactus curse on frank i blacked out alice continued with great difficulty i came to quickly only to find that you know who and black had fled but frank was duelling the other death eater i managed to send a curse his way once i had retrieved my wand mine riccocheted and hit frank the death eater rebounded back upon himself i dontknow what curse he used but it finished him not the avade kedavra lily asked in a hushed voice alice shook her head couldnthave been that one unblockable anyhow the aurors barged in shortly after i reckon that why you know who fled dumbledore was with them he sent us here oh alice lily exclaimed you have to give up work for now with that close call and all alice smiled weakly i know still as terrible as tonight was we managed to contribute that death eater luren i think it was well his loss is a big achievement reed too i dontknow if you heard but apparently it was all a trap to get us killed he was a double agent you know who must have discovered we were part of the orde shh lily and james hissed at the same time glancing around warily lily made sure there was nothing conspicuous sorry alice whispered lily made to reply but at that moment the arrogant healer from earlier re entered the room time up he informed them alright lily said reluctantly as she got to her feet take care okay and tell frank we stopped by we ll come back to visit you thanks lily and you too james alice said wearily lily shot her friend one last reassuring smile before exiting the room i hope we never have to go through that again lily sighed to james as the stood for a moment in the corridor too many close calls i hate voldemort i know love most people do james replied he wrapped his arms around her shoulders and for a moment they just stood there finding comfort in each other presence i suppose we should go lily finally whispered it been a long night yes it has james agreed solemnly let go with two louds cracks both apparated leaving the hospital corridor deserted and eeriely quiet each moment of silence seemed to echo with the question how much more would the world have to suffer in voldemort wake 000 as the season passed and the bright autumn leaves gave way to snow things seemed to quiet down regarding voldemort terrible tyranny indeed ever since the longbottom had been released from the hospital the order of the phoenix nor the auror department had had much to do almost immediatly aftter alice and frank left st mungo they became much admired figures in the wizarding world stories and rumours spread like wildfire about how the couple had faced voldemort three times and survived not to mention killed off a major follower however alice longbottom had much more to think about then her recent fame both she and lily were now experiancing the full onset of their progressing pregnancy as the winter became colder lily found herself on christmas morning studying her figure in the mirror her small hands rested delicately upon the slight bulge under her green sweater she smiled as she thought that next winter it would not just be her and james celebrating with their friends and still the seasons continued to progress as both lily stomach and her love grew before long the month of may was upon them bringing with it the warming sunshine and the realization that their was only three more months until the baby due date a recent trip to st mungo revealed that the the baby would be born somewhere around august fifth alice was to be born aroung the tenth of august lily and james along with the continuous interference from cadence and sirius had decided that if the child was a girl the name would be adriel and if it was a boy harry lily had loved that name since she herself was a young girl thankfully james had liked it as well all seemed perfect in wait for their child in complete joy of expecting james almost seemed to have become a different person the same could be said for sirius both men were rarely seen without broad smiles on their faces these days and neither would give lily a moment peace indeed sirius was so adament about making sure lily was safe he had begun making several daily trips to godric hollow and the potter house lily had not quite decided whether she found this more annoying or amusing yet meanwhile james had gone crazy with spending he had already purchased a stroller crib blankets and dozens of neutral infant clothes frank was behaving similiarly both alice and lily shared many a laugh that spring while they too were excited both found it in their best interest to take things at a much slower pace in the wake of all the excitement and happiness it seemed for a while as though voldemort and his followers had ceased to exist while the order assured them that he was merely regrouping and concocting new plans it was hard not to lose themselves in the momentary bliss this is indeed why it came as such an unpleasurable surprise to be called to an urgent order meeting during mid may sitting between sirius and james at headquarters lily listened with dismay as dumbledore filled them out on the latest events they ve threatened to attack a small wizarding community just south of somerset unless we release the the five death eaters we caught back last fall he explained calmly though his blue eyes were fiery with anger proposterous one elderly wizard exclaimed vehemently dumbledore raised a silencing hand indeed the ministry of course is not prepared to let that happen and they ve already sent out several aurors to combat i however am worried that his may be a ruse to lure security away from the ministry i want a few of you to head there now just in case and also just to remain cautious we should have some of you head to somerset as backup voldemort everyone flinched and a few witches yelped remains as unpredictable as he has always been dumbledore finished fixing them all with his light yet serious gaze immediatly several people stood up and volunteered james got to his feet hesitantly and while lily did not protest she felt her stomach lurch uncomfortably sirius remus peter and frank also rose alice covered her face with her hands in stressed anguish excellent you five he gestured to the marauders and frank and you too alastor should head out for the ministry immediatly the rest of you he waved a hand at the other standing volunteers should head out to somerset with me lily alice would you two be willing to remain here and act as communicators so we can know what is happening at either end dumbledore asked as he finished issueing orders alice and lily both nodded resolutely of course alice said softly right then we best be going good luck everyone dumbledore said with a grateful nod at the two woman be careful lily said quickly giving james an anxious kiss on the cheek he rested a hand on her cheek i will as alice too finished her farewell to frank she and lily both watched grimly as the rest of the order filed out either using the door and preparing to apparate and using the fire to floo their way to the ministry i hate not being able to help out lily said bitterly once everyone had gone alice nodded still at least we get to do something we re communicators remember yes well still anyways i suppose we might as well do something while we wait lily said gesturing to the large accumulation of rubbish and parchment on the table with an audible sigh alice withdrew her wand i hate chores alice grumbled as both women began clearing the mess author note well here you have it chapter 32 summer is here which means i will have more time to write to add to this i seem to have my inspiration back

summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 33 eyes of a demon alice and lily waited tensely at the long table in front of the fireplace fifteen minutes had already passed since the others had departed and not a single patronus had been sent to them yet to indicate where the death eaters were attacking though this was probably good news lily couldntstop the barrage of unpleasent thoughts assaulting her mind she prayed that james and the others were safe she couldntgo on without them on the opposite end of the table alice looked equally as distracted with her wand held loosely in her hand she repeatedly flicked it causing a lone quill on the table to do backflips her eyes however were unfocused and she looked deathly pale lily couldntblame her if it had been she who had been attacked last fall by lord voldemort and his supporters she probably wouldnthave gotten over it yet either as lily sat staring aimlessly at the dancing flames in the fireplace she felt a flutter of movement from within her as the baby kicked she smiled lightly and rested a hand over her stomach affectionately please james be careful be safe lily alice cried jumping to her feet unexpectedly snapping out of her reverie lily tore her gaze from the fire and saw a silvery stag shaped partonus appear in the sitting room everesco she muttered breathlessly performing the spell that would enable her to receive her husband message in a light toneless voice the message was relayed death eaters planning to attack headquarters lily and alice you must leave immediatly and come to the ministry it will be safer here we will warn dumbledore once you arrive hurry lily felt her heart beat speed up considerably the death eaters were going to attack headquarters impossible it would then be the second time their headquarters had been given away unless they really did have a spy in their midst one that even dumbledore had not detected yet shaking her head to clear her jumbled thoughts lily hurried over to the fireplace beside alice she was looking just as frightened we have to hurry they could arrive any minute alice said a note of hysteria clouding her voice lily nodded wordlessly and seized a handful of glittering green floo powder she tossed it into the grate just as a distant pop reached her ears someone had clearly just apprated outside the building hurry alice hissed the ministry of magic lily spoke clearly as she let the warm flames engulf her body it was fortunate that she and alice were still able to use the floo network the previous month the healers had informed her that apparation was only safe until the fifth month and floo was safe until a month before the baby was born thankfully she wasntalong already within seconds lily emmerged into the atrium from the fireplace shaking the ash off her emerald robes she glanced around for the others and felt her heart plummet nobody but she was in the hall accompanied only by the echoing silence she turned around planning to go back and warn alice but her friend had already arrived what the matter alice asked catching sight of the expression on lily face i dontknow where are the others she said in a determinedly steady voice alice face if possible seemed to grow whiter not another trap she asked fearfully lily shook her head let not assume the worst she instinctively rested a hand over her stomach thinking hard all the while they must be hear i ll bet you anything they re waiting for us on the auror floor or even at the minister office yeah that ll be it alice agreed uncertainly how about i head up to the office and you go and check the auror headquarters we ll meet back here if we dontfind them agreed agreed lily replied and if if something does go wrong send a patronus but then escape to saftey alright alice hesitated both friends realized how hard it would be to abandon each other if there was indeed something amiss alice lily said gently we have to think about what more important now she gestured mildly at her swelling stomach alice sighed i know anyways we d better hurry ecspecially if the others are waiting right lily said with determination let go then good luck without another word both woman hurried in opposite directions lily to the golden railed elevator lift at the end of the hall and alice to a flight of stairs catching her breath as she stepped into the lift and pressed the button which would take her to the auror floor lily took a moment to quiet her panicked thoughts everything would be alright she assured herself sensibly however as the elevator doors re opened lily couldnthelp but let her uneasiness surface at the conspicuous absence of other ministry workers was it a day off or was everyone having one big meeting someplace unless something really was the matter as she strode swiftly down the eeriely quiet hallway a sudden noise broke the silence someone screamed and with sickening realization lily felt she recognized the voice with every fibre of her being screaming in fear lily sped up her instincts keeping her quiet heart thudding she arrived at the door to the auror office before something clicked in her memory feeling quite discomfited lily lifted her wand and gave it a wave expecto patronum she whispered watching as her ghost like cat emmerged from her wand tip quickly she focused on her message in her mind and then beckoned the phantom creature to go with a last feeling of overwhelming fear lily watched as the cat disappeared around the corner in it search for alice then she turned around and faced the door seizing hold of her remaining gryffindor courage lily put her hand on the doorknob and turned it preparing herself to enter the room she had just heard the scream come from 000 apparating directly into the atrium of the ministry james looked around while waiting for his friends to arrive with five loud cracks that resounded throughout the empty corridor remus sirius peter frank and mad eye moody appearied next to him moody grimaced and growled immediatly as he surveyed the lack of people in the hall better notify dumbledore something definitely up that wontbe necessary came a cool voice before anyone could take any action feeling his stomach lurch james spun around to face the newcomer directly ahead of them stood six death eaters all adorned with the usual black cloaks and eerie masks heart constricting with anger james raised his wand is it true one of them spoke with an oddly raspy voice that could be recognized as female that the pathetic auror traitor longbottom expects a child with his wife frank eyes narrowed dangerously with fury it none of your business he snapped fighting back the rush of panic he felt at their words they wouldntharm alice he thought anxiously they just wouldn t quite the contrary actually longbottom said the first death eater his grey eyes gleamed under his hood but nevermind that you dolts have once again found out about our plans i d say it a pleasure but we re rather in a hurry tonight so we ll just kill you quickly he said snidely as he finished the other death eaters obediently raised their wands and prepared to fire the order however was too quick muttering a curse under his breath mad eye gave his wand a complicated wave causing a great jet of silvery light to pelt towards their opponents the death eaters scattered in panic and the order used the distraction to their advantage run we ve got to get them seperated james bellowed as he dodged a stunning curse that had been sent his way the others heeded his words and immediatly shot off in different directions james streaked towards the stairs and threw himself down them focusing solely on remaining on his feet expelliarmus shrieked a man voice from the top of the stairs james glanced behind him and made to dodge the spell but it was too late the jet of light hit him squarely in the chest sending him flying down the remaining stairs while his wand flew to the left and landed metres away as his head cleared he dimly registered that they were on the auror floor with a cry of triumph the death eater reached james wand pointed threateningly at where his heart would be grey eyes glinting maliciously under his hood james recognized the death eater to be the one that was in charge i ve got one the death eater shouted up the stairs kill the others and proceed with the mission you ve got to find the minister no doubt he hidden himself after sending the other home i ll take care of this traitor a few shouts came in reply to the grey eyed one orders james made one last desperate attempt at reaching his wand flinging himself across the hardwood floor he just managed to get his fingers around it eh the death eater cried in alarm as he realized what his lapse in attention had caused him not wasting a second james sent a violent curse his way and the death eater only just managed to block it a large gash tore open the side of his robes nonetheless making a harsh whipping motion the death eater countered but james was ready leaping to his feet he got out of the way and replied with yet another curse parrying the spell with quick wit and skill the death eater continued to battle engaging himself and james in a full fledged duel panting for breath james used every ounce of cunning he possessed to try and defeat the death eater he had to warn lily and dumbledore imperio the death eater cried harshly james made to dodge the spell but stumbled on a piece of rubble from the wall that was the result of a misguided hex he blanked as the curse hit him and before he knew it a pleasent buzzing seemed to fill his ears it was as though he had not a care in the world any more every worry fear anxiety he may have had disappeared relaxing in the wonderful grip of this ethereal purgatory james felt as though a voice was whispering in his ear use the patronus charm send for the others of the order then we shall have some fun send a patronus tell them to come to the ministry losing all sense of what was happening james obliged thinking it to be a very fine idea indeed it was only as his silver stag patronus incidentally the same form he took as an animagus that reality came crashing back down blinking in confusion james cast a glance at the death eater who appeared to be grinning in delight james felt a sudden sense of forbidding as comprehension came to him at last no he exclaimed furiously throwing himself at the death eater forgetting all reason as he let his wand clatter to the floor you foul you you swears streamed from james mouth as he landed his fists on every inch of the death eater he could reach as he took a particularly ferocious swipe at the man face a loud crack signalled the breaking of the man nose in rage and pain the death eater kicked out catching james in the stomach he doubled over in agony and tried desperately to catch his breath the death eater took the moment to get to his feet blood pouring from under his mask crucio he hissed angrily and james was overcome with unbearable pain nothing else compared he wanted to die for the death eater to kill him now then an image of lily surfaced in his mind and he gripped tightly to it almost immediatly the curse was lifted and the death eater let out a roar of fury what magic is this he questioned incensed james made no movement no attempt to escape or to fight back he sensed that another presence was with them now raising his head weakly afraid of what he would see he glanced up through his cracked glasses into the eyes of a demon burning red pitiless eyes lord voldemort laughed and all at once james felt fear like he had never known before author note hope you enjoyed please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what

characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 34 i dontwant to lose you crucio voldemort said his cold voice alit with malice james couldntmuffle the scream that escaped him as pain beyond pain engulfed him minutes passed minutes he could not recall in his agony and he soon found himself face down on the wooden floor his body ached and his head was throbbing why did they stop daring a glance up james saw both voldemort and the death eater staring at the opposite side of the room voldemort was grinning almost maniacally in his eyes were pure glee frightened of what he might see james forced his neck to turn and as he saw the object of the dark lord attention he felt his heart plummet lily stood in the doorway like a startled deer her viridian eyes were wide with shock and her mouth agape with horror as james gazed at her frightened expression he couldnthelp but let a wave of utmost helplessness wash over him everything he loved everything he lived for was lily and the soon to be baby excellent voldemort said his voice eager with anticipation you fools who love are so easy to lure hurt and trap lily did not dare move as the evil wizard spoke but her grip tightened on her wand james staggered to his feet with difficulty neither voldemort or the death eater made a move to stop him both looked exceptionally pleased with the situation even moreso then was normal let her go james said between his clenched teeth panting hard and still bleeding from the scrap on the stairs he waited for voldemort response it came in the form of a high pitched laugh of mirth when i have such luck double luck i may add he sneered no you two have fled like cowards long enough tonight i finish this your child will never know life james felt a fury grip him an unfamiliar emotion except the brief pangs he had experianced during his days of torturing snape he refused to let them harm lily james came a small voice positively quivering with fear lily looked positively faint as she continued to maintain her postition in the doorway despite her fear something glittered in her eyes determination lily run james said firmly raising his wand preparing to do everything in his power to block voldemort path to her the death eater made to move forwads but voldemort raised a pale hand to halt his actions let us see what he does he spoke in a clearly amused tone james glanced at lily who had refused to move he felt a prickle of impatience quickly stifled but more intense fear lily go he shouted his slightly panicked voice echoing across the spacious room no she replied striding forwards she pointed her wand forwards and took aim i not going to leave you but the baby james muttered weakly as she came to stand by his side she shook her head resolutely and swore at voldemort james clearly had no other choice but that didntmean he couldntprotect her to the best of his ability cruci voldemort began to say but a bright blue jet of light from lily wand shot right at his head and he broke off his spell in order to concentrate on avoiding it his head out of the way the curse slammed into a desk behind them and evaporated into dust lily look furious a fierce determination gleaming in her eyes now she didnthave emotion to spare for fear with a slashing movement the death eater and now came at james just as voldemort went for lily though he would have preferred it the other way around james could not afford to dwell on the issue as he fired curse after curse upon the death eater narrowly dodging a vicious cutting hex james bellowed sectumsempra the death eater was too slow to block it after having wasted time witht he wand movement required for the previous slashing hex immediatly long gashes split his robes and blood spurted from his torso he went down with a pained scream and a triumphant james hurried to where voldemort and his wife were duelly so fiercly neither seemed to be making any headway wand moving so fast it was a blur lily barely managed to duck voldemort last curse before james went barrelling into him though it was not one of his brighter ideas it did give james a feeling of satisfaction to hear the crack of skull on stone as voldemort head bashed into the wall james shrieked lily her pretty face terrified as voldemort recovered in barely half a second without a word voldemort whipped his wand and james spun around so that his back would recieve the blow immediately pain exploded down his spine and bright white dots appeared in his vision as he collapsed face first onto the cool wooden floor he heard the light tinkle of glass as his glasses shattered above him he heard voldemort cruel laughter again and lily frantic sobs a desire to keep fighting despite being near unconciousness or even death swept over him and once more he attempted to struggle to his feet he was saved of this most pain staking endeavour however when a familiar voice rang across the room hope gave new life to him as james saw the dim outline of sirius black remus lupin frank longbottom and albus dumbledore charging across the wreckage which was the auror office oi sirius bellowed followed by a more crude statement james was dimly aware as his old headmaster brushed past him long robes billowing as he took over the duel with voldemort within seconds he felt lily hand in his as sirius and remus helped him get to his feet lily james said hoarsely collapsing into her arms she hugged him with her teary eyes why did you send the patronus she asked her voice still wavering remus and sirius both looked at james curiously their eyes occasionally darting warily to where dumbledore and frank were trying to subdue voldemort i didn t james stuttered weakly i m mean i did but i was under the imperius curse lily opened her mouth to reply but a deafening crashing noise brought all their attention back to the present dumbledore had been sent flying to the floor and frank into a desk as voldemort apparated both lay relatively still for a moment before regaining their footing lily james dumbledore muttered hurrying over to them are you all right lily shrugged but james was too weak to answer dumbledore studied him keenly for a moment before taking out his wand and beckoning for him to lie down i can fix this he said gently he murmured something under his breath and the tip of his wand glowed orange dumbledore then proceeded to run it over the length of his back while the other watched with bated breath it was as though waking up from a bad dream james concious became clearer and clearer as each wound was healed and before long he felt completely normal except for the occasional minor aches and pains reparo remus muttered instantly repairing james glasses thanks he said gratefully as he stood up again lily cast him a worried glance but did not speak we had better leave dumbledore said with a sigh the minister will be down here shortly and you d be better off at home resting then attempting to explain this but what about the other death eaters james asked we ve got them all mate sirius said clapping him on the back james winced mad eye and the others are keeping watch over them now but why was no one else at the ministry lily asked in mild confusion workers i mean gone home dumbledore answered with another weary sigh someone tipped off the minister that the death eaters might be planning to attack the ministry and so he evacuated the place then he took to hiding in his office he seemed to think it would be more safe then his own home and i have to say he quite right the enchantments guarding his office are much stronger though i sure they would not have held had voldemort taken to breaking through it but how did you know to come lily asked i mean alice and i came here because of the patronus alice ran into us remus explained gesturing to himself sirius and frank we were losing the fight against the death eaters but she had the sense to go back and send a patronus to dumbledore and the others so it was all just a ruse to get into the ministry then james clarified indeed it was dumbledore agreed the death eaters do not know the location of the headquarters of the order of the phoenix nor were they planning to attack somerset it would seem i was correct in my suspiscions so that it then he failed lily mused sounding slightly skeptical dumbledore smiled at her thanks to you alice james and the others had you not fought so hard against voldemort he may have had time to move on and lily james frank i am sorry that you had to be caught up in this i know it isntquite the appropriate time to be duelling death eaters frank and james nodded wordlessly right lily said quietly a moment silence followed this until frank finally broke it shall we head home then frank asked uncertainly dumbledore bowed his head certainly and i shall make sure you are not called on again for missions tonight was a closer call then i would wish to admit he said gravely take care lily said softly as she and the others prepared to apparate without speaking they somehow all intuitively agreed to apparate to the same place seconds later she james sirius remus and frank were standing in the living room of the longbottom place alice and peter were already there waiting anxiously accompanied by cadence and callidora as well as callidora boyfriend kenneth hi lily said with a faint smile cadence and calli shrieked with apparant relief and threw their arms around her neck oh lily cadence wailed are you alright callidora asked eyes wide with worry she then rounded on james and you is everything okay james nodded wearily and sank into the sofa lily joined him a moment later and before long everyone had taken to sitting what happened cadence asked breathlessly alice told us some but she said well cadence glanced hopefully at the others seeking their support with some reluctance lily james and sirius told the main parts of the story occasionally assisted by remus frank and alice and he just disapparated kenneth asked in wonder as they finished the retelling lily nodded he must have been overwhelmed what with dumbledore and us lot yeah alice mused silence fell upon the group as each considered their own thoughts callidora sat in kenneth arms as he absent mindedly played with her hair cadence and sirius were sitting side by side cadence eyes following the dancing flames in the fireplace while sirius had his head rested on his hands remus and peter sat quietly staring into nothingness alice had her head rested on frank shoulder nobody seemed to know what to say we d better go home james said after a long while the others nodded mutely everyone seemed to be still shocked about the night events and what could have happened lily quickly hugged her friends in farewell before apparating with james back to her own home 000 at home both lily and james prepared for bed still not speaking it wasntuntil they were both lying in bed that james spoke why didntyou listen to me he asked in a peculiarly high sounding voice lily frowned and rolled over so that she could face him he was however staring at the opposite wall i wasntgoing to abandon you she replied a slight edge in her voice you wouldnthave been abandoning me james said firmly you d have been getting to saftey james lily exclaimed in exasperation he would have killed you dontbe selfish james snapped finally turning to face her his hazel eyes glinted with frustration you have more to consider here then just what you want lily was at a loss for words wha but james pressed on what about the baby would you have risked everything it was two lives for one lily and you know it james wh but again james cut her off i care too much about you and the baby doesntit matter what i think doesntit he said his voice getting louder and louder but this time lily cut him off shut up she roared leaping to her feet you dontknow what the hell you re talking about donti james asked testily also getting to his feet that was just plain selfish how dare you call me selfish lily shrieked her famed temper flaring who had to deal with you running off everywhere on those dumb missions while i wait bearing your child not knowing if i ll ever see you alive again who has to worry that she could be left widowed with a child that might never know his father i dontwant to lose you james both she and james paused here breathing heavily and they glared at each other lily eyes immediatly filled with tears but she did not apologize i sorry james finally said i didn t i don t it just i know lily said her voice quieting down i worried too though james moved around the bed to hug her she swept her bangs out of her face and twisted so that she was looking directly into his eyes promise me you ll never leave me i promise james murmured still holding her with all the love in the world author note it would seem that i on a roll that three chapters in less then a week for me these last few chapters have just been so surprisingly easy to write they

and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 35 reappearences as the warm may sunshine gave way to the more intense heatwaves of june voldemort and his supporters seemed to grow more and more active while dumbledore was true to his word and did not request the potters or the longbottoms to partake in any dangerous missions lily couldnthelp but wonder whether they werentat just as much risk while not doing anything becoming more and more protective as the weeks went by james took it upon himself to apply several new security charms and spells on their household before no one had been able to apparate directly inside the house but now they could no longer apparate anywhere on the property he had also applied a series of intruder alert charms which would go off the second anyone set foot in or out of the house early one thursday morning while james was at work lily found herself startled out of a novel she was reading by one of these such alarms with a sigh she got to her feet and performed the spell that would enable her to determine who the arriving person was to her immense relief it was only cadence and callidora bringing with them alice hey lily greeted her friends as she opened the door to let them in lily you shouldntjust open the door to anyone cadence exclaimed a slight disapproving note in her voice what if we were death eaters under the influence of polyjuice potion lily raised an eyebrow at her friends as she allowed them to enter the house the intruder charms james put on the property require a spell to shut them off and show who the intruders are it not affected by polyjuice potion so i d know your identity anyways she explained patiently oh cadence said clever indeed so what brings you all here today then lily mused with a smile callidora returned the grin and said airily well we haventbeen able to do too much together lately with you and alice being so far along and all the recent death eater activity so we figured we could make it a girl day out they arrived at my house at six this morning alice said feigning grumpiness frank nearly blasted them into next week he was so startled by their early call cantsay i was overly impressed either cadence grinned not abashed in the least lily couldnthelp but laugh well it sounds fine to me what did you girls have in mind the insane asylum alice said promptly jerking her head towards cadence and calli lily laughed again as cadence gave alice a reproachful look we were actually thinking of diagon alley probably safest there callidora explained calmly though still grinning slightly brilliant lily replied shall we set off immediatly then let s the others agreed in unison lily quickly collected a few galleons and sickles and stuffed them into the pocket of her black robes then as she and the others exited she turned and quickly activated all the security spells frank been like that too alice said gesturing to the house seems to think having a baby in the house will attract you know who even more yeah james is pretty paranoid lily agreed ignoring the slight chill that went up her spine at alice words still though we cantcomplain overly true enough alice said simply hurry up you two cadence called from where she stood on the road leading to godric hollow she and callidora were already waiting ahead of them lily shook her head slightly and hastened her steps moments later the foursome had apparated to the leaky cauldron the barman hardly flinched as they appeared in the midst of the pub but looked up hopefully lily shot him an apologetic smile as they exited the smoky room and stepped into the sunny courtyard outside of it callidora quickly used her wand to tap the bricks in their assigned order then stepped back as the wall opened up to diagon alley i haventbeen here in ages lily commented glancing at all the shops reminiscently branched out a bit hasntit oh yes callidora said as she led the way down the busy street there are loads of new shops and restaurants in fact the one we re going to just opened the previous week you d think business would have slowed down some considering all the news alice said thoughtfully i reckon everyone rushing into things because of it though cadence said in reply i mean look at the rubbish that popped up too and she gestured towards a series of booths set outside ollivander wand shop with a keener glance lily saw that they seemed to be selling protective potions dark spell deflecters lily read outloud as they passed a kiosk selling defensive amulets yep they dontwork though cadence said shooting the saleswitch a dirty look just trying to make a quick knut we re here callidora said straightening her blue robes crusset cuisine with curious expressions the others followed her into the restaurant there was a very warm and friendly atmosphere about the place everything seemed to be decked in blue velvet from the curtains to the chairs seats surrounding the tables this is nice alice commented casting an appraising eye around the place lily didnthave a chance to agree for at that moment a witch approached them table for four she asked peering at them with her dark brown eyes she had curly blonde hair and two inch nails painted turquoise yes cadence answered following the witch as she beckoned them towards a booth lily settled herself next to callidora while cadence and alice sat opposite to them my name is loreen and i ll be your server today can i get you anything to drink the witch inquired politely yes thanks a gillywater callidora replied butterbeer cadence chimed in happily gillywater lily added alice hesitated before saying and i ll have the same as her right then loreen said summoning a series of menus with her wand as she scribbled down their orders with a quill be back in a moment she bustled off winding through the other occupied tables so how re you feeling callidora asked when no one else spoke up her question was directed towards alice and lily fine they both replied at the same time exhausted though i ll be glad when the baby born alice added callidora smiled gently kenneth wants to start a family she said somewhat dreamily i think we might get married this fall that great calli lily exclaimed feeling a burst of happiness for her friend bit soon isntit cadence asked not really i mean and calli blushed here we re in love and all so well i happy for you alice said with a broad grin thanks callidora replied what about you and sirius cadence alice inquired you two have been together since well forever about three years cadence corrected her and what about us well dontyou want to get married or something alice asked slightly awkwardly cadence shrugged non chalantly we re actually pretty content i mean we know we re in love we see no reason to tie the knot just yet maybe after you know who is defeated she said understandable callidora commented just as loreen arrived back with their drinks she quickly handed them out and then took their orders for their meals beforing disappearing again before long their food arrived and the girls tucked in eagerly the food was delicious and lily felt content their wasntmuch conversation until they had all finished eating and cadence spoke up so we know that in the light of recent things lily and alice haventhad the chance for a proper babyshower lily and alice exchanged curiously surprised glances and so callidora continued we thought we d have a small celebration of our own you shouldnthave alice admonished lightly but there was no real conviction in her voice callidora and cadence summoned two brightly wrapped packages each with their wands here you go lily and here alice cadence said handing them each a package as did callidora hurry and open them she added eagerly as she and calli sat back to watch smiling slightly lily gently removed the lilac wrapping from around her gift she gasped as an exceptionally soft material fell into her lap holding it up so she could see it in all she saw it to be a beautifully designed baby blanket with a pattern of the night sky on it due to it magical nature the stars twinkled and comet streaked gently across the threads thanks calli she exclaimed breathlessly dontmention it callidora said happily now lily turned to the package from cadence tearing the bright red paper off of it she found inside a medium sized box it a toy cadence blurted unable to contain her excitement any longer lily laughed as she opened the box and found twenty four blocks flashing different colours thanks cady lily smiled appreciatively yeah thanks you two alice added looking slightly teary eyed both calli and cadence nodded looking quite pleased with themselves well i suppose we d best be off cadence said getting to her feet i ll just go pay the bill oh here lily said fishing in her pockets for some coins but cadence shook her head firmly it on me consider it a gift from sirius and she grinned mischieviously revealing a handful of galleons that had certainly not come from her vault lily rolled her eyes but made no protests stubborn as she was cadence was known for her persistance after cadence had found and paid loreen the girls exited the charming restaurant and decided to hit some stores before heading home they stopped at madam malkin where alice and lily watched gloomily as cadence and callidora tried on various robes and cloaks oh dontlook so pouty callidora said lightly as she studied herself in the mirror modelling a satin grey cloak there a maternity section over there lily wrinkled her nose while alice flatly refused as if i need to be reminded that i the size of an elephant alice said dryly well it only temporary cadence reminded her exasperatedly still i perfectly content with what i already have she retorted after thoroughly picking through the entire store the four of them continued on their way up the street callidora stopped at a quidditch supply store to replenish her stock of broom polish and alice dragged them into a stationary shop for new quills before long hours had passed and evening was upon them i should pick up some stuff for supper lily mentioned cadence scanned the street i dunno if you can lily everything closing lily groaned i really dontwant to be stuck with just stew tonight she complained hmm maybe we can just stop in the muggle grocery store on the other side of the leaky cauldron what a grocery store callidora asked curiously while alice gave her a similiarly questioning look lily sighed it where they sell food you three can wait in the pub for me if you d prefer alright but dontyou think you re going to attract unwanted attention cadence replied being a half blood she understood fairly well you cantjust march in there wearing your witches robes oh right lily mused glancing down at her attire well then here she pulled it over her head so that she was only wearing jeans and an oversized t shirt then passed her robes to cadence see you in a minute then she said and dashed up the street and back to the brick wall tapping in the pattern she hurried through the gateway through the pub and out into the muggle street for a moment she stood there in bewilderment trying to recall where the shop was located it had been awhile since she had been in muggle company oh right she muttered finally locating it she quickly made her way through the crowd and to the shop eager to be out of there quickly she hurriedly collected the supplies she needed and went to stand in line at the checkout lily came a curious voice laced with disdain lily spun around in surprise and jumped standing behind her was petunia evans lily mentally smacked herself petunia dursley she corrected and what was more she was pregnant as well p petunia lily stuttered in shock both sisters were silent for a moment as they stared at each other blankly lily was the first to break the silence er um congragulations she said feebly petunia nodded you too she said stiffly lily eyed her sister interestedly and was not surprised to see that hardly a thing had changed her sister still had wispy blonde hair pale eyes and an unnaturally long neck she would have been as thin as ever as well had it not been for her bulging stomach her look of disgust also signalled that her feelings towards lily remained unchanged as well er how ve you been lily asked akwardly taking another brave stab at conversation petunia eyes narrowed shrewdly fine she did not return the question right lily murmured placing her purchases on the check out so the clerk could bag them lily then swore she had completely forgotten she would be needing muggle currency petunia gaze switched back from lily frustrated expression the expectant clerk and her gaze seemed to harden looking as though she d rather be giving her life savings to a monkey she took out the required amount and pushed it on the countertop lily felt like pinching herself to check if she was dreaming thanks she mumbled awkwardly collecting her bags petunia nodded again wordlessly and paid for her own groceries lily made to leave but then turned around as she reach the doors er petunia she called her sister gazed at her looking murderous that she dared address her so publicly will you tell me when when my nephew or niece is born fine petunia agreed sounding very unwilling thanks lily said softly and without a backwards glance she hurried outside not knowing that she would never again see her sister 000 later that night both james and lily sat curled together on the couch james was going through several reports he had to read for auror training and lily was supposed to be reading her novel however she couldnthelp but be distracted by thoughts of her earlier encounter petunia must care somewhere deep down because she helped me right i know she hates me but maybe family bonds can survive through that well no look at sirius family lily mind was swimming with all her thoughts and she couldntseem to order them lily james said sharply bringing her out of her reverie that the eighth time i ve called you he said more gently looking at her in some concern are you okay oh uh yeah lily replied mildly startled sorry i guess i just zoned out yeah james agreed anyways what up you ve been distracted since i got home just thinking about today with the girls lily replied evasively james didntseemed convinced did everything go alright he asked in concern yeah everything was great it just well i ran into petunia lily explained finally giving in under james keen gaze oh he said in some surprise his eyes then narrowed she didntgive you a hard time did she no lily replied well she wasntexactly friendly but she did help me out with money since i forgot about muggle currency right then james said yeah and she pregnant too lily added really james asked brightly then his tone faltered er is that good he asked meekly lily laughed at his sheepish expression well it not bad she mused i reckon she pretty far along further then me anyways oh well i guess we ll have a little niece or nephew then eh james said i suppose i doubt it ll do anything to mine and petunia relationship though she loathes me she wontwant a freak like me around her child lily explained a hint of sadness in her voice james muttered a very unkind word james lily reprimended though she looked mildly amused sorry lils he muttered smiling apologetically but it true he then added in an undertone luckily lily didntcatch it however the intruder charm had just gone off casting a high pitched whine into the air 000 after having gone back to lily and then alice houses callidora had headed back to her own flat cadence had gone to sirius to spend the night and so she and kenneth would have the place all to themselves he was very pleased to see her and the two of them wasted the evening away drinking firewhiskey and wine while sharing stories of their childhood and upbringing it was a conversation that never got old between the two of them callidora was a pureblood while kenneth was muggleborn and so they spent endless hours comparing the two lives as the clock struck midnight a loud knocking came from the door callidora looked up from the sink where she was washing some glasses with magic do you want me to get it kenneth asked kindly rising to his feet calli flashed him a smile no i ve got it it probably just cadence you can finish off the dishes though if you like she said he shrugged and took over by the sink brushing a soap bubble from her raven dark hair she hastened to get the door quickly she undid the locks and charms with her wand and opened the door the man standing there was enough to send her mind reeling in shock b briac she asked in bewilderment he laughed harshly his dark eyes piercing in the night callidora took in his appearence with relative unease his brown hair had grown out somewhat and it looked as though he hadntshaved in days he had dark shadows under his eyes and looked more menacing then ever callidora what a pleasure to see you again he rumbled his tone almost mocking calli felt a prickle of anger the last time she had seen this prick he had been cheating on her with another girl what do you want she asked brusquely keenly aware of kenneth listening from the kitchen arentyou going to invite me in briac asked slyly and without waiting for a response he pushed past her he stopped dead once he saw kenneth at the kitchen who re you he asked now sounding annoyed i her boyfriend kenneth replied his voice steely callidora edged warily towards the two she felt strangely uneasy briac lifted his wand as did kenneth callidora froze no don t she protested but neither man heeded her crucio briac bellowed in response to the furnunculus curse kenneth had just wielded briac curse hit kenneth sending him to the floor while the other spell merely bounced off of the oncoming jet of light and was sent riccocheting towards calli with a scream she dropped to the floor and covered her head the wall above her exploded and a large chunk of rubble collapsed onto her no she screamed ignoring the pain in her arm kenneth was writhing on the ground in agony stop it briac obliged but not before stunning kenneth callidora felt tears flood to her blue eyes what do you want she sobbed briac seized her roughly and pulled her to her feet he pushed back the sleeve of his cloak and revealed his left arm calli gasped spectacularly there burnt into the skin was the dark mark looking both sickening and eerie you re a smart girl prewett very unlike your cousins briac hissed addressing her by her last name what are you talking about callidora asked in alarm what have you done to gideon and fabion is molly okay you haven dead briac said simply a maniacal gleam in his dark eyes gideon and fabion were killed because of their resistance to the dark lord you d be best off not following their path what callidora asked fearfully deathly afraid of what he was telling her tears were pouring down her face now two of her cousins were dead and she was sure she would among them soon if only she could reach her wand which was lying on the floor from when she had ducked you re a pure blood callidora briac hissed menacingly and a very talented witch think of what use could be made of your skills under allegiance to the dark lord and you ve got very valuable connections too if you think i d ever join you scum then you re more of an idiot then i thought callidora exclaimed vehemently engulfed by her sudden fury and courage i dontthink it me that is the idiot here he snarled as he gave his wand a quick jab callidora wrenched away from him and dove towards her wand her fingers clasped around it and as she whirled around prepared to defend herself briac hit her a spell that sent a streak of purple flames across her chest immediatly she felt her conciousness fading and briac arm collect her slender figure as her world succumbed to darkness she couldnthelp but think of the afternoon she d had with her friends and as briac carried her swiftly out of the flat her bright blue eyes closed as her future plunged into the unknown author note so

alarm from ringing and find out the identity of the intruder kenneth he exclaimed in some surprise as he found out who it was ask the security question lily reminded him nervously just in case right james nodded the couple then waited several anxious seconds before a loud knocking sounded on the door kenneth is that you james called yeah came the muffled response lily heart jolted to hear the panic in his voice what is your lifelong ambition james asked reciting the security question from memory to have a succesful career in quidditch and then move to south america to teach at the wizarding school there he said hurriedly now open up it urgent james tapped the doorknob with his wand undoing all the charms and spells what the matter lily asked immediatly moving to stand beside james her eyes swam with worry as kenneth was revelaed to have a very dishevelled appearence what happened james asked sharply it calli kenneth panted a death eater he came crucioed me i think he took her a death eater lily asked dumbstruck kenneth only nodded contact the authorites lily james ordered moving to help kenneth to a seat did you hear who the death eater was brian no that wasntit briac yeah she called him briac kenneth affirmed james strained his memory why did that name sound so familiar lily chose the moment to hurry back into the sitting room she looked positively faint they ve dispatched aurors to the flat and there more coming here she informed the two men kenneth do you know who the death eater was some bloke named briac james said promptly before kenneth could answer lily eyes widened with horror briac she whispered completely dumbfounded kenneth nodded mutely distress apparant on his face oh merlin she muttered james that was the name of her ex boyfriend the one who attended durmstrang james clarified gravely realizing where he had heard the name before lily nodded soundlessly figures lils come sit on the couch you need to rest i ve got to alert dumbledore as to what happened good thinking she murmered collapsing on the couch she covered her face with her hands and felt the tears start no no no no how could this have happened for the third time that day the intruder jinx went off and lily slowly got to her feet to turn it off the auror are here james she called weakly after affirming who it was she opened the door wearily to two wizards and one witch frank longbottom was among them lily he said nodded his head and patting her arm lightly it ll be okay we ll find her lily tried to smile at his reassurances but failed dismally kenneth is over there she muttered gesturing the couch kenneth was already being interrogated by the witch we ll have to take him back to the ministry for further questioning frank explained as james reappeared by lily you ve informed dumbledore already he asked lowering his voice so they would not be overheard james nodded he already sent some of the order to check it out once the aurors have finished he really worried though he reported lily felt distraught why now she asked tearfully and she was a pureblood they had no reason to hurt her that might be exactly why they took her frank explained gravely she one of the few remaining purebloods you know who will want her on his side lily tried to ignore the despair welling up inside her anyhow we d better take him back to the office frank jerked his head at kenneth we ll contact you the moment we hear anything stay safe and i suggest you be the one to tell alice and the others will do james agreed come on lils and he led her back to the sofa they waited until the aurors and kenneth had filed out before resetting all the security charms i ll go put on some tea james offered lily who was staring into nothingness why dontyou alert the girls okay lily said softly quickly she conjured two individual patronuses and sent them off with a message for cadence and alice within minutes another one of the security alarms was going off but this time as a result of the floo network identity lily asked with her wand raised miss cadence summers mr sirius black mrs alice longbottom replied a montone voice from nowhere access granted lily said clearly the flames in the fireplace immediatly turned green as her friends came spiralling into the grate lily cadence wailed tears pouring down her face what happened they both embraced is calli okay alice asked her voice quiet with fear lily shook her head helplessly unable to contain her emotions any longer she broke down into a fresh set of tears we dontknow where she is lily explained as best she could through her sobs it was briac her old boyfriend he was a death eater and he kidnapped her no sirius said dumbstruck he cursed vehemently and stormed into the kitchen to find james lily couldntblame him callidora had been something like his second cousin twice removed or something what about dumbledore alice asked desperately her face also glazed with tears canthe do something he doesntknow a thing about why it happened or what they would want with her james answered startling them all briefly with his abrupt apperence he handed out cups of tea to everyone lily took one gratefully with her shaking hands the order and the aurors are looking into it poor calli alice said softly cadence sobs grew louder sirius walked over to her and put his arms comfortingly around her it ll be okay he said evidently trying to sound confident cadence didntseem convined for her crying didntcease james sighed and went to sit beside lily all we can do it wait he said resignedly lily leaned her head against his chest and closed her eyes sadly how much waiting would there be 000 albus dumbledore paced in his office light blue eyes unfocused as he recalled recent events just minutes ago he had recieved the disturbing news that a pureblood witch had been kidnapped by voldemort supporters gravely he realized it was just another event in a chain of recent misfortunes as he walked repeatedly past his desk his pensieve sat serenly upon it swirling with the ghosts of his thoughts it silvery colour matched it owner hair even as dumbledore ran a mental list of all the things he must do and have the order attempt he couldnthelp but keep his mind from what had happened the previous fall it had been a slightly chilly night when he had agreed to meet a witch who had applied for a job at a teaching post sibyll trewlawney although he was not much inclined to continue the subject of diviniation he had decided to meet her out of courtesy he had been surprised by her that night however when after a rather unsuccessful interview she had gone into a rather trance like state most intriguingly the woman had then proceeded to relay to him a prophecy and a most alarming one at that the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives even now as dumbledore paced in the serene silence of his office he could not help but hear those words echo around his mind repeatedly after trewlawney had made the prophecy he had made sure to immediatly hire her he had to be sure no one else would try to pry the memory from her mind even with these precautions though she had still been overheard partly anyways with grim resignation dumbledore sat down at his desk thinking of the spy that had been lurking outside the door though he did not know for certain that they were sided with voldemort he had his suspicions and his suspicions usually turned out correct even more bothersome had been the news james potter and the rest of his gang had brought him sometime previously in the year news that lily potter and alice longbottom were indeed with child and the death eaters knew dumbledore sighed and fawkes immediatly flew over and landed on his shoulder he patted the phoenix absent mindedly weighing his options there were three witches as far as he knew that were due to have a baby at the end of july or the beginning of office however only two of those sets of parents had escaped voldemort three times even with lethal information he could not do anything and this was what worried him the most he had no way of knowing just how much of the prophecy voldemort had gleaned and even then he had no way of telling what use voldemort would make of that information his only choice was to keep his spys in place and hope that they would be able to retrieve that valuable information until then he refused to bother the longbottom or potter with the worrying news they had enough on their mind with everything going on he would have thought them safer had the two families not found themselves at voldemort fury during that year it had been the third time each couple had escaped him thus setting the danger of the prophecy in stone fawkes crooned bringing dumbledore out of his heavy thoughts he sighed as he gazed at the bird in affection only with hope could he protect the chosen child even if hope was hard to come by in these dark times 000 the days following the attack on callidora passed slowly and rather uneventfully cadence had moved in with sirius for the time being and the aurors were questioning everyone who had known calli distressing as the investigations and lack of news was lily could not help but be slightly happy at the news that arrived at the end of june petunia had sent news albeit very brief and hostile that she had given birth to a healthy baby boy on the twenty third of june lily had privately laughed at the announcement of the child weight despite that fact that she would likely never come to know the child lily still felt a prickle of pride knowing that she was an aunt to the littlest dursley dudley the letter had said his name was james was somewhat less enthused but used the event to his advantage in means of cheering his wife up life had not been quite the same with callidora disappearence and lily really could not afford to go into depression so close to the birth of their child kenneth was not faring well at all since calli had been kidnapped alice and frank had invited him round for dinner a few times but it wasntlong until the man stopped doing anything at all he quit the quidditch team and when july first arrived with not a clue regarding the kidnap he left for south america leaving instructions for the aurors to contact him their if they found out anything cadence was still quite shaken by the event but her nature refused to succumb to it so lively as she had always been she quickly forced herself back into a usual routine including work with the hippogriffs and rather public snogging sessions with sirius he seemed rather glad to provide her with a suitable distraction from her worries and so as the summer moved onwards the rest of them continued with their lives the order and aurors were still looking but hope of finding her was steadily declining lily tried to assure herself that time was no factor in the odds but even she had to admit it didntseem likely they would ever see their friend again once again voldemort had taken life from their midst scarring them all and even as his reign made way for the ever oncoming darkness lily and james felt a talisman of hope glowing in their hearts and that talisman was due as july began fading away author note alright i know i implied that this would be the chapter of the birth s but there was too much information to cram in and i kindof want that chapter to be special like a whole chapter to itself you know so anyways i promise it will definitely be next chapter and that it will be up quickly in fact i am writing it right now so hold tight and please review i also apologize for the shortness of this chapter but i thought it necessary before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 37 the reason i breathe a gentle smile painted across her face lily stood back and eyed her and james handiwork fondly they had just completed putting the finishing touches on the baby room the hardwood floor had been freshly swept and a fresh coat of paint applied magically to the walls the colour they had chosen was a light yellow and lily had added baby blue stars to the wall charming them so that they glittered and moved against the far wall stood the holly wood crib james had made already it was filled with soft fleece blankets and a few stuffed animals a changing table and rocking chair among numerous other toys also had a place in the room even now there was a distinct aura of peace and tranquility about the room james ran a hand through his messy hair leaving it in even more of a disarray then before if that was possible lily couldnthelp but smile reminiscently at the action years ago that habit would have annoyed her to no end but now she couldnthelp but find it irresistible it ready james sighed oblivious to her staring he smiled slightly and rested his arm around her shoulders lily grinned up at him i know it hard to believe that there will be three of us in a few weeks she commented happily you re going to make a great mum you know that right james said and you ll make a great dad lily replied relaxing as she rested her head against his chest james kissed her cheeks and for a moment the two continued to beam at the room they had readied i guess we d better get ready for bed james commented off handedly it been a busy day lily shrugged fine by me you go on ahead though i just want to check on a few things first as james ambled off to bed lily slowly made her downstairs she felt impatience at her loss of swiftness but knew that she would be more then capable again in just a few weeks the end really did make the pregnancy symptoms seem worthwhile lily moved into the kitchen and pulled a calendar off the wall due to it magical nature the picture on top was animated and the dates flashed as it arrived on the current time she crossed off july twenty ninth with her quill and quickly examined the upcoming days july 30th no plans july 31st lunch with cadence and sirius august 1st healer appointment at flipping ahead lily took her quill and lovingly circled august fifth the due date of her baby she just couldntseem to shake the anticipation that had plagued her these last few days even as she joyfully thought of the weeks ahead of her she mentally reviewed all the things the healers had told and recommended to her apparating was no longer safe in the weeks upcoming to the birth nor was the floo network flying was strongly not recommended and she had also been warned against using major spells although minimal magic was permitted she thought she would crazy what with all james and sirius over protectiveness they would hardly let her raise her wand for a mere cleaning spell anymore insisting that they perform the magic instead alice however was having a much more difficult time of things lily having been raised in a muggle home was accustomed to doing things by hand while alice was not although frank did all he could to help her out there was still the fact that he had to work consequently cadence had been spending most of her recent days at the longbottom s nobody objected for it seemed to keep her mind efficiently off callidora disappearance shaking her mind clear of her busy thoughts lily tacked the calendar back to the cupboard and headed for the front door after liberally checking to make sure that all the security measures were in place she turned to go to bed as she crossed the landing at the top of the stairs she hesitated by the nursery a sense of contentment seemed to emanate from the room and lily knew it to be because of the sweet dream and happiness charms she had placed over the crib inside she thought she could feel the baby turn over and she smiled as she rested a hand over her largely bulging stomach soon she thought leaving her post by the nursery and heading to bed perhaps even sooner then she expected 000 the next morning found james cooking breakfast magically while lily read the daily prophet anything new james asked his voice mildly peculiar lily shook her head a few arrests on suspicion but dontworry nobody dead james was saved a reply by a sudden tapping on the window lily scowled as typically the security alarm went off cantwe just get rid of those damned things she muttered irritably unconsciously straightening a pile of scattered parchment and quills no love james replied patiently as he turned them off and hurried to let the owl in you know they re necessary lily merely muttered under her breath lily james exclaimed as he read the letter the owl had brought it alice she in the hospital lily heart leapt to her throat what she gasped unsure whether this was bad dontworry james assured her correctly interpreting her expression nothing bad the baby coming merlin lily exclaimed jumping to her feet we have to go to s the letter says that sirius is coming to escort us we can get ready though james explained lily eagerly complied excitement taking charge of her actions james too was excited and the two of them quickly got prepared here james said pressing a cloak upon lily she gave him a bewildered look which quickly morphed into one of pure annoyance james for merlin sake it the middle of summer the baby not going to freeze in thirty degree celsius weather she snapped james hesitated before reluctantly setting down the cloak luckily the security alarm sounded signaling their baby future godfather arrival ready mate morning lily feeling alright sirius said brightly greeting them warmly lily rolled her eyes perfectly fine thanks she muttered well let be off then james said taking a step towards the door lily patiently grabbed the hem of his robes and gave him a pointed look er yes he asked quizzically smell anything lily asked an eyebrow raised james sniffed the air wondering what she was annoyed about now he eyes widened as the smell of burnt eggs reached his noise swearing he hurried back to the kitchen to turn off the stove lily couldnthelp but smile and sirius laughed outright at his own friend lack of brain process ready to go now then james asked as he finally returned a smudge of soot on his nose without further delay the three of them locked up and strode down the driveway and to the road sirius threw his arm out wand in hand and with an earsplitting bang the knight bus appeared out of thin air a greeter immediately descended from the triple decker purple bus and launched into a long winded introduction yes yes lily said impatiently we know james helped her up the steps and then they all found a seat on the second level in less then a half hour after many hear stopping turns and perilous stops they finally arrived at the wizarding hospital what time did she go into labour sirius lily asked eagerly as the entered the hospital and marched through the lobby full of oddly ill wizards and witches i dunno frank owled remus at like four this morning and then he apparated over to see me a bit later so i reckon around three or so sirius mused lily nodded did the healers say everything okay it a bit early it not that early lils james reminded her as they began to climb the staircase across from the lobby sirius shrugged they didntsay anything was wrong he answered anyways it on this floor he stopped climbing the staircase and gestured down the corridor which clearly led to the maternity ward heart fluttering in anticipation lily followed sirius as he led the way down the hall and past many busy healers and hysterical family members here it is he announced regally gesturing to a ward lily and james entered ahead of him and hurried to the farthest bed of three the curtains were drawn and they could hear frank low rumbling voice giving encouragement who are you a harried looking healer asked them irritably as she rushed past er friends of the longbottoms james answered bad time yes the witch responded hurrying past them yet again the baby about to arrive i ll have to ask you folks to wait in the corridor lily smiled broadly as they obeyed and did a little jog alice is having a baby she said in a sing song voice uncharacteristically losing her composure james smiled warmly at her before engaging in conversation with sirius lost in her own joy lily sortof zoned out until remus peter and cadence came striding down the hall hello all remus said lightly his blue eyes flickering merrily hey moony sirius and james chimed together slapping their fellow marauder on the back hi lily said brightly giving cadence a quick hug how are you i great she smiled in reply i so excited for alice but anyways how are you her voice changed to one of concern i fine lily said mildly impatient everyone making such a fuss over me honestly sorry cadence grinned not looking the least bit apologetic a loud scream suddenly came from the hospital room capturing everyone attention lily winced in apprehension poor alice cadence muttered though she chuckled lightly maybe the healers should use a freezing charm for pain can t lily responded automatically it would hamper the er procedure oh right then cadence muttered turning their attention to the others they found the boys were lost in their own conversation minutes ticked by slowly and lily took a seat in a chair by the door she and cadence made small talk for about twenty before the flustered healer emerged from the room weary but smiling you can go in now she informed them lily immediately hastened into the room avidly followed by the others alice lily cried softly as she pulled back the curtains to visit her friend she was rendered temporarily speechless by the tiny figure frank had in his arms alice had shadows under her eyes and her hair was a mess but she looked happier then lily had ever seen her save for her wedding day congratulations you two james said happily conjuring a bouquet of flowers with his wand he set them on the bedside table as lily and cadence moved forwards to embrace their friend how are you feeling cadence asked warmly peering closely at their peaky looking friend fine alice said non chalantly her voice tinged with tiredness that good lily smiled so what did you name er him alice supplied smiling widely we ve named him neville her tone positively emanated adoration for her new son aw i so happy for you lily gushed thanks alice answered and they all spent the next little while conversing and taking turns holding neville lily thought she would positively melt when she held the pudgy little round raced boy all too soon however the healer returned and ushered the lot of them from the room alice needed rest and the healer was going to take neville to the nursery for a closer health inspection they re so happy together james commented as he and lily made their way to the tea room cadence and sirius had gone to the hospital gift shop with remus and peter as they strolled up the staircase the afternoon sunshine poured in through the windows warming their faces yeah lily said wistfully that will be us soon james grinned broadly and took hold of lily hand she closed the gap between them and kissed him quickly as they reached the top floor after collecting their tea they took their seat at a small table and drunk in silence reliving the busy morning it was hard to believe that the day could get any better but within moments lily felt her stomach fill with butterflies she froze her vivid green eyes widening to the size of galleons as she shakily set her cup of tea on the table she gazed nervously at james who was staring obliviously into the distance james she said tentatively she hardly dared to believe what had just happened and yet she was sure james she said more persistently when he appeared not to have heard her yes love he asked mildly still not looking at her i think my water just broke lily half whispered she brushed her red bangs out of her face and waited for james reaction that nice lils he muttered uncomprehending what she had just said james she said sharply her heart rate speeding up in anxiety hmm he asked turning his hazel eyes to meet her green ones she gaze him a pointed look and slowly a change came across james face wait what now he asked his full attention finally on her she nodded nervously and he led out a startling whoop lily he exclaimed joyfully jumping to his feet and pulling her to hers he kissed her quickly then said in a voice breathless with excitement we have to get you downstairs you dontsay she mumbled then wincing as a brief and rather mild contraction swept over her she felt a distinct difference in her abdomen james gave her a look of mingled anticipation and concern come on he said taking her arm and helping her towards the stairs she nodded speechless and allowed him to help her down the stairs they ran into sirius and cadence as they arrived back on the maternity level hey prongs hey lily sirius said distractedly check out these cards they have in the gift shop they cast a giddiness spell on the opener not now padfoot james said as he brushed past them lily in tow lily going into labour for a moment their was a stunned silence and then cadence broke it with an excited shriek merlin lily she trilled you too oh this is the best sirius was wearing an expression equivalent to having just been hit with a stupefying hex half a second later he was wearing a grin of raucous joy lily managed a small smile as another contraction died away come on lily james said gently guiding her down the hallway oi you there my wife going into labour he called to a passing healer with curly grey hair and kind blue eyes the witch halted in her tracks immediately she gave lily an encouraging smile right this way then she said giving them her full attention she helped lily to an empty room and to a bed and then gave her a hospital gown to change into i ll be back in a moment with another healer just make yourselves comfortable the witch said kindly before bustling out of the room humming a small tune lily settled into the pillows and waited silently as cadence and sirius hurried into the room they seemed to have run into remus and peter on the way for they entered the room shortly after lily waited nervously james holding her hand all the while the healers returned and after a quick check over declared her perfectly healthy they informed her that the baby should come around sometime that evening and that so far there were no complications the others talked quietly around her until evening fell upon them at last lily hardly listened to what they were saying her mind focused on surviving the pain of the contractions and the thoughts of what was finally happening at last several times cadence remus or peter would flit out of the room to check on alice but they always returned quickly sirius however flat out refused to leave the bedside as the hours drew on the healers returned to check on her hmm you re moving along a bit slower then we anticipated the grey haired witch informed her after a few health determining spells everything still looks fine though we ll be back in a bit she turned to james call us if anything happens with a last nod she swept out of the room lily bit her lip drawing blood as another wave of pain washed over her by now the back of her neck was damp with sweat cadence used her wand to tie it up for her thanks she gasped and then squinted her eyes as yet another bout of pain engulfed her she was so distracted by the agony of it all that she missed james wince as she mercilessly squeezed his hand as yet another hour passed slowly by sirius was still practically bouncing in his chair in excitement while remus and peter had been initially enthusiastic their reactions had somewhat settled and they were now passing the time with a game of exploding snap cadence in the glory of her boredom went looking for trouble sirius she said sweetly maybe we should start a family sirius distracted from his abundant joy gave her a look of astonishment what he asked dumbfounded maybe we should start a family cadence repeated fluttering her eyelashes at him sirius gave james a look that clearly called for help cadence er are you sure you two are ready to take that step james asked attempting to help his friend out stay of it james cadence said lightly but giving him a warning glance sorr ow james yelped as lily grip tightened painfully as the clock struck eleven thirty the healers re entered to find sirius and cadence in a full blown argument sirius stopped dead sentence and waited avidly for the healers to give their pronouncement she ready a young looking witch reported she smiled at the rest of them you ll have to wait in the hall sirius immediately jumped to his feet and darted out the door good luck he called cadence shook her head in exasperation and followed him with a last encouraging smile at james and lily remus and peter followed them with similar actions within minutes more healers had entered and were prepared for the birth just keep pushing one healer counseled lily she nodded with a grimace her face reddening with the strain the healers quickly cast a few mild charms on lily to numb the pain and then one turned to james she muttered a quick spell her wand pointed at his right hand which was stuck tight in lily grasp what that for he asked in confusion feeling a tingle of warmth spread through his fingers for numbing the pain she said wisely in response you ll need it and sure enough lily grip on his fingers tightened immensely as she gave a groan of effort within minutes the atmosphere changed rapidly james did his best to assure and encourage lily as she faced now constant pain a quick half glance at the clock showed the time to be eleven fifty any minute now the healer said with a smile james returned it knowing that within minutes his and lily lives would change forever 000 can we go back in yet sirius asked anxiously pacing the hallway it was the fiftieth time since they had been sent out that he had asked that particular question and for the fiftieth time remus sighed in response no sirius they ll tell us when and please stop asking you re not the only one that excited right sorry sirius muttered continuing to pace the hallway i cantbelieve it cadence said breaking the momentary silence alice and lily on the same day not necessarily remus reminded her lightly it almost midnight still cadence protested everyone lapsed into silence again sirius stopped pacing for a moment to check his watch twelve o one it read just as he opened his mouth to repeat his earlier question the door swung upon gently then elderly witch beamed at them you can come in now she said in a hushed voice sirius nearly bowled her over in his haste to get inside lying in bed looking positively exhausted but still grinning ecstatically was lily and in her arms wrapped snugly in a soft blue blanket was the tiny face of their child the baby eyes were shut as he had just fallen asleep and atop his head was a mess of raven black hair james too was smiling as though he had never been happier a distinct look of pride in his eyes as he gazed at his child it a boy lily whispered beaming at her friends our little harry cadence promptly burst into tears and remus said a quiet congratulations peter was expressionless but sirius his look was priceless grinning like a lunatic he approached the bedside looking ready to laugh and cry at the same time do you want to hold him lily asked gently sirius nodded wordlessly totally enamored by the little boy in his arms he took the baby tiny little hand in his own and whispered my godson as lily watched the two of them she shared a look with james both couldnthave been happier at their friend obvious joy sirius had been james best friend forever and like a brother to lily and now he stood holding their son the first bit of family he could actually love it meant the world to lily to see him in such bliss it took a little persuading to convince sirius to let the other hold harry but he reluctantly complied cadence held him close tears still pouring silently down her face before handing him off to remus although he was polite and held harry for a short time so that peter could have a turn there was clear affection in his gaze finally peter awkwardly took the baby and held him at arm length almost immediately harry stirred and awoke here james said removing harry from peter grasp he took him and with a father pride began rocking his son in his arms lily felt tears spring to her eyes at the sight there was entire world the very reason she breathed standing together not a care in the world if only things could remain so but pushing the shadows from her heart she let the warmth of love overwhelm her senses this was what she lived for author note okay this chapter was both later and earlier then i expected i had computer troubles and initially postponed the date but then i had access to a

much gifts and affection cadence had bought both neville and harry heaps of little jumpers and various outfits while lupin provided many different toys peter didntseem too enthused by the newest additions to the potter and longbottom houses but brought over a slightly withered bouquet of flowers all the same sirius however remained the most excited second only to james and herself it was only minutes after she had arrived home that lily found herself immersed in an argument with her son godfather there is no way in bloody hell lily said fiercely that you are taking harry out on that gigantic motorcycle of yours lily sirius protested it perfectly safe there are enchantments and charms that will prevent him from falling off and do you really believe i d put my godson in danger james was hovering at the edge of the living room looking on as his wife and best mate argued remus who was there too was watching the two of them a mildly amused look on his face as he cradled harry in his arms sirius lily cried in exasperation we re talking about the you who used to sneak off with a werewolf every month no offense remus but honestly sirius you have no concept of danger i do too sirius retored indignantly besides this is different it not my own neck but harry s i would never do anything that could harm him you know that the answer is still no lily said firmly even if i was confident about the saftey of that dratted motorcycle i doubt he d like it very much anyways sirius opened his mouth to protest but lily cut him off no sirius he a newborn motorcycles are noisy and fast he d probably be scared my son would not be scared james put in for the first time lily shot him a murderous glare come off it james she said irritably she took harry back from remus now if you dontmind i going upstairs to get some sleep i exhausted and i d thank you all to not disturb us and with a last annoyed glance at the three former maurauders she marched upstairs harry gurgling in her arms come on sweetie lily cooed her voice losing it irritance time for a nap harry just gazed at her his bright blue eyes sleepy she smiled and tapped his nose affectionately with a mess of already raven dark hair it was clear that harry would take after his father as lily layed her son down in the crib she pondered whether his now innocent blue eyes would turn out to be a warm hazel or bright green night harry lily whispered dimming the candle light in the baby room with her wand sleep well my son 000 as the weeks past neville and harry grew rapidly as did their parents love for them never before had lily and alice known love quite like this in their sons was a part of them and their husbands how could life contain anything more perfect much to the their surprise dumbledore seemed to take a keen interest in the babies this became apparent to lily on the night of the first order meeting she had attended since after the birth after having been showered by much fondess by the rest of the order dumbledore had approached the hapy couples individually congragulations james lily he said serenely coming over to them after having conversed with the longbottoms harry is it yes sir lily said offering her blanket wrapped son to their old headmaster he took the bundle and gazed at the baby a mix of cheer curiosity and was it nervousness a new hope in a time of great darkness he finally sighed handing the child back to lily tell me know you ve both escaped voldemort three times now is that correct er yes sir james said looking surprised as he considered this i guess so but why do you ask no reason dumbledore replied airily just thinking young harry here is very fortunate to have such deserving parents james smiled proudly and rested a hand on lily arm thank you he said hazel eyes glowing with warmth dumbledore bowed to them and then slowly strode away but not before lily caught a distinctly odd gleam in his wise blue eyes she frowned was there sadness there what was it that their leader was hiding from there or was it anything at all perhaps he thought it a bad time for a child to enter the world lily glanced down at her sleeping baby and vowed then and there to protect her son to the best of her ability she would not let anything befall him 000 as the august warmth faded away into the chilling winds of autumn life seemed to take on a quicker route guility both lily and alice were glad that they had reason to not involve themselves overly in the order activites as each day progressed it seemed that more misfortunes were plaguing their lives attacks were so numerous now lily thought it reasonable that every leaf falling from the trees could be accounted for by some dementor inferius or death eater attack it soon became clear to the lot of them that they were fighting a losing war already they had suffered heavy losses to the order carardoc dearborn dorcas meadowes and benjy fenwick had all been killed in battle only the other day had the bones family been found dead in their home and to make matters worse no clue to callidora disappearence had yet been discovered although lily and alice tried to channel their sadness away into caring for their newborns it was impossible to escape the ever striking lightning of voldemort wrath as the danger increased tenfold lily resolve to use every bit of her moral fibre intelligence and love to protect her son grew stronger whenever harry was napping she would immerse herself in books filled with information on ancient magic protection spells and potions sirius worried that she was suffering the after effects of her pregnancy she now spent so much time reading but she assured him she was merely concerned even james was working harder then ever auror training was progressing and he had accomplished so much he had been moved ahead early to a higher level of training frank and alice who had already achieved full auror status due to their achievements the last year were also totally focused on anything that would help in the war and the protection of their families even peter seemed to be spurred to work harder then usual or so lily and james suspected by his appearence there were shadows under his eyes and his skin seemed to have taken on a paler gaunter look then usual even his light mousy hair had grown lank he continued work for the order alongside the rest of them remus and sirius had also become quite distracted never before had the order been so busy remus was actively working undercover to try and discover which werewolves were on voldemort side while sirius had been assigned along with some others to researching giant involvement several times already they had been sent on missions to halt the furious creature rampaging much to lily dismay james too was quite caught up in the whirlwind of it all he and frank had been given leadership of the effort to stop the dementors and death eaters it was a task dumbledore told the others was highly dangerous but extremely important the headmaster had apologized to both wives for having to assign their husbands such perilous missions but told them it was their only choice they were losing to many people to keep shunting other capable wizards to the side this did nothing to raise lily moral proud as she was of james and still in their every spare moment lily and james spent their time fawning over harry lily scrapbooked everything from his first smile to his first noises he was developing at a healthy rate already he was able to hold his rattle and recognized and trusted a few certain people she and james of course were his most familiar as was sirius but harry was also beginning to respond to remus cadence alice frank and strangely dumbledore the few times lily went to the meetings he listened in unusually rapt attention to the elderly wizards comforting yet commandng voice also unusual was harry firm dislike of peter though lily suspected that he was lacking in his children skills she had not anticipated harry intense wailing every time peter held him or spoke it had become so bad that peter had rather stopped coming around so much 000 before long christmas time arrived it was hard to believe that the holidays had at last arrived when everything around them seemed to dark and dangerous it was the day before christmas and both cadence and alice were over at the potter place james and frank were of course still at work and sirius was doing something for the order the three girls neville and harry had gotten together to decorate a large christmas tree and put up other decorations around lily house i remember that it was at christmas time you and james first kissed lily cadence said reminiscently as she hung garland over the prickly branches lily grinned at the memory yeah it was minutes after i stopped hating him i dontthink you ever really hated him lils alice said distractly as she pulled the tinsel away from neville who seemed to think it was something tasty to eat lily and cadence looked at her incredulously lily not hate james then cadence asked articulately she then burst into hysterical laughter you re mad alice scooped neville off the floor and into her arms she gave cadence a cross look there a difference between strong dislike and hate cady maybe lily agreed while cadence continued to look doubtful it was very very veeeery strong dislike then i used to loathe his demeanor sure is strange how we ended up though and she gestured at harry who was surveying the various baubles in a box looking awed by the glittery colours true alice said with a smile now why dontwe let these two little rascals put on the star lily grinned as she picked up harry and summoned the star at the same time both women let the two babies grasp it loosely in their tiny hands as they held them over their heads towards the top of the tree go on neville harry alice cooed encouragingly put it on top the babies looked down at them in confusion and harry began to whimper lily immediatly took him down and held him close it okay sweetie you donthave to put it on if you dontwant too lily murmured holding his petite hands fondly harry immediatly ceased his crying alice took neville down too and he promptly set the star atop her head alice chuckled not there neville wingardium leviosa neville watched in wonder as alice used magic to set the ornament atop the tree he laughed in delight once it was on top alice grinned i love being a mother she sighed kissing her son on the forehead 000 christmas came and went without too much disturbance if you dontcount the emergency order meeting later that day as it turned out the death eaters had staged a morbidly festive murder in a muggle community in the heart of london it was a horrible reawakening to the war around them and as the holidays passed work picked up once again it was the middle of february when lily dared take harry out she wished that james was there to accompany them but he had auror training she had tried the others but cadence too had work and alice had taken neville to visit his grandmother she would have delayed the outing but today had been the only day she had been able to convince dumbledore to let her use the hogwarts library the students would all be busy with activies on the grounds it was valentines day seeing as hogsmeade trips had been banned and so they had agreed that the library should be rather empty lily had not been willing to use apparation to transport herself and harry as it was dangerous for a young baby and so she had opted to use the floo network before long she had landed spinning in the emerald flames of a fireplace inside the three broomsticks harry began to cry from the experiance and lily hastily tried to comfort him as she stepped outside into the flurry of snow rocking him in her arms she trudged through the snow being careful to keep harry blanket wrapped securely around his fragile body by the time she reached the castle he was fast asleep dumbledore greeted her by the doors mrs potter he said formally he glanced at the dozing baby in her arms and smiled with the same sadness she had seen in his eyes when he had first set gaze on her child hello professor she said gladly stepping into the warmth of the castle i afraid i due to host a staff meeting shortly and i will not be able to accompany you in your research i trust you know your way to the library he asked apologetically yes sir quite well in fact newts and owls made sure of that lily replied with a small smile very well dumbledore said good luck and with that he strode away leaving lily alone with harry she shook her head to clear it and headed for the library lily madam pince said in shock as lily entered the warm book filled room dumbledore mentioned that someone would be coming but he didntsay who it been ages and oh her beady eyes widened as she caught sight of harry lily smiled and pushed her red hair out of her face yes ma am it been awhile so who the lucky father madam pince asked lily felt rather odd conversing with her old librarian as though they had been old friends which they had most certainly not been madam pince had never shown any friendliness to the students she suspected the witch merely wanted something to gossip about she seemed to be the type who was greedy for knowledge er james potter lily answered hesitantly madam pince looked as though she had been struck dumb potter she asked in disbelief the infamous potter but you hated him yes well things change lily murmured distractedly harry was beginning to stir now if you dontmind i need to look at a few books of course go right ahead the elderly witch said still looking shocked lily thanked her and found a table at the back of the room she conjured a small baby carrier for harry and layed him in it after making sure he was still fast asleep she removed her winter cloak and went to find the books she was looking for magic of the medieval ages primitive potions the beginning ages were some of the titles lily managed to find from the dusty shelves she returned to the table and flipped through them quill and parchment ready to take notes but there was nothing that seemed even remotely useful for protection of for aid in the effort against voldemort sighing she returned them to her respectful places and reluctantly approached madam pince excuse me ma am may i use the restricted section madam pince eyed her suspiciously but eventually agreed though it looked against her better judgement relieved lily entered the restricted zone and began checking the titles there two books immediatly caught her interest aborignal ancients and the magic in love removing them from the shelves they were on she carried them back and opened the first on on ancient native american practices she found several things that she scribbled down the fideler ritual a practice whereby ancestral artifacts are hidden from rivalling tribes with only one person knowing the location could this be used on people amulets combining potions and stones with similiar properties to enhance certain properties harry and james in the book she also found an interesting section mentioning various herbs and stones which had different properties she jotted a few of these down as well becoming increasingly interested in amulets stones malachite protection stone for children wards against evil quartz amplify magical abilities ward against evil amber purifies mind body and spirit apache tears assist in grieving process helps break down barriers obsidian dispels negativity healing protective helps one to see flaws in themselves and change it ruby love and protection herbs agrimony acts as a deflective shield sends back negativity angelica strongly protective balm of gilead protective in love matters camphor used to protect against mental intrusion once she had finished aboriginal ancients she opened the magic in love even as she opened the page she felt a warmth tingle in her fingers and something seemed to embolden inside of her all at once she felt her motherly protection ardor and love for her friends and family surge inside her and instinctively knew that only one with such intense feelings could read this book flipping through a few page of deep knowledge and writings but nothing particularly useful her eyes finally fell upon a short verse call upon the magic of old love verses a soul that is sold gone but not lost forever comes with a cost lily read the short poem over and over again curiosity peaked as she went over it for the fifth time she whispered it aloud and felt a tingle run up her spine as warmth spread from her fingers to her toes the hair on the back of her neck rose and she glanced at harry he had awoken and was staring at her his turquoise y eyes wide did you feel that too sweetie she asked feeling very peculiar from that experiance harry babbled something and she kissed him on the cheek she hesitated for a moment quill poised over the parchment wondering whether or not to write down the verse it was clearly a very powerful spell after debating with herself for several more moments she made up her mind and decided to write it but in a way that only her gaze would be able to decipher it lily quickly cast a very advanced and complicated spell then surveyed the parchment she had just written the poem on to anyone else eyes it would merely look like a bunch of random symbals she decided to test it quickly on madam pince excuse me ma am she said calling the librarian over to her do you think you could tell me what this means madam pince gave her a look that clearly said she had better things to do but scanned the paper anyways i dontknow she said shortly bunch of random hogwash if you ask me right lily said hiding her satisfaction thanks madam pince huffed and swept off again to her desk lily smiled at harry glad it had worked well harry i think we ve made some progress shall we head home to see daddy she cooed dadda harry babbled and lily emerald eyes sparkled with delight your first word she exclaimed picking up her son and hugging him with adoration aw harry as she set him back down she surveyed him curiously wondering whether all the magic she had been dabbling with had caused this it was rather early for him to start speaking lily shrugged it off collected her books and made to put them away she was eager to tell james what she had discovered and about harry accomplishment he would be so proud as she wandered through the restricted section replacing the novels she had borrowed her eyes fell upon a black leather book jutting out slightly from the shelf which was precisely beside magic in love furrowing her eyebrows she removed it and glanced at the title the dark arts demonicy instantly she knew she was looking at a dangerous book the very thing seemed to emantate a cold chill of forbidding yet gripped with curiosity and wondering whether this could be useful she hesitantly brought it back to the table and sat a distance from harry she felt she had better keep it away from him she flipped through the pages ignoring the awful feeling that came with reading the text of the pages all warmth from her previous readings had evaporated it felt as though she were holding the saga of dementors in her delicate hands she took her quill and parchment again ready to take more notes when she skimmed over a section about a most curious tool of evil horcruxes mouth hanging slightly open she read the section on it with horror as she turned the next page a piece of parchment slid out she glanced at it in confusion it was written in a language she could not understand serispito perisss lispessto perisss fresssin lissssti herisset lissssti tresset perisss lisspenss serissanto perisss grisssin lissssti thinking that it was possibly encoded she slipped it amongst her other notes worrying all the while what she had just read was the most powerful of magic the most dangerous how many others had read this book before her feeling extremely guilty and nervous she carried the book back to the restricted section and gave it a mistrustful look suddenly a thought surfaced students really shouldntbe reading this lily thought what if she just took it with her this way she would have valuable research and the book would never fall into the wrong hands making up her mind she glanced around anxiously and shrunk the book she quickly stuffed it into her pocket and then gathered her notes and harry new ideas forming in her head as she made her way back to hogsmeade through the snow and past the shouting and laughing students she continued thinking hard as the snow whirled around her she couldnthelp but feel her thoughts were in the same motion author note first of all i apologize for postponing this i went on a short vacation and just didnthave time to get this up before as well i know this chapter has a bit of a time jump but nothing much happened in between and i didntwant to bore you i now in major research mode both for baby developement and things like the metaphyscal properties of rocks and herbs lily notes are going to be very important in forthcoming chapters very and also after i finished this story the end is approaching i ve decided to do a sortof sequel though it will take place where the sixth book left off and will lean heavily on what has been in this story so anyways dontworry there still quite a few chapters to go but i d just thought i d let you know about my plans for another story i ll update soon hope you enjoyed i know this chapter was a bit odd before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 39 the changing fates on the way home lily and harry stopped at diagon alley lily had initially purchased a new wrist watch for james but considering the research she had just done decided she may as well add something to the gift as she traipsed past the heaps of snow that lined the streets harry sleeping soundly in her arms she looked around for a jewellery store of sorts aha she whispered triumphantly as she spotted a small shop crammed between two other larger ones the cracking bronze lettering on the front of the building read muggle and magic gems lily eagerly entered the shop extracting her notes for assitance hello said a middle aged witch from behind the counter she had stringy brown hair and dull brown eyes she was wearing a name tag that read alynne renwood can i help you she inquired politely yes actually lily replied scanning her notes quickly i looking for something with ruby and something with malachite she checked her notes again oh and maybe some quartz crystal the witch named alynne surveyed her customer curiously as she listed her requests right this way she finally said once lily had finished speaking we ve got a nice selection of semi precious stones over here did you want muggle stones or magically powered ones lily followed alynne over to a display case full of various bright glittering stones she considered the issue for a moment muggle i suppose she decided thinking that she d rather magically empower them herself right o alynne said here is our ruby selection and the malachite a little to the left i ll show you our quartz supply afterwards lily nodded and examined the various pendants and stones set inside the glass the rubies glowed slightly red as the light caught them after contemplating the selection for a while her eyes finally fell upon a gold ring with ruby inlaid she felt her breath catch that one she said in a hushed voice pointed to it alynne summoned a key to her with her wand and unlocked the glass display case she lightly removed the ring and gave it to lily to see that one about fifteen galleons alynne explained made of pure gold and one of the more valuable rubies it a bargain at that price lily scowled slightly a bargain eh still this ring gave her a good feeling and she really felt she needed it fine but only if you throw in one of the chains with it lily shrugged gesturing to a large supply of chains which hung on the wall alynne considered this for a moment then nodded fine by me she agreed lily smiled and slipped a gold chain from off a hook she then turned her gaze to the malachite and felt her eyes immediatly drawn to a pendant it was a small circular piece of malachite with an ancient rune carved onto it instantly she wished she had taken ancient runes back at hogwarts what it mean lily asked breathlessly her grip around harry slumbering body tightening oh that just the rune ihwaz alynne said carelessly it the rune of defense corresponding to the magical number thirteen and the yew tree the rune of defense lily asked feeling that it could be very useful in her efforts what does it do well it long been linked with death but in actuality it simply means the continuacy and endurance of past life it also helps in saftey against attack and is a weapon of defense alynne continued to explain non chalantly would you like to see it lily nodded mutely thinking of how perfect this stone would be for harry protection thanks lily said softly as she delicately took the pendant and let it dangle from it chain a shiver seemed to run down her spine as she held it and harry awoke immediatly rubbing his sleepy eyes with his uncoordinated hands he spotted the malachite and made a lunge for it lily smiled as her son took it in his hands and tasted it curiously how much for this piece ten galleons alynne answered would you like me to ring those in for you sure lily replied gently removing the chain from harry eager mouth oh but first the quartz right you are alynne said leading them to yet another section harry squealed in delight as he layed eyes on the wide selection of brightly shimmering crystals is there any that could be shaped lily asked examining a particarly jagged one oh yes it a simple spell really the only stones you cantreshape by magic are diamond amber pearl and moonstone so those would be quite fine alynne informed her right lily mused i ll take this one then i think she pointed to a rather long piece it was exactly the right shape for her intended purpose alynne nodded happily and took her purchases to the counter that ll be thirty galleons and two sickles please she said quickly adding up the total lily ignored the guilt she felt at the elaborate cost but dug the coins out of her money pouch nonetheless thank you ma am have a nice day keep safe alynne said briskly gladly accepting the change and handing lily her purchases thanks lily answered as she exited the shop i intend to without wasting another second lily swept up the street and back to the leaky cauldron where she and harry were whisked home in emerald flames 000 later that evening as harry was sleeping soundly upstairs james and lily enjoyed a romantic dinner it was the first time in a long time they had been able to enjoy each other company in such peace lily almost wished the night would never end so what did you and harry end up doing today james asked as they finished the last of the dishes with magic lily smiled thinking of all that had taken place we went to the hogwarts library oh james you wontbelieve everything i learned there lily explained eager to share her knowledge with her husband james came up behind her and kissed her in the crook of the neck not all boring book talk when there so much else we could be doing he raised an eyebrow suggestively and lily had to fight back a giggle james it not boring at all let me explain and then we have the rest of the night to do whatever we please lily said firmly she beckoned james to follow her to the living room where they both curled up on the sofa so what is it you re so eager to tell me james asked looking extremely impatient lily immediatly launched into an explanation of the days events i researched into the process of making amulets and got a few things for them and i discovered several interesting rituals used by the natives of north america there this one called the fideler ritual and i was thinking maybe it could be used on people it used for hiding things and so if voldemort were after say a certain member of the order we could easily protect them lily gushed also she lowered her voice nervously i read into horcruxes and discovered an ancient spell horcruxes james asked in complete bewilderment trying to soak in all his wife was telling him i ve never heard of them well most people haven t i mean it an awful thing really lily informed him her voice low with forbidding it when someone well mutilates their soul and hides it in something this way they cantreally die if their own body is killed but that good isntit james asked we could use it in the order it would be really useful no james lily exclaimed aghast it an evil thing you can only do it by killing someone and souls arentmeant to be torn apart it would make you well demonic almost you musntbreathe a word of it to anyone i won t james muttered looking very shocked that awful imagine what voldemort would do with that knowledge we know he loathes the idea of death yeah lily agreed then added in an undertone hopefully he doesntknow already james and lily remained silent for a moment contemplating the odds of that possibility dumbledore will have seen to it james finally stated with confidence he must know almost everything lily shrugged anyhow seeing as it is valentine day she said gazing into his eyes i did pick something up for you and harry but i ll get to that in a minute but you already gave me the watch james mused something unreadable dancing in his eyes lily gently removed the ruby ring from her pocket and held it out to james it made of ruby she explained it protects the one you love therefore i am giving you the protection of my love for you james took it peering at it closely looking touched beyond belief thanks lils he said breathlessly he kissed her passionately and when they broke apart lily spoke up again i let it simmer in a potion with balm of gilead angelica camphor and other substances all are highly protective and camphor will boost your occlumency skills i ve also applied liberal charms to it i really canttell you how much this means to me lily james said looking awestruck you donthave to tell me anything lily said the corners of her mouth twitching james smirked at her hang on just one second who said we were done exchanging gifts lily smiled feeling pleasent surprise course through her veins oh she asked softly james pulled out a small box of black velvet he handed it to her wordlessly and lily opened it not breathing inside laying on the plush velvet was a gorgeous ring it had a silver band and in the centre was a brightly gleaming amber stone how did you know she whispered slipping it on to her finger tears forming in her eyes know what james asked clearly confused james amber is used to purify the soul heart and mind it perfect it also a stone of connecting lily explained awestruck james shook his head you and your research he muttered though not sounding bitter at all lily kissed him lightly thank you she whispered james smiled at her lily cleared her throat and cleared her mind she wanted to tell james one last thing before they settled down i was thinking lily said choosing her words carefully what if i used these amulets to make sortof a well reverse horcrux lily hastened to explain herself as a dark shadow crossed james face reverse like i wouldnthave to do someone in i was just thinking what if i charmed these so that if well one of us were ever killed a bit of our soul would enter the other amulet what do you mean james asked clearly not following what she was saying lily sighed and removed the malachite pendant from her jean pocket she showed it to james i going to brew this in agrimony to deflect negative energy and give it to harry it a stone for protecting children against evil the rune on it is for defense i thought that i could somehow charm it so that if one of us died our soul might enter harry pendant lily explained cautiously even she didntknow how she planned to achieve it but she knew she had to try it seemed a good enough idea james bowed his head in thought that seems like a good idea he said but it would only work for harry s wouldntit lily frowned at him why well it would be much too complicated magic to send your soul to both amulets i sure it will be hard enough with one if it even possible james told her patiently you said amber purifies the soul then it would be perfect to channel your soul to harry amulet but what about you lily asked wide eyed realizing that amber was the perfect tool lily i promise to do everything in my power to keep you and harry safe this is a mere precaution will you just work on that for the time being james said his voice set with resolution please lily contemplated it before nodding i suppose good now that all this talk of darkness is out of the way i believe we had plans did we lily said feigning a faulty memory im afraid you ll have to remind me mr potter james raised an eyebrow as he pulled her closer gladly 000 as ever the week seemed to fly by with the usual amount of violence war and rare moments of peace even the returning summer warmth couldntovercome the cold chill the demontors emanated lily thought she would have been rather depressed what with james always at work if it hadntbeen for harry she spent every spare moment with him teaching him new words playing with him he could crawl now and he and neville would often play together when alice stopped by lily also began to take on some order work she had explained some of her discoveries to dumbledore and he had placed her in charge of providng various means of defensive practices she had already charmed a load of apache tears and had a ready supply to hand to those who had lost loved ones although they couldnttake away the pain of the loss they did help the families move on and take protective measures as well she had been brewing large supplies of potions with camphor added to it already they had majorly aided in the fight against legilimens death eaters were having to work twice as hard to extract the information they desired to add to this success dumbledore promised to look further into the fideler ritual agreeing with lily that it could be quite useful for hiding those targeted by voldemort he had also acquired the assitance of professor flitwick from school and his brother aberforth in the matter lily had also taken on some more personal projects she had taken the quartz she had bought and shaped it so that it could work as a handle around the lower bit of her wand it amplified the magic of her unicorn hair wand core immensely seemingly chanelling the energy into the stone before shooting the spell the first time lily tried it with the quartz was a simple summoning spell she had been calling harry toy broom over when the force of the spell caused the broom to completely knock her off her feet after that incident she had been sure to excercise more caution in her spells everything would have seemed to have been going rather well excluding of course the violence and war incidents harry first birthday came and went with lily finally relenting to let sirius take him on a quick spin of his motorcycle harry was delighting and couldntstop giggling for hours afterwards although lily wasntsure whether or not this was a result of the ride of the giddiness cake they had fed him life was as good as it could be in such a time 000 how fares the mudblood and her blood traitor pal voldemort asked viciously pacing the gloomy interior of their hideaway peter cowered at the vengeance in his voice f f f ine my lord the children will have aged a year by now peter blurted fear echoing in ever syllable of his voice voldemort fixed him with his malevolent red eyes has either shown any unusual powers n n n o my l lord peter stuttered cowering as voldemort laughed mirthfully pathetic and i suppose you ve not suspected which one the prophecy indicates voldemort asked harshly though he seemed quite unconcerned about the issue o of c c c ourse not peter whimpered b but woudlntit b b e the p pureblood crucio voldemort cried quite unexpectedly peter immediatly fell to the floor writhing and shrieking with pain when the first was finally lifted he lay there curled on the floor sobbing get up you scum voldemort spat angrily you underestimate mudbloods dirty and as unworthy as they are i myself have been cursed by a muggle filthy blood it is in the halfblood i think that lies our chosen p p otter kid peter whimpered his face now radiating pure fear and despair s s urely no he was forced to stop speaking as the cruciatus curse hit him again this time however the pain did not last for as long you re not doubting your allegiance are you wormtail voldemort hissed menacingly peter shook his head frantically pressing himself againt the wall of the dirty room in attempts to put as much distance between himself and his master as possible dontlie to me voldemort snapped i always know always he let his voice drop to a tone much softer m my lord how can i i be of a a ssitance in yor pl a ans peter asked pressing himself to the floor at voldemort feet now he let fear direct his actions now voldemort sneered downwards at him ready yourself tonight we shall meet with the others and announce our plans the potters shall not live past the next full moon voldemort answered his voice cruel and cold in his burning crimson eyes blazed anticipation the fates were shifting and the times changing with the prophesized one out of the way domination would come in a bloodbath author note sorry if this chapter was a little boring just preparing for what we all know is about to happen it probably wontbe next chapter though the one after that maybe i ve had to do so much research for the last few chapters but like i said it all going to be very important in the sequel anyways please please please check out the forum for this story hope you enjoyed and i ll update soon before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem

moment they got their schedules alice cadence and lily all aspired to become aurors and consequently they were required to take a fair many classes cadence was taking care of magical creatures on the side and alice and lily had decided to add arithmancy to their already crowded schedules calli who was a chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team wanted to play quidditch after hogwarts thus she wasntrequired to obtain any newts but was taking defense against the dark arts charms and transfiguration for practical reasons serena had wanted to be a healer and was therefore required to take the same courses as an auror would but she had decided not to take any extra subjects on the side that morning everyone excluding callidora made their way to potions which happened to be their first class upon arriving the four girls grabbed a table together and began setting up their cauldrons and supplies good morning class proffesor slughorn boomed merrily good morning the class chanted in reply ahh lily how are you good summer i presume proffesor slughorn asked genially singling out his favorite student lily nodded mutely as always she was was rather embaressed to recieve slughorn extra attention good good now today seeing as it is our first day back we will be doing a simple potion that is likely to appear on your newts it is a potion used on severe cuts abrasions and bites slughorn explained prompting serena to sit a little straighter in her seat although it effects are simple enough the potion is competent for your level so please follow the insturctions carefully he threw a meaningful glance towards james and remus the only two marauders to make the class instructions are on the board please proceed lily immediatly set to work taking extra care to be precise in her cutting and stirring beside her alice had also begun to work grumbling occasionaly as she encountered a tricky direction serena meanwhile seemed to be having no trouble at all in fact she was already on the tenth line of instruction cadence however was a different story she was still staring blankly at the board lily she croaked i dontget what the first line means lily sighed she should have seen this coming cadence was a complete disaster at potions it was a miracle she had passed her owls two years ago only tedious and relentless studying had gotten her a pass you have to mix the skin and jelly in an upward motion sortof like a reverse funnel motion lily explained patiently cadence nodded still looking mildly uncertain and began to cut her supplies time is up slughorn announced peering at their faces through the thick smoke now wafting through the classroom from their cauldrons your potions should now be thick and creamy it should also be acid green or at least close to it he informed the students he then began to lumber towards various tables a clipboard in hand as he graded each student finally he reached the girls table and what have we got here he asked cheerfully as he peered into alice cauldron her potion was a light green only it wasntthick in fact in was down right runny slughorn made a tutting noise and moved to cadence cauldron which he backed away from immediatly her potion was a murky brown and was emitting the stench of dirty socks a p then he said sympathetically dontworry dear it takes a bit of practice ah now ms evans ms dresi serena potion was a light green and creamy lily matched the expectations perfectly it was acid green and very thick slughorn positively beamed at them an outstanding for and ms dresi i think an e is in order lily and serena exchanged a pleased and rather triumphant glance they then waited patiently as slughorn quickly finished his rounds and excused the class well that wasnttoo bad was it serena asked as they made their way to charms speak for yourself cadence grumbled i got a p it doesntget much worse then that it okay cadence you ll do better next time lily said soothingly i cantbelieve slughorn gave us that essay alice exclaimed grumpily just because my potion was a bit runny and cadence was well cadence shot her a venomous look well i sure lily and serena can help us seeing as they donthave their own to do how did you two get so good at potions anyways cadence asked lily shrugged and serena mumbled instincts 000 the first day of classes passed quickly and before long the students found themselves back in the common room letting their dinner digest sirius was staring across the room his eyes fixed on cadence who was currently sharing a joke with callidora padfoot why dontyou just take her for a walk james said irritably his previous statement having just gone unnoticed as had the last twenty questions he has issued to his friend immediatly sirius snapped back to life wha oh right yeah maybe i will he said dontforget you ve still got that transfiguration chart to finish remus warned ah dontworry moony i ll have plenty of time to do that later sirius replied casually as he straightened his shirt and stood up good luck peter said his eyes glinting oddly james glanced at him curiously as sirius set off wormtail are you okay he asked suspiciously yeah of course i fine wonderful in fact i think i fancy a walk also he mumbled getting to his feet arubtly what up with him james asked frowning as he watched peter exit through the portrait hole after cadence and sirius remus shrugged and continued on his homework after a moment uncertainty james returned to his homework it had been a pretty mediocre beginning of the year and though it was impossible for the other to know peter had just gotten a lot more interesting a n well here we go chapter four still rather short but i trying to just get the main plot into motion anyways sorry about the delay to update i was reading the new hp book oh my god it so sad at the end i wontsay anything in case you haventread it but yeah anyways please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 40 bleeding tears dumbledore paced swiftly in the serene atmosphere of his office his blue eyes remained focused on the floor and he walked back and forth contemplating everything that had happened that evening what he had feared had become true and what he now feared just might if he didnttake immediate action only hours ago the seemingly impossible had occured one of voldemort own deatheaters had come to him carrying news of the dark lords plans dumbledore may have thought it a trick a tease even a prank had it not been for a very thorough legillimens inspection and the remorse of the man besides why else would a man risk his own neck to save his arch rival unless it were the most serious of conditions there was also the fact that this death eater had a debt to the man at risk as fawkes let out a low musical chirp dumbledore gently awoke from his reverie the phoenix gave him a look that seemed to say it is time with a sigh dumbledore swept his velvet purple cloak from his throne like chair and tossed a handful of floo power into the dying embers of the fire immediatly the flames roared up viridian green and dancing with a last grave realization of what he now was required to do dumbledore stepped regally into the fire and let the flames whirl him away to another place 000 james what the meeting about lily asked bundling harry snugly into his blanket she pulled her own cloak tighter against the cool fall air and waited impatiently for her husband answer i dontknow james muttered distractedly he adjusted his glasses anxiously remus just said it was urgent and that he d wait for us in godric hollow with a portkey from dumbledore you re sure it was remus lily asked nervously not a death eater in disguise or maybe he was under the imperious curse lily it was him trust me we went over the security questions and everything james assured her though he himself didntsound very confident it the topic of the meeting that worries me and not how we re going to get there lily sighed in defeat what could be so important to call a order meeting so late it was already eleven in the evening and she despised being out so late all the recent attacks had definitely put her on edge even moreso then it would ve done because of her beloved harry without another word and refusing to voice her fears lily willingly followed james into the small village of godric hollow lily was just beginning to feel uneasy when remus finally revealed himself under the streetlamp light lily james he sighed in relief i thought perhaps well nevermind come on we d best hurry lily forced herself to give their friend a small smile as she and james moved forwards to take hold of the portkey she held harry more firmly to her as she prepared for the spinning sensation she knew was coming on three remus said breathlessy holding a finger on the empty pop can one two three as remus counted down the last number lily felt the familiar jerk behind her naval and before she knew it she was spinning through the grips of a no world harry remained quite still in her arms but as the wind rushed past her ears she could hear him whimpering in another moment they had landed hard on the rough pavement sidewalk lily recognized them to be on the street just outside of headquarters here james said softly reaching out to take a lightly sobbing harry from lily he took his son and rocked him in his arms trying to comfort him lily would have smiled at the sight but remus was already ushering them out of the cold and inside the building where the meeting was to be held after undoing the intense series of charms that had been applied and giving the password they were granted entrace lily and james eagerly stepped into the softly lit hallway and let the warmth spread through their chilled bodies sirius came into the hallway from another room at their arrival and eagerly made his way towards them hey lily james he said patting them both on the arm hello harry he added brightly his eyes gleaming with adoration as he spotted his godson pah fud harry babbled reaching his tiny arms out towards sirius james passed the toddler to his best mate sirius gazed down at the child for a moment before snapping back to reality oh right the meeting in here he said leading remus lily and james to the room he had stepped out of earlier the five of them entered to find most of the order already there and immersed in conversation as they sat around a rather long oak table lily alice said warmly standing up to greet her friend with a hug hi alice lily smiled where neville alice rolled her eyes franks got him showing him off to the rest of the order as usual he crawling now but you know that from the other day lily laughed yeah they like to do that dontthey i suppose it just fatherly pride yeah alice agreed anyways odd time for a meeting eh it is lily mused letting her worry return to her thoughts i dontsuppose you know why dumbledore called the meeting alice shrugged we ll find out soon enough i guess i just hope it not another giant or death eater attack i really getting sick of this constant worrying for frank i know what you mean lily replied oh here he is as the elderly wizard stepped solemnly into the room everyone instantly fell silent and retook their seats welcome dumbledore sighed inclining his head at the group i apologize for the late time of the meeting but recent events require it when nobody spoke up dumbledore continued before i introduce the most recent member of our organization i must ask for complete calm upon his entrance his eyes flashed warningly in the direction of the marauders this man was a death eater but has come to our side with valuable information and a desire to repent i trust him and i expect you to do so too there was an immediate outbreak of noise as dumbledore finished his statement some people sounded curious others angry moody was looking particularly murderous and james and sirius had narrowed their eyes suspiciously lily remained silence waiting for dumbledore to introduce the turn coat silence dumbledore ordered raising and aged hand to quiet them everyone quieted at once except for harry who let out a soft gurgle dumbledore smiled beignenly at the child before continuing let me please introduce severus snape as a tall thin and rather shadowy figure stepped into the room surveying it contents with pitch black eyes from behind dark greasy hair james and sirius jumped angrily to their feet snivellus they hissed in unison and although remus remained seated even his gaze had hardened unpleasently peter was ill and had not shown up for the meeting yet if he was planning to otherwise lily suspected his reaction would have been similiar james sirius lily exclaimed removing harry from his godfather arms sit down sirius quelled under lily furious gaze but james hesitated lily felt the old anger rise within her the type she used to feel during james unsettling antics back at school sit down she repeated her voice now low and dangerous james hesitantly sat down but refused to stop shooting daggers at his old classmate with a murderous look dumbledore nodded his head at the marauders while snape continued to smirk at them it is a time of unity their will be no tolerance of inner disputes he declared firmly making sure both snape and the marauders understood lily attempted to give severus a comforting smile but his lip curled in disgust as he caught sight of her lily expression faltered but she kept her face stony harry began to whimper again and she focused on soothing him instead severus please take a seat dumbledore invited gesturing towards an empty chair at his side the headmaster seemed quite unaware of the open mouthed gaping surrounding them instead he began to speak pleasently as though they were all guests of a rather delightful picnic lunch now severus here though you dontneed to know details has agreed to spy for us on lord voldemort most people flinched or screamed it is a dangerous task but is invaluable he announced calmly many people gave snorts of incredulity or doubt but he ignored them so that it alice asked looking positively dumb struck that the reason for the meeting yes dumbledore answered i thought you best be aware of it as soon as possible we must all be aware of the events taking place around us if we are to work as a team right alice muttered looking thoroughly unconvinced dumbledore paid no attenton to it but spread his arms apart and now you should all be off i sure warm beds are awaiting you eagerly in your homes as the others hurriedly got up to leave shooting snape malevont glances as they passed lily approached dumbledore tentatively i dontsuppose you ve caught wind of callidora she asked trying to keep the sadness out of her tone dumbledore shook his head sympathetically i afraid not lily you ll be the first to know if i do however he assured her lily bowed her head there really not a chance of her still being alive is there she asked dejectedly there is always hope dumbledore told her gently lily forced a smile and turned to leave she remus sirius james and the longbottom were the only people left now but then a second glance showed that peter had arrived certainly looking quite ill did i miss the meeting he squeaked yes you dolt sirius said in exasperation but nevertheless he began filling him in peter looked more astonished then anything but didntsay anything much excuse me would the rest of you linger behind a moment alice and frank you two can leave however i sure you ve got much to do tomorrow and you ll need your rest dumbledore asked as they all prepared to leave lily felt a lurch of suspiscion and surprise inside her but nodded and sat back down beside james alice looked mildly affronted but left with frank and neville nevertheless dumbledore walked the family to the door before returning to the now almost silent room i am afraid severus snape is not the only reason i called a meeting tonight he said gravely oh lily said softly james laid a comforting hand on her arm while remus and sirius looked on grimly peter was sniffling from his affliction but listened all the same you ll remember lily when you told the order about your research discoveries of course lily answered promptly well i have enlisted the help of mr filius flitwick into the more thorough use of the fideler ritual and we have discovered a way to use it on wizards and witches dumbledore explained lily green eyes lit up triumphantly that excellent it certainly is useful dumbledore replied sounding somewhat unenthused i afraid though we will have to put it into immediate practice what james asked slowly thinking hard his brow furrowed with worry why dumbledore sighed and got to his feet he began pacing and spoke in a hurried voice as though the quicker he spilt the information the easier it would be to accept a while back in years previous i witnessed a prophecy being made remus and lily gasped consecutively the prophecy stated that a child would be born to parents who had thrice defied voldemort peter cowered and would be born in late july it also went on to say that this child would have power to rid the world of voldemort lily felt a numb sortof fear gripping her she instinctively clutched harry tighter and hardly felt james hand grasp hers i have recieved word that voldemort has discovered the prophecy by dumbledore hesitated eyeing sirius and james apprehensively well by some means he has interpreted it and vowed to destroy that child lily felt tears spring to her eyes and it harry she asked in a choked voice dumbledore gaze her a sympathetic glance i afraid that is who he has chosen to go after he said gravely lily couldnthelp it strong as she wanted to be the tears just came pouring down her face bleeding sadness and fear chose remus asked dumb struck for james had a blank expression on his face and looked completely numb to say anything at all yes dumbledore said sadly neville longbottom could have been the other child nobody said anything and for a moment the only noise was lily sobs suddenly james let out a strangled noise and stormed out of the room sirius immediatly got up to follow him lily forced herself using every bit of her willpower to stop crying she looked fiercly at dumbledore but there things we can do isntthere things we can do to protect harry of course dumbledore agreed the fidelius charm we have invented as a result of the fideler ritual will hide you from everyone except the secret keeper lily nodded are you going to be secret keeper she asked breathlessly i afraid not it would be far too predicatable dumbledore said gravely you will have to choose someone else trustworthy i ll go and get sirius and james remus said seriously they need to hear this he left the room abruptly leaving lily to sit there rocking harry in her arms as she let the shock overwhelm her peter was also quite expressionless his eyes were so blank that if she didntknow better she would have thought a dementor had sucked out his soul for the first time in all living memory lily noted that even dumbledore looked numb beyong belief why harry why her child the fidelius charm james demanded questioningly as he re entered the room sirius and remus on his heel lily was struck painfully by his red rimmed eyes this will prevent voldemort from knowing are whereabouts yes dumbledore answered patiently it only a matter of choosing a secret keeper now sirius james said automatically if you re willing he added sirius nodded a determined expression in his dark eyes lily he asked i promise i would never betray you you re the only family i ve ever had lily gazed into his eyes so alit with fury and love and nodded yes excellent dumbledore said i ll inform the others you have left for hiding they will not be able to visit you i sorry remus peter sirius you may visit them but you will have to be cautious voldemort will be planning an attack soon and it wontbe long before he figures out what we have done sirius i need to you to be extra careful right sirius said with a nod not an ounce of fear seemed to marr his bold courage lily knew they couldnthave chosen anyone better for the job now for the charm dumbledore said lightly we ll have to head to your place to apply it everyone nodded solemnly and lily felt as though her heart were breaking how long would they have to stay in hiding how long before they saw their friends again goodbye prongs lily remus said embracing them both he looked at them sadness radiated from his blue eyes goodluck he took harry little hand in his own and gazed at the baby unable to believe what this child had been destined to do and you too harry remus then turned to leave abruptly so that the others would not see the tears that were beginning to form bye wormtail james said to peter who had remained looking extremely uncomfertable the short wizard did not say anything but allowed james and lily to give him a quick one armed hug before hurrying off ready dumbledore asked gently when only they and sirius remained james shrugged and followed dumbledore with the rest of them as the made their way back onto the streets why did fate have so that they must hide from what they had been fighting why had this burden been placed upon them 000 sirius arrived back at home an hour later completely woe begone and exhausted how cruel life was lily and james had been the most deserving people of a good life and now their very son was hunted by the darkest wizard of all time childishly he thought life was so unfair sirius came a soft voice from the living room sirius jumped about a foot into the air drawing his wand in the meanwhile cadence stepped into the dim hallway and surveyed her boyfriend are you okay she whispered looking quite concerned sirius didntknow what to say or if he should say anything at all sirius cadence pressed at that moment sirius felt the pressure of his responsibility and the tradgedy of it all fall upon him as the emotion engulfed him he let cadence lead him gently to the sofa what happened cadence asked comforting him as he struggled to fight back the tide of sadness that had barraged him and knowing he had to get it off his chest and at least tell somebody sirius told her everything she was lily friend she would understand she would feel the pain as he had oh sirius cadence whispered tearfully when he had finished telling her poor lily and james and harry it terrible she and sirius sat still in an embrace thinking of the darkness that had found it way into their life she felt unbearably proud of sirius for his role as secret keeper and still terribly sad for her friends gravely she realized that only luck and love could help them now 000 after putting harry to bed in his crib lily walked backed into the bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed lost in her thoughts for a long time she simply sat there like that not crying not worrying not even planning just sitting seconds passed minutes passed maybe even hours she didntknow how long it was until she found james arms around her and then in an instant she was crying her heart out onto his shoulder even as lily let bled her soul out james shoulders shook from his own tears he rarely cried had rarely felt the need too and yet here he was unable to stop the tears from pouring down his cheeks why couldntvoldemort have gone after him instead why did he have to set his evil desire on lily and harry too they were his entire life all his love he couldntlet anything harm them and yet here he was almost powerless he was scared no terrified for the first time in his life as the night progressed nothing changing sleep finally fell upon them still dressed yet holding each other tight they lay upon the blankets eyes closed hearts aching as she slept lily felt something surface in her dreams the words were hazy in her subconcious but the feeling clear love and renewed strength seemed to flow through her veins as the ancient magic soothed her with surprising suddeness lily snapped awake instantly awake she knew what she had to do she knew how to protect her son getting to her feet silently she hurried to harry room and removed the malachite chain she had put around his neck weeks earlier for days and days she had researched methods of making a reverse horcrux but it had seemed impossible now lily took off her amber ring and set it beside the malachite pendant ignoring the chill that ran up her spine as she whispered the charm lily cursed her ring so that in the event of her death it would become a horcrux she knew that because it would be her death and the amber soul cleansing properties that her spirit would remain whole and unlike a real horcrux she then turned to the malachite pendant and whispered the words that had echoed throughout her dreams she whispered the words of the ancient love spell she had read months earlier in the hogwarts library with a smile lily set the chain back around harry sleeping neck and slipped her ring back on her finger purpose achieved she ambled back to bed and curled up beside james whatever happened now she would always be with her son author note whew glad to get this chapter finished this was incredibly hard to write and i really dontknow whether i ll be able to survive writing the next i mean it is the chapter that made the legend that next right curse writing and it creation of emotional bonds with fictional characters anyhow comments would be much appreciated i reckon there will only be two or three more chapters left to this story oh and i shall plead again please check out the forum for this story please until next time before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 41 i will always love you dawn broke serene and peaceful that day october thirty first as the sweet daylight poured through the window illuminating the room lily gently slid out of james loving embrace from down the hallway the beginnings of a baby crying floated to her ears as though a pleasent melody everyday since that fateful meeting she had awoken each morning praying for that sound to reach her ears cherishing the song of life it sang morning harry lily cooed to her son as she tenderly removed him from his crib and held him over her heart harry crying ceased immediatly as he basked in his mother warm glow of affection gently lily fingered the malachite pendant around her son neck even as she gazed at her child she could see that harry eyes were beginning to change in colour already they were a shade of green to rival the malachite he had inherited her eyes joy blossomed inside of her mumma harry mumbled lily smiled fondly at her little one and carried him downstairs ready to begin just another day 000 sirius sat perched on the windowsill resembling a statue with his unusual stillness his eyes were bloodshot and his usually well groomed hair was in a disarray he had sat awake all night staring out the window praying for a dawn to precede the darkness every night he worried would bring the death eaters to his home and while he knew he would rather die then betray his friends he couldnthelp but wonder whether voldemort would allow him that blessing he was sure that the dark lord had the means to force his secret from his mouth sirius asked a tentative and concerned voice from behind him sirius made no movement to see who it was although he had urged her to stay away cadence had all the stubborness of the hippogriffs she raised to add to his worry for lily and james he was concerned that the death eaters would use cadence to make him reveal the potter location he wasntsure what he would do in that case and he hoped with every fibre of his soul that it wouldntcome down to that sirius the voice came again more insistant more bold with a barely audible sigh sirius turned to meet her hazel eyed gaze have you slept at all she asked gently sirius didntanswer she could figure that one out for herself are you going to speak or am i supposed to have a one sided conversation cadence demanded giving up her tentative approach annoyance now blazed in her eyes sirius hardly noticed he was focusing on not passing out on the floor at her feet hmpf cadence huffed when still he made no attempt to answer look sirius i understand you re worried i am too but depriving yourself of sleep is not going to help lily and james do you think that putting yourself on the brink of exhaustion is going to save harry cadence asked angrily you need your strength in case the death eaters do come knocking oh shut up sirius snapped hoarsely you dontknow what you re talking about cadence flinched at his coldness but she refused to give in to his stubborness what donti understand she asked half eager half irritated maybe i would if you d just talk to me you haventwanted to see me since the night of the meeting i dontwant you to understand sirius snapped in reply and you re right i dontwant to see mostly because i dontwant to see you dead sirius you re over reacting cadence informed him furiously you know who doesnteven know you re the secret keeper it possible he doesnteven know about the fidelius spell yet oh he ll know sirius said bitterly and i so close to james how long untl he suspects i the one guarding their whereabouts cadence hesitated at this point knowing that what he said was true well maybe you ought to go into hiding too she suggested uncertainly sirius laughed roughly no the fidelius charm is cancelled if the secret keeper is under the same spell if only we knew someone who isntwell known for being connected to james or lily cadence raised an eyebrow and sirus felt as though a brick has slammed into his face peter he muttered dumb struck pardon me cadence asked clearly not understanding peter sirius exclaimed why didnti think of it before no one would ever suspect that james and peter are good friends but he s so so well i dunno i dontthink that a good idea cadence faltered looking quite bewildered sirius gave her a cool look peter is my friend he reminded her flatly cadence hesitated but well he not exactly brave or good at resisting pressure see you dontunderstand sirius exclaimed angrily peter is a gryffindor and i ve known him since almost forever no one would ever suspect him while i d be so much the easier target cadence felt a wave of fury hit her maybe it you who doesntunderstand she burst out what are you a coward chickening out of your responsibility your promise to your friends sirius winced and cadence thought dimly that she may have stepped over the line but before she could apologize sirius had his wand out i am not a coward he roared pain blazing in his eyes i just want my friends to live and i think peter is there best chance if you dontwant them to have the best hope they can get then fine but i ll ask you to leave me alone sirius shouted with every emotion he d been feeling for the few days he let his remorse fear desire for cadence to distance herself from him for her saftey and everything else to escape now cadence looked shocked at his pronouncement i i just t thought she stuttered but sirius silenced her leave me alone cady he muttered cadence looked torn between anger and hurt if i not worthy to stand beside you even at the hands of death then this relationship is over she informed him her voice steely and her expression stony sirius gave her a long searching look if that what it costs to keep you safe then fine by me cadence opened her mouth to say something else but changed her mind and stormed from the room as she left she called out and sirius black you had better not give that responsibility to peter or so help me god you will have to deal with me sirius shook his head angrily as the door slammed downstairs she didntknow what she was talking about they trusted peter 000 sirius sat across the table from james eating sandwiches that lily had made for the two of them she herself was spooning rather mushy baby food into harry eager mouth while the two men talked sorry to hear that mate james said after listening to sirius rave on about his and cadence breakup lily didntsay anything but sirius knew she was listening by the way her eyes were slightly narrowed i expect you think i the one at fault do you he asked wearily throwing his question at lily she raised an eyebrow at him not necessarily she replied i just find it odd that she d break up with you for no reason who said she broke up with me sirius asked indignantly lily snorted seriously sirius his only response was to roll his eyes so the reason lily pressed well the same reason i ve come actually sirius mumbled unsure how to phrase what he wanted to say he didntwant lily and james to be offended or think he was too cowardly to fufill his role oh james and lily inquired together sirius found himself distracted at how perfect they were together like they could read each other mind he shook his head to clear it and hurriedly voice his concerns i think you should change the secret keeper to peter lily frowned james looked surprised and even harry greenish eyes opened wide with astonishment oh dontlook at me like that sirius muttered to his godson harry merely gurgled in response why lily finally asked breaking the brief silence sirius glanced down at his hands hesitantly it not that i afraid i want you to know that i would die rather then betray you he began but i fear that voldemort will expect me to be secret keeper and force the informaton out of me somehow peter so much less of a target no one would ever suspect him i see james answered looking thoughtful he exchanged a glance with lily who shrugged you have a point she said gently and if you re sure then we ll change to peter sirius felt relief wash over him glad they understood if peter willing i think it would be safer for you he said in response james nodded you ll have to go switch the spell only you can do it now he informed his friend sirius nodded and jumped to his feet i ll go do it now the sooner the better thanks for understanding thanks for your concern lily replied with a light smile sirius winked at her right then i off and do you know what i reckon you can all make it through this i hope so padfoot james grinned i hope so 000 what news have you wormtail voldemort asked irritibly his red eyes gleamed with an even more intense fury then usual the potter had vanished and what was more he couldntreach them because of an ancient magic they had invoked it infuriated him to no end and he had cursed peter endlessly for his inability to prevent it come to tell me you ve ruined yet another of the dark lord plans i should kill you were you stand he hissed angrily peter cowered as he shadowed the entrance to the room they were in no my lord peter squeaked getting to his knees and kissing the hem of voldemort dark robes i bring good news voldemort searched the wizards pathetic eyes for the news he carried too impatient to wait for the man to bumble on about it as the truth was revealed to him voldemort felt renewed delight and fury surge inside him peter had been made secret keeper it seems you are not as incapable as you pretend wormtail voldemort hissed his red eyes dancing malevolently who was i to think it was you who betrayed me into telling dumbledore my plans you have my gratitude thank you my lord peter said kissing the hem of his robes again you are most worthy most be quiet voldemort demanded peter immediatly fell silent voldemort removed his wand from a pocket and held it in his long pale fingers he flexed his fist as though testing it readiness grab a cloak wormtail i think it time we paid the potters a visit and he laughed then cold and cruel anticipating the events that would take place that night no child could stand the wrath of lord voldemort 000 james lily called as she walked slowly down the stairs having just put harry to bed he looked up from where he was sitting on the sofa apparantly having been lost in thought just a moment before yes love he asked do you think it was wise to let sirius switch secret keeper with peter she said down beside him and wrung her hands nervously it just i have an awful feeling about it james took her hands in his and kissed her softly on the cheek i sure it just nerves and we can trust peter sirius is right he probably a safer choice then himself james assured her lily laid her head on his shoulder i suppose she whispered i just hate being so helpess there a war going on outside these walls and we cantdo a thing about it but we already have lily james reminded her gently our child has been prophesized to bring an end to it all lily felt tears fill in her eyes and she wiped them away hastily but why harry she asked sadly silence settled upon them she and james had already been over this dozens of times before there was really nothing left to be said for awhile the young couple just sat there in each others arms relishing in each other comfort as minutes passed james kissed lily tenderly and she responded in all the recent events of evil they had not had but a moment to themselves as lily slid her arms around james neck and drew him closer she wondered whether it was possible to be even more in love it was a feeling that in all her years of being with him she had not been able to quite grasp she wanted to spend the rest of her life coming to terms with it james slipped his arms around lily and picked her up still immersed in the deepest of kisses he carried her upstairs for almost all his life she was everything he had ever wanted now being married and having a son he knew without a doubt that she was everything he ever needed he set her down gently on the bed and pulled away for a moment to gaze into her passion filled gaze her green eyes sparkled with everything that made his life worthwhile he sighed in contentment my heart is yours lily potter he said caught in the moment realizing just how deeply in love he was oh james lily sighed contemplating his face we re already in heaven dontsay things like that james said gently not wanting to be reminded of all the danger around them lily kissed him softly sorry i just mean well i with you always she told him not even sure how to phrase what she was feeling i will always love you james told her lily searched the depths of his eyes a moment longer before answering and i you she whispered james leaned in and engaged her in a kiss filled with bit of passion warmth and love he possessed then quite suddenly the security alarm went off damn sirius james cursed as untangling himself from lily embrace he collected his wand to turn it off or maybe it peter he flicked his wand and the familiar monotone voice read peter pettigrew james rolled his eyes and unindentified wizard unindenitified lily asked in bewilderment james shrugged probably sirius in animagus form that what happened last time remember lily nodded i ll wait for you here then i sure he wontbe long she smiled at james who returned it not knowing that would be the last time they shared such an exchange lily waited patiently playing with her amber ring and listening to james hurry down the stairs a few moments of silence passed and she heard the door creak open very distantly she heard the exchange of voices and felt that something was wrong just as she was getting to her feet james shouted in a strangled voice lily it him take harry and run for a moment lily froze viridian eyes widening as her stomach felt as though it were being filled with molten panic in that one second she felt her world fall down upon her her heart shatter and her love for her only sonseize control of her actions in a blind panic she streaked to the baby room not daring to glance down the staircase to what she knew but refused to believewas there colloportus lily gasped slamming the door shut behind her then without thinking she applied a strong locking spell she had learnt in her previous auror training still shocked she stood paralyzed straining her ears to listen for noise she really didntwant to hear without thought emotion or anything she listened as a high cold voice pronounced spells and a stronger bolder one countered them then without warning she heard the higher voice shout one last thing with such finality lily felt something inside herself die as a dull thud announced the fall of a body lily covered her mouth and bit back a sob james she thought feeling as if she was dying right then and there fortunately harry whimper brought her back to reality harry she sobbed her voice overflowing with pain she hurried to the crib and reached down to grab him when a deafening bang sounded behind her lily stumbled to the floor from the force but immediatly regained her footing and turned to meet the very thing that had plagued her nightmares red eyes as demonic and searing as the last time she had gazed into them lily had expected this but not the insurmountable fury she felt well up inside her at the sight of her husband murderer looking at lord voldemort was like staring your worst fear in the face embracing the agony of those lost and self inflicting the pain he had caused he was the very definition of fear and yet as lily stared him down furiously all she could feel was courage get out of the way voldemort demanded his voice merciless and colder then she could have imagined no lily said weakly not harry no step out of the way you silly girl voldemort hissed stepping forward and trying to push her aside lily refused to budge no please no not harry kill me kill me instead she cried desperately please voldemort held his wand and aimed it towards her heart his rage building get out of the way he said in a voice that indicated finality impatience the ending of things lily remembered james and felt her courage strengthen ten fold no she repeated calming herself still shielding a now crying harry as best she could while trying to stand tall and defiant voldemort lip curled and his red eyes blazed avada kedavra he yelled blinding green light filled her vision and an odd rushing sound filled her ears even as her lifeless form crumpled towards the ground lily recalled james words to her and subconciously directed them to harry i will always love you author note well here we have it i really donteven reallyknow what to say the emotions writing this chapter were unbelievable and i really

the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 42 left behind voldemort laughed mercilessly as the lifeless body of the mudblood crumpled to the ground at his feet he was so preoccupied by his achievement that he didntnotice the glow of light in his victim amber ring before it shot a small frail jet of light out towards the baby malachite pendant reliving his success voldemort completely ignored the glow that briefly surrounded the child such a foolish woman for thinking she could stand up to the greatest wizard of all time voldemort thought in the hallway behind him peter hovered anxiously torn between the agony of watching his friends die and eagerness to see his master prevail lord voldemort success could only mean an increase in power for himself well now harry voldemort hissed cruelly i ve been wanted to meet you for a very long time now the toddler gazed up at the hooded man screaming and wailing in terror in fright he stretched out his short arms towards lily body desperately trying to get her to comfort him voldemort laughed with mirth at the very sight she neednthave died you know the wizard continued his voice laced with malice it would have given me great pleasure to know her suffering from losing her family harry continued to scream his cries growing both in volume and pitch voldemort was getting impatient almost lazily he raised his wand dumbledore was a fool for thinking you could put an end to my regime voldemort said thoughtfully his red eyes gleamed with excitement where are your powers now laughing again voldemort pointed his wand at the sobbing child avada kedavra he bellowed prounouncing every syllable with relish harry crying ceased immedialty to see the jet of bright green light come straight at him voldemort grinned evilly as the spell struck the child harry let out a wail as the curse hit him and a searing pain burnt across his forehead before passing out at almost exactly the same moment the malachite pendant hanging over harry chest heated up to an unbearable temperature as it absorbed the avada kedavra glowing brightly emerald the pendant remained like that for a moment before splitting in two and sending the curse back upon it caster even as the two broken pieces of stone bounced to the floor voldemort terrible shriek filled the room filling the room with a blinding and horribly powerful red energy force the windows shattered and the roof cracked peter had a fleeting glimpse of his master terrible red eyes before his entire body was reduced to vapour shuddering in fright peter watched as the smoke was whisked out the room he couldntbe no it was impossible positively shaking in fear peter tentatively moved into the room which seemed due to collpase at any moment avoiding the sight of both lily and harry lifeless bodies absolute shock gripped him to realize that he had just witnessed his master death where now was the reward peter had sought what could he do the potter were dead and yet so was his master how could a mere child have had such an effect with morbid curiosity peter inched over to the crib and gazed down at the baby he presumed dead baby harry lay motionless atop his blankets his complexion pale however the most curious thing stood out against his pale skin a lightening bolt shaped cut had appeared on the toddler marking him peter stared at in wonder before shaking out of his stupor as a large chunk of ceiling crashed to the ground he musntlose his nerve as little as he had bending down peter saw one of the halves of the malachite stone harry had been wearing this must have been what had saved harry peter thought dimly pocketing the find maybe it still retained it protective properties peter made to scurry from the room when a last thought struck him there lying on the floor was voldemort old wand perhaps it too retained it previous owner power quickly making up his mind he pocketed that too just as he exited the room in a panicked hurry the nursery walls seemed to give out crashing down across the corpses with another chilling shiver peter darted down the stairs keeping his head firmly up so as not to see james bloodied body sprawled across the floor peter streaked out into the cool night air breathing hard to keep himself calm sirius black would know exactly what had happened peter told himself blind with terror he had to hide sirius was the only one who knew that he was secret keeper had been secret keeper peter reminded himself dully he would have to go on the run keep himself away for fear of his life perhaps he d drop the half pendant and voldemort wand at his secret place yes that would be a good idea peter decided that way if he ever needed to retrieve them they would be ready and waiting a loud crashing sound broke peter concentration darting a glance at the small cottage he realized that it was slowly collapsing upon itself voldemort death really had been powerful peter took a deep breath preparing for what he must do turning around he made to flee but then a last minute idea occured to him morsmordre peter whimpered aiming his wand skyward instantly a mess of green and grey smoke was issued from his wand and hovered to a place above the wrecked building he let his watery blue eyes focus on it for only an instant before running beyond the wards and disapparating what had he done 000 dumbledore sat wearily at his office desk reading over the latest papers the ministry had sent them the documents issued for his opinion contained mostly the names of suspected death eaters all of whom dumbledore severely doubted were authentic at fawke soft chirruping dumbledore finally raised his head to see what had caught the phoenix rapt attention it was apparant immediatly what the issue was dumbledore steepled his fingers and waited paitently as a top ranked auror stepped out of the whirling green flames inside his fire place dumbledore felt a jolt of concern immediatly as he took in the man known as rufus scrimgeour s appearence scrimgeour was looking as though he had run miles and had a look of utmost grief and frustration on his face rufus dumbledore said inclining his head politely he gestured at the chair facing his desk but scrimgeour refused breathlessly no thanks dumbledore he panted urgent business the ministry needs your help what happened dumbledore asked finally letting the alarm he felt seep into his ancient voice scrimgeour bowed his head grimly i afraid it another death eater attack he said regaining his composure we ve been getting numerous calls reporting the dark mark hanging in the sky somewhere north east of here but nobody seems to be able to reveal it whereabouts i think this place whatever ever it is must have been made unplottable dumbledore glasses flashed alarmingly northeast that couldntbe godric hollow could it thank you rufus tell the minister i will be at the ministry immediatly i just need a moment to prepare and gather my thoughts dumbledore informed the grizzled auror before him scrimgeour gave him a strange look but complied nonetheless dumbledore waited until the emerald flames has whisked him away again before launching into action very quickly he sent out a patronus urging rubeus hagrid to report immediatly to his office composed and intelligent as he may have been nothing could have prepared dumbledore for what was happening willing himself to check his suspiscions dumbledore quickly apparated using his superior powers to overcome the hogwarts magic which should have prevented it to where sirius had informed his the potter lived his head bowed gravely at the sight of the ruined house with the dark mark hanging eeriely overtop it glancing at a watch with many hands and which looked imcomprehensible to anyone but him he checked the time good he still had a few minutes before hagrid would arrive at his office he knew that the half giant would be asleep in his hut wearied by the halloween festivites with long purposeful strides while still mentally preparing himself dumbledore entered the potter ruined home almost immediatly he encountred the corpse of james potter with a reluctant appraising gaze dumbledore made sure that the man was truly dead before moving on after searching the downstairs hastily he hurried upstairs to the nursery it was worse then he had expected the room was in ruins the walls were charred as though burnt and the roof had given out in some places lily potter body too gave it a most forbidding atmosphere closing his eyes momentarily overcome with sadness and horror dumbledore stepped over the dead woman body and examined their child he was quite unprepared for what happened next harry eyelids flickered open revealing eyes that had certainly not been that green before the baby whimpered and stretched out his arms and dumbledore tentatively removed the child from his crib harry dumbledore whispered in incredulity how how is this possible knowing that it was impossible to expect the child to answer dumbledore carried him to the sitting room carefully shielding his deceased father from view he set the child down on the sofa and quickly thought out a plan immensely curious dumbledore launched another patronus requesting that hagrid wait for him in his office he had to find out what had happened before he could decide what to do legilimens he muttered fixing harry viridian eyes with his soft blue ones as dumbledore sifted through the child memories it became clear to him what had happened although he was shocked beyond belief he knew that swift action was required for one he did not believe voldemort had truly died for second sirius must have betrayed the potter s and there was no way in telling when he may show up to finish the job if that was the case dumbledore found himself surprised to find that he had tears in his eyes the potter death had affected him greatly they had been two of the most talented and loving people he had ever known it was cruel that fate had chosen this path for them and even crueller for harry who had been left behind dumbledore straightened to his feet deciding what he must do he quickly cast a charm over the house so that sirius black would be denied entrance it was a powerful charm but would only last until harry was removed from the house dumbledore would have taken harry with him if it were not for the fact that the ministry was expecting him no hagrid would be more then capable of rescuing the child besides dumbledore had to arrange something for harry future i will see you soon harry dumbledore whispered to the child as he left the house and apparated back to hogwarts as dumbledore arrived back in his office he quickly explained the circumstances to a shocked hagrid only after telling him that his help was required did dumbledore succeed in calming the man down hagrid readily took a sheet of paper sirius had left with dumbledore ages ago in case of such an emergency it had the potter address on it hagrid quickly memorized it before heading out to do his duty he would take a thestral to the village of godric hollow dumbledore then proceeded to the ministry of magic and explained to them that voldemort had been vanquished for the moment much to his annoyance the minister seemed more overjoyed then saddened at the incident he gone he cried joyously to the rest of the ministry only once dumbledore had dragged him away to speak in private did the man utter well surely you can take care of all that dumbledore the aurors will deal with the arrests soon this is a time for celebration dumbledore was gravely irritated at the minister disconcern did he not understand about harry dumbledore sighed perhaps it was better if he looked after the child future the ministry certainly wasntconcerned knowing full well that hagrid would take the child to headquarters after acquiring him dumbledore prepared himself to greet the morning and a day overwhelemed with stress and planning 000 sirius was awoken by the loud sounds of cheering and explosions at three in the morning grumbling angrily he got dressed and stepped outside to see what was going on he was not quite prepared for the barrage of smiling that met his appearence what going on sirius asked in bewilderment not able to understand why a large group of wizards had huddled on the corner of the street setting off dr fillibuster fireworks are you mad the muggles will see he hissed in impatience dedalus diggle giggled furiously but we must celebrate you know who has been vanquished he exclaimed looking immensely satisfied at the look of shock on sirius weary face we ve just been informed by the ministry he gone impossible sirius hissed feeling extremely confused dedalus diggle smile faltered momentarily they say that a mere boy stopped him he whispered in a more serious tone but within a second his face was lit up again with the same previous jubialance it had shown before to harry potter he cried raising a bottle of firewhiskey sirius blanked at the name and felt horror seize his heart no 000 hagrid couldntstop the sobs that had engulfed him as he entered the potter ruined home true to dumbledore word he had burnt the paper with the address after reading it and had immediatly headed straight for godric hollow even though everything had already been explained he still couldntquite come to terms with all that had happened it was too terrible never mind the dark lord disappearance the price was too great at the sight of the bodies hagrid crying increased violently teardrops the size of quarters rained from his face and sprinkled across the floor as he took in the apperence of broken items and destroyed furniture hagrid eyes blurrily scanned over harry sobbing form on the couch he hastened over the little baby at once poor little tyke hagrid sobbed wrapping harry in a blanket that had been lying atop the couch his large hands handled the child with a rough but comforting touch harry crying diminished to sniffling as he gaze wide eyed at the giant come on arry hagrid grunted forcing himself to stop sobbing let get yeh outta ere with large shuffling steps hagrid carried harry out into the autumn air he stopped in shock as he spotted another wizard waiting outside growling in frustration sirius cursing at not being let inside ceased immediatly at the sight of harry hagrid sirius gasped hoarsely his face both pale and tear stained ello sirius hagrid said soberly in his grief quite forgetting what dumbledore had said about sirius having been secret keeper an awkward silence fell between them nobody quite knew how to express their agony can i see him sirius whispered almost inaudibly hagrid shrugged and passed the bundle just sightly larger then his hand to sirius sirius held harry close as the child whimpered padfud harry said fighting back a wave a tears sirius quickly passed harry back to hagrid you re taking him to dumbledore he asked trying to prevent his heart from shattering that righ hagrid agreed tearfully sirius nodded letting his dark hair fall over his dark eyes take this he said gesturing to his over sized flying motorcycle it charmed so muggle cantsee it i couldn t hagrid began but sirius shook his head violently take it he exclaimed his voice cracking in pain i need to know my godson is safe hagrid contemplated this a moment before agreeing with a solemn thanks he took harry and mounted the motorcycle sirius watched roughly as the vehicle became airborne and took off into the dawn then with a deep breath sirius readied himself for a final farewell before taking off for what he was going to do peter was going to wish he had never been born 000 peter crept anxiously through the muggle streets of london keen to avoid sirius detection he wondered if his ex friend would alert the others of his treachery and the switch of responsibilites the very thought of this paralyzed him with fear shaking it off peter continued to walk dimly aware of the whispers around him it seemed that the world had become aware of voldemort demise he thought fearfully peter had just returned from hiding voldemort wand and the half pendant he did not want them to be found as peter flighty steps carried him past an alleyway a low growl made his heart stop dead a sweat broke out immediatly as he turned to gaze into the darkness of the alleyway there lowering himself into a position to lunge was the animagus form of padfoot no peter shrieked in terror diving into a crowd of muggles the people around him gazed at his flight in mingled confusion before adding their screaming to the din the shaggy black dog had just transformed into a man sirius strode purposefully through the crowds ignoring the screams that accompanied him ahead of him peter was getting ready to apparate sirius was determined not to give him that chance crazed with agony and fury sirius shot a spell at peter forcing him to fight back peter was positively shaking with fear as he pressed himself up against the wall of a muggle shopping mall how could you sirius bellowed pain forming his words you lowly no good coward n n n n o pl please sirius peter begged desperately avoiding the man furious dark eyed glare i d d didntm m m ean t to sirius laughed sounding almost insane every bit of laughter rang with derisiveness sorry sirius asked dangerously his voice lowering to a whisper you betrayed them you betrayed them all look what you ve done lily james sirius voice broke as the fresh pain broke over him harry peter remained silent afraid that movement might set sirius anger off again it however came anyways i should kill you sirius bellowed and though it was plain to see that he couldntreally do it peter knew he would be badly hurt and made to suffer reducto sirius screamed sending a spell peter way peter ducked and the hex hit the wall of the building causing it to explode as rubble rained down upon them peter seized his chance non verbally he sent a colourless spell towards the muggles as sirius sent off another curse in his rage as sirius spell again missed peter hit it target terrorized screams of horror and pain echoed from the crowd of muggles as an immense explosion rocked the street sirius went flying back into the brick wall from the force as dust from the damage rose into the air and blocked him from view peter shut his eyes firmly pointed his wand at his finger and whispered diffindo fighting back a pained scream at losing his finger he focused the rest of his energies into one sole goal as sirius lunged through the smoke desperately searching for peter the wizard he sought transfigured himself to a rat sirius watched in horror as the rodent scurried away under the rubble just as sirius raised his wand to summon the coward he was caught from behind by a stunning spell as conciousness faded sirius gazed back defiantly at the auror that had stunned him they had come for him unaware that he was innocent and their real quarry was escaping under their very noses 000 frank held alice close as she sobbed onto his shoulder neville clutched tight in her arms it was november second two days since the potters had been murdered and voldemort vanquished it should have been a joyous occasion but alice very heart was bleeding for the loss of her friend they had heard rumours about it yesterday of course but it was only when dumbledore had come to see them that morning that they had finally accepted the truth what about harry frank asked sadly still comforting his hysterical wife dumbledore sighed he is with his only remaining relatives now they will provide for him a protection no other family can he explained wearily dumbledore had not slept in almost forty eight hours the ministry and harry had kept him tied up until now and even yet his presence was required this afternoon to send sirius black to azkaban the aurors had caught him only the previous day after he had murdered an entire streetful of muggles and long time friend peter pettigrew it had been said that black had murdered the man for trying to forewarn the potter s dumbledore didntwant to believe it though he had to accept it as true he had known for ages that their had been a spy amongst the order though never had he believed it would have been sirius i cantbelieve it sirius black they were best mates frank whispered still numb from shock it was as though he had sensed what dumbledore had been thinking again dumbledore sighed we must believe it i never would have believed it myself but i have seen the evidence dumbledore answered tonelessly and what of you know who alice asked suddenly speaking for the first time surely harry couldnthave defeated him her voice quivered and she couldntfight back her hiccoughs yet she waited for dumbledore reply without breaking down again that even i do not know i was hoping you could tell me some of the protection means the potters had invoked dumbledore sighed alice and frank shook their heads lily had given harry a protective amulet but it was no different then the dozen others there are as far as i know alice replied thoughtfully silent tears pouring down her face again i suppose we may never know dumbledore said in resignaton he had gone to investigate the potter residence yesterday again after everything had been settled and harry had been placed with the dursleys his search had revealed nothing also it appeared the fidelius charm had finally worn off with peter death dumbledore had been sure to replace wards of his own this time casting a spell that only one with potter blood could re enter the building this way harry could return to his old home exactly as it was when he was ready so what now dumbledore frank asked solemnly dumbledore eyed frank sadly now we try and keep harry alive voldemort is not gone forever he explained frank bowed his head while alice burst into tears again even little neville seemed to be more subdued then usual dumbledore left the small family to mourn not knowing that he would have even more to mourn about soon author note well here you have it i hope it didntseem too rushed and confusing i was trying to get all the important bits in while still trying to make it really emotional anyhow the next chapter is the last so please review you can count on an update soon oh and i going to post this one more time just to bug you all and hopefully encourage you to visit it but there isa forum for this story p yeah i know i annoying but please stop by if you have a moment before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic i also do not own poems do not stand by my grave and weep nor in memory by joyce kilmer chapter 43 fragments alice longbottom clutched neville closely to her as she stood silently sobbing underneath the weeping willow tears poured down her face unceasingly despite frank comforting arm around her shoulders even he had tears in his eyes as they stood there clad in black and unspeaking the last funeral alice had attended had been serena s and the wave of grief that this thought initiated added to their present agony made it seem as though the very world were ending the minister continued to drone on about the potter lives his voice carrying loudly across the peaceful meadow few had shown up to attend the potter funeral just outside godric hollow but then few had been able to attend sirius black had been convicted without trial for associating himself with voldemort and the death eaters he was also charged in revealing the potter location and therefore assisting in their murder it was unbelieavable and the wizarding world had been sent reeling at this news alice simply couldntdigest the news no matter how many times she was told how could sirius jame best friend and harry godfather so cruelly aid the dark lord in his vicious cavolts then again she supposed numbly sirius did hail from the well known dark family of black s but even so and then there was the case of peter pettigrew he had always been such a quiet timid boy alice thought drearily as the minister continued to ramble no one had ever paid him much attention he had often been neglected or left out and then to have the courage to try and warn his friends alice couldntbear the thought of his murder he alone had known and tried to help but sirius had killed him too there were almost a dozen witnesses both muggle and wizard who had saw the brutal way in which sirius ended peter and so many other lives it made alice sick to even think of it and so here they were the longbottom s remus and cadence mourning yet another loss first frank parents then serena then callidora and now all this how much more could they take how long until the rest of their lives were ended voldemort was gone that may have been so but dumbledore had assured them that he did not believe this was a permanent relief and besides their were still the death eaters to contend with alice bit back another sob as she thought of this lily and james they had always been so adamant in their attempts to help end the war and yet it still drew on despite their deaths how could life be so unfair as alice dissolved into a fresh set of sobs cadence own shouldes shook with her grief her skin was tinged grey and their were dark shadows under her eyes even her usually glossy hair hung dull and lank her heart was swimming with pain and her head buzzed with confusion her agony for lily james and harry was so deep she couldnteven shed a tear she was shocked beyond belief it seemed as though her entire body had shut down she hadnteaten since she had heard of the murders nor had she slept and even as her life seemingly stopped functioning her mind fought on contemplating all the events she knew deep down that they didntadd up how could they cadence sighed and leaned against the trunk of the tree that overshadowed the graves sirius had confided in her his plans to change secret keeper to peter and she couldnthelp but wonder whether he had done so or not she was almost one hundred percent confident that sirius had not been a double agent due to his lack of the dark mark his loving demeanor and his almost non existence absences cadence had been with him for almost every hour of the day when they were not working sirius would not have had the time to slip off and even then all this did not explain why sirius had murdered half a dozen muggles and his own friend why had sirius murdered peter had it been in rage maybe sirius had changed secret keepers and peter had been the turn coat cadence shook her head furiously trying to clear it she wasntmaking sense for one peter did not have the guts or brains to accomplice himself with you know who secondly it still did not excuse how sirius had taken all those innocent lives even if he had not been guilty of treachery he was surely responsible for the muggle deaths there was solid proof in that case cadence could not help but blame herself if only she had listened to sirius if only she had trusted him remus watched helplessly as his friend around him dealt with the pain of their loss alice and frank were devastated and cadence was a wreck he had seen pain in her eyes and yet an extra cloud seemed to overshadow it remus knew that she and sirius had shared special feelings but they had broken up before the incident could any of that had anything to do with sirius seemingly lack in reason or maybe he really just had been a traitor all along remus bit down on his tongue fighting tooth and nail to hide his emotions he was not ashamed for the other to see him cry or show emotion no he was scared of what might happen if he let himself be overcome with grief in less then a week remus had lost every one of his closest friends james sirius peter and himself he closed his eyes reminiscing their old school days as marauders their first day on the train oi grinned a dark haired boy as he poked his head inside the compartment and glanced around it eleven year old remus raised his head curiously from the book he had been reading yes he replied politely feeling slightly nervous it was his first encounter with what appeared to be a fellow first year and he wasntall to confident his appeareance was slightly wearied and woe begotten from the full moon that had just passed and his clothes were rather shabby and old to his great relief the other boy didntseem to mind mind if i join you he asked his dark eyes dancing merrily remus gave a small smile sure he agreed gesturing to the seat across from him the boy flashed him an ever broader grin of thanks before tugging his trunk in and hefting it atop the luggage rack he was already rather tall for his age sirius black the boy panted offering his hand as he slumped into the seat across from him remus shook it gladly remus lupin he replied pleased to meet you sirius smiled impishly at his response but did not say anything else for a moment the two boys stared across the small compartment at each other before succumbing to the awkward silence remus had just opened his book back up to the page he had left off at when another disturbance came from the hallway sod off malfoy a young boy voice shouted with clear anger remus and sirius exchanged curious looks before hurrying to peer out the compartment window another eleven year old from the looks of it with platinum blonde hair was scurrying off down the hallway while a messy black haired kid and short straw haired kid marched in the other direction coming towards their compartment for some reason sirius seemed to find this highly amusing with gleeful laughter he slid the door open and gave the taller kid a one armed hug james he exclaimed happily the dark haired kid james pushed his glasses further up his nose before replying in a somewhat disgruntled voice hullo sirius fancy seeing you here sirius just chuckled some more before ushering the two kids into the room he glanced apologetically at remus i hope you dontmind remus he said remus shook his head torn between amusement and confusion not at all great sirius said his mischievious twinkle returning to his eyes james this is remus lupin remus this is james potter my best mate since we were four remus exchanged greetings with the boy named james before turning to the last unnamed kid he seemed to shake with fear under remus kindly gaze and you are peter pettigrew james answered for him i rescued him from that git malfoy and his precous tag along snape pathetic they are bullying other kids already how d you rescue em sirius asked eagerly remus too felt rather curious although james too was tall for his age he did not seem to possess extrodinary muscle power just a little magic james replied casually remus and peter gaped at james while sirius gave him a clap on the back you know magic already remus practically croaked feeling somewhat diminished he knew that pureblooded wizards would probably have some advantage over the half bloods but he had not expected to be this far behind already james seemed to sense what he was thinking for he explained nothing big my dad had been coaching me on a few simple spells before i left for hogwarts but i couldntpractice them before obviously so i guess the theory was pretty good dontworry sirius added happily i dontknow a single bit of magic and i sure no one else does either james has always been a bit of a keener he tipped james a knowing wink to which james replied with a scowl oh shut up sirius he grumbled you know full well that not true and besides who was the one who was reading book after book on pranking spells after he got his letter i dontseem to recall you referring to us as keener then sirius retorted in within minutes the two boys argument had evolved into a full fledged wrestling tournament peter was oooh ing and ahh ing childishly as remus watched on what wrong with studying he asked mildly thinking self conciously of hogwarts a history he had been skimming over before sirius barged in james and sirius halted their tussle immediatly and gawked up at him from the floor nothing at all james said promptly while sirius grinned wickedly dontworry we ll forgive your little hobby he joked but you better know a thing or two about pranking i all out of ideas remus rolled his eyes at sirius despite the happiness he was feeling from making new friends james and sirius had just resumed their match in which sirius was struggling out of a half nelson when a new person slid the door to the compartment open they both froze again to encounter a rather shocked green eyed gaze oh um sorry the girl muttered embarressedly i ll just leave then she brushed her vivid red hair from her face and made to close her eyes but james called out wait er yes the girl replied looking rather bewildered what your name the girl flushed slightly pink but said smoothly lily evans cool sirius chipped in i sirius black this is james potter that remus lupin and that er peter pittengrance p p pettigrew peter corrected them shyly but nobody heard him right the girl named lily said awkwardly looking unsure how to act she shuffled her feet anxiously well bye she turned and strode off quickly down the hallway pulling her trunk behind her james stared after her an unreadable expression on his face it had been the beginning of it all remus inquired someone tearful voice remus jolted from his reverie to meet alice worried gaze he was surprised to see that the service had ended are you alright remus opened his mouth to answer but alice cut him off sounding rather distant no of course you re not sorry none of us are it just terrible she broke off as her usually bright brown eyes filled with tears again remus didntknow what to say he glanced helplessly at frank who was holding neville neither man met each other gaze unable to voice their emotions remus sighed it ll be alright alice he said kindly it will get better the pain it will go away eventually i mean yeah remus let his voice trail off awkwardly he had never been the best at comforting people and right now he wasnteven sure he was in a state too he was in shock to put it frankly neville gurgled happily in his father arms oblivious to his surroundings at his blissful unconcerned behaviour remus couldnthelp but think of harry how would the poor child be coping in an unfamiliar home with unfamiliar people remus shook his head sadly remembering lily hostility regarding her sister he couldnthelp but wonder how harry was being treated well frank said his deep voice sounding empty come on love augusta will take neville for a few hours so we can spend a little time adjusting alice followed her husband wordlessly tears streaming from her eyes yet again as remus glanced around at the remaining guests he noted that all of their faces were wet all except his what was wrong with him he had been one of the closest to the potters and yet he couldnteven shed a single tear for their loss remus clenched his fists in frustration and strode away from the graves as each step took his farther away from the plot he increased his speed feeling a building desire to get out of there finally he exited from the cemetary and continued to run down the street not even thinking to apparate all he wanted to do was run as far as he could as the tears finally burst free whipping into the wind remus knew he was running away from the truth 000 cadence stared mindlessly at the graves not even noticing she was the only person left her mind kept churning but she didntwant to think she didntwant to believe what had happened but most of all she didntwant to accept what her actions had caused had she only had half the mind to listen to sirius feelings she might have been able to to what even she didntknow but somehow she knew that if she had stayed with him she could have prevented this entire ordeal somehow impatiently cadence wiped the tears from her eyes and sank down onto light coating of snow that blanketed the ground she ignored the coldness that seeped through her robes instead choosing to focus on what had been engraved on lily and james shared headstone underneath their names and date of birth and death was a small verse from the poem in memory by joyce kilmer that james had requested in his will be placed upon it it read love voice is through your song above and under and in each note to echo and remain as cadence re read each line over and over she cried her heart out as each salty tear hit the snow it caused it to melt leaving cadence dripping wet evening was beginning to settle upon her and the temperature was dropping only when the moisture on her cheeks began to freeze did cadence finally admit defeat shakily she struggled to her feet and removed a piece of parchment from her pocket a week before harry first birthday lily had come to cadence with a special request she had given her a small slip of parchment with the words of a death poem upon it although cadence had shrugged the matter off lightly and assured her friend that it probably wouldntbe needed she had felt honoured by the responsibility lily had given her that poem in the event that she died she had informed cadence that it was only to be given to harry on his seventeenth birthday in the case of such an incident cadence gazed at the crumpled parchement through bleary eyes wondering about it purpose it had to be more then a simple poem for it so be of such importance lily must have jinxed it somehow though she was at a loss as to what for cadence bit her lip and cleared her mind of her ponderings she had come to a conclusion in all her confusion she knew what she must do unfortunately it might result in her being unable to carry out lily wishes but cadence refused to let that happen drawing her wand cadence cast an extremely advanced spell on the parchment she watched as it glowed brightly pink and then yellow for a moment before setting it gently upon the headstone then with a deep breath cadence turned fully prepared to fight for what she believed in as she left the cemetary the piece of parchment began dissolving into the headtone even in the darknening light the fading words could just be made out by a stranger that had just arrived at the cemetary black hair whipped in the wind as deep blue eyes took in the writing do not stand at my grave and weep i am not there i do not sleep i am a thousand winds that blow i am the diamond glints on snow i am the sunlight on ripened grain i am the gentle autumn rain when you awaken in the morning hush i am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight i am the soft stars that shine at night do not stand at my grave and cry i am not there i did not die 000 alice didnteven have the energy to scream as a body binding curse hit her from behind her brown eyes widened in fear and shock as two hooded figures loomed above her having just ambushed her after entering her own home her eyes darted desperately to frank but he had already been subdued by yet another two death eaters with what seemed to be great satisfaction the death eaters laughed their eyes gleaming with mirth alice wanted to scream at them in rage and fury but her mouth was still quite frozen as the death eaters pulled down their heads and removed their masks their identities were revealed to the longbottoms bellatrix and rodolphus lestrange rabastan lestrange and to her enormous surprise bartemius crouch junior were all there giggling and chuckling as though this were a pleasent get together oh how mighty are dumbledore little aurors now rabastan spat his pale eyes glinting maniacally alice tried to struggle against the hex holding her but it was no use desperately she attempted to non verbally free herself but her wand in her pocket wouldntreact alice supposed it was due to her lack of magic ever since lily and james had died depression had reduced her magic significantly take their wands bellatrix ordered coldly her voice calm and demanding she seemed quite eager to get down to business alice glared at rodolphus as he snatched her wand away and then moved on to frank the moment both their wands were in custody the death eaters freed them alice immediatly stumbled into frank protective arms what do you want frank asked hoarsely trying will all his might to live up to his gryffindor bravery needless to say by his pale complexion and raspy voice he was failing dismally we ll cut straight to the chase then rodolphus hissed as crouch juniour watched eagerly we know how close you are to dumbledore and to the pathetic potters we want to know where the dark lord is when both frank and alice remained silent in their bewilderment and fear bellatrix impatiently snapped tell us now w w w e dontknow alice whimpered as the death eaters kept their wands trained firmly on their victims liar crouch junior hissed moving forwards in the darkness of the unlit house tell us or you will pay the consequences frank moved infront of alice attempting to shield her from view he remaned unbudging despite alice desperate shoving frank p please she wailed we dontknow frank said firmly your sad excuse for a leader is probably dead he added venemously the death eaters looked as though they had been slapped grab the woman bellatrix ordered with a sneer rodolphus and rabastan stepped forwards collectively but frank snarled at them donttouch her oh how touching bellatrix simpered angrily get her frank tried to fight them off but he was no match against their collective magic within moments he had been bound by invisble ropes perhaps you need a little persuading bartemius suggested through clenched teeth crucio alice attempted to dive out of the way but her lack of energy resulted in slow reactive skills with a simple jet of light pain was inflicted upon the witch like none other she had experianced it was pain beyond pain and the only thing that kept alice from begging for her death was the image of her son neville within moments the curse was lifting leaving alice gasping for breath as she struggled for oxygen she distantly heard frank pleadings but before she had time to gather her senses a second crucio had hit her she screamed wishing it would end hoping praying again neville face popped up in her mind weaker then before but there nonetheless desperately she focused on the image feeling love surge through her body almost as soon as this emotion began the cruciactus curse was lifted crouch junior was looking frustrated but spoke to frank in a low even voice last chance longbottom he warned dangerously no please i dont frank begged but he couldntfinish with agony he watched as the death eater cruelly cast the curse for a last time on alice it was over within minutes a few minutes of boke chilling screams and heart wrenching pain and it was over frank shivered as his sweat and tears coated his skin and he was released from his binds sobbing he dragged himself over to alice shaking body and laid a hand on her shoulder alice love he whispered gently desperation emanating in his voice but a single look into alice kind brown eyes revealed her broken soul frank screamed in fury and turned enraged to the death eaters he hadntmade it two steps when the curse hit him and he fell beside his wife slowly frank joined his wife in insanity having been tortured by their very love for each other with the ending of their lives their shattered souls joined the fragments of their broken hearts 000 cadence struggled against the wind ignoring the biting cold as it knawed at her exposed skin despite the freezing temperatures she praised her luck for sending her a blizzard it was the perfect way to sneak past all the wizarding guards azkaban had in place the snow continued to rush past catching on cadence thin black robes and in her now dull hair all depression seemed to have abandoned her as she now strode through the snowdrifts a fierce determination alit in her eyes as she pushed on through the storm she let her mind wander serena blonde hair and light green eyes found it way into her memories cadence was struck with sadness as she remembered her old friend and all the good times they had shared she remembered them laughing at honeydukes and cheering at quidditch games poor serena had never even had a chance in the real world she had been victimized before the war had really fully begun cadence stumbled on a patch of ice but quickly regained her balance she tried to ignore the pang of sadness at the memory of callidora which entered her mind at that moment but was unable to stop the memories from flowing with tedious recollection she thought back on shopping trips with her old friend chocolate binges and even that one time they saved those kids from the fires they had remained best friends through the good and the bad and yet calli too had left her in a darkening world even more aches plagued her heart as cadence thoughts drifted to lily james and harry she and lily had been best friends ever since the first year it seemed impossible that they would ever be seperated and yet here she was trudging through a blizzard to reach azkaban prison without lily spirited and brave personality by her side fighting back tears of both laughter and sadness cadence reflected on james and lily school days it seemed so unlikely that such a pair had gone on to make such a fairytale couple cadence attention was brought back to present as out of the blinding whiteness a large black shadow appeared it seemed that she had finally reached the prison walls taking a deep breath she wondered just what measures of defense had been applied to the boundary and tragicly she would never find out as cadence took out her wand prepared to do the wall some heavy damage a hoarse rattling sound distracted her in alarm she spun around only to find her blood run cold not one but five dementors were approaching her in the snow cadence felt a sob rise up in her throat yet fury burned in her heart these heartless creatures had imprisoned the innocent they had imprisoned the man she had finally realized she loved the dementors continued to glide steadily towards her their emotions merciless and hungry cadence felt herself grow colder if that was indeed possible no she screamed desperately please i just have to see sirius i i have to tell him i sorry she felt tears sting her eyes in the frozen wasteland as she hopelessly tried to reason with the unreasonable the dementors continued their advance without halting cadence felt sorrow pierce her heart and in that instant she knew what was coming an attempt to break in or out of azkaban instantly sentenced the perpetrator to the dementor kiss cadence felt ever bit of desperation well up inside her as the dementor began to lower it hood no she shrieked but this time her voice was tinged with determination i wontdie like this furiously cadence dodged away from the foul creature and began summoning up the happiest image she could conjure a photograph of all of her friends taken at their year seven graduation surfaced to mind and cadence held it close as she bellowed expecto patronum instantly a phantom hawk burst from her wand and streaked towards the closest dementor cadence emotions had been running impeccably high for the patronus chased away the dementors with ease as the last one disappeared into the fog cadence let herself collapse into the snow shivering she pulled her knees close to her body for both comfort and warmth my turn she thought grimly but strangely enough she felt no tears come to he eyes instead a sense of acceptance seemed to weigh upon her she was not the type of person who could live without her friends and sirius cadence sighed as she closed her eyes for the last time and as her conciousness began to fade she thought i love you sirius as a last bit of goodness and hope died in the frozen purgatory of azkaban two more lives joined the broken and forgotten it was the shattering of times before it really began and only fragments were left to piece back the puzzle author note tear well it finished and i apologize for postponing it so much i guess some part of me really just didntwant to end it all it hard to believe that it finally over i ve been working on this story for an entire year and a month i guess it become such a big part of my writing life anyhow i know i ve promised a sequel for this story and i have been considering it the only thing i ve realized is that with starting highschool and all i dontknow if i ll have much extra time however i did give you all my word and i did leave the story off so that it can be continued and so i ve made my decision there will be a followup for this story taking place after harry sixth year but i should think that the updates are going to take longer as well i will be working to revise and edit this one at the same time so it will take awhile for anyone interested this story may be having small parts rewritten and i ve contemplated adding a few chapters in the middle so keep updated if you want to check out the editations and additions so that it my final author note for this story a bit sad a bit relieving i can definitely promise more writing in the future so until next time and please drop me a final review too if you have a moment before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 5 lost in a dream sirius and cadence headed back towards the castle after an hour of bliss contentedly sirius enjoyed the feeling of her hand in his as he watched her mildly wavy hair seemingly float in the breeze she caught him staring and blushed sirius she protested playfully what he said automatically playing innocent you re staring again cadence replied punching his arm lightly well i canthelp it if i ve got the most beautiful girlfriend in the world sirius said romantically and then wrapping his arms around her he pulled her close so that he met her lips softly moments later the couple broke away breathless but extremely satisfied once again they attempted to re enter the castle but not before cadence observant hazel eyes fell on a shadowy figure making his way past the game keepers hut on the edge of the forest is that peter she asked suspiciously sirius tore his eyes reluctantly from cadence face and squinted in the direction she was pointing too i think so he muttered quietly and without a word set off in long strides in that direction sirius cadence protested we should really be getting up to the castle it getting dark and with all this death eater stuff we ll go in just a second besides we cantleave peter here by himself the idiot he should know it not safe to be out alone sirius replied distractedly though his voice was wrought with concern cadence in spite of her hesitancy felt a pang of worry peter really shouldntbe out here by himself so hurriedly the two battled the on coming darkness and broke off into a run towards peter stooped figure oi peter sirius called when they were in hearing distance panting cadence caught up with him both of them watched as peter swung around apparantly startled from the look on his face sirius strode up to him grabbing cadence hand and pulling her along peter what are you doing it not safe you know sirius said worriedly peter remained motionless for a moment then stuttered nervously o o oh i know it j just i ve lost my c c cat cadence immediatly made to comfort the boy for whom she d always felt a bit sorry for dontworry peter i sure he ll turn up but remember all the death eater stuff and she cast a nervous glance around as though expecting one to jump out at that very moment and attack them peter nodded as if dumbstruck and allowed himself to be herded back to the castle 00000 lily glanced at her watch with a huge yawn how d it get so late she said thickly covering her mouth with her hand alice quickly checked the time on her own watch and shrugged i dunno but i off to bed i exhausted catch you later lily she stated it been a rough few days with that alice seized her supplies and scrambled up the stairs lily watched her go she had done her rounds already and the others had retired ages ago lily had opted to stay up as she found she wasntreally tired the only person in the common room besides herself was james who was scribbling away madly at an essay she imagined it must be potions as he hadntdone well and was now referring to a large volume titled cures for the cursed and injured lily watched his coppery eagle feather quill move back and forth on his parchment the red glimmers caused by the distance and lighting as the quill moved with acute speed as it formed words entranced lily and for a while she sat contentedly watching it her eyes following the fiery reflection obsessively abruptly james looked up and immediatly lily broken from her reverie snapped her head away a moment later she dared a look back but apparantly james had not noticed her dazed staring and was now correcting his work suddenly the portrait door swung open and peter walked through followed by sirius and cadence who were hand in hand grinning lily leapt to her feet to greet her friend she waited patiently as sirius gave her a peck on the lips and then made his way across the room to james followed by tag a long peter so lily inquired unable to stop smirking fortunately cadence didntseem to mind so what she shot back innocently lily rolled her eyes you know cadence shrugged acting as though she didntknow what lily was talking about fine if you d rather i get specific so did you have a good time with sirius snogging and doing merlin knows what lily teased cadence pulled a shocked expression lily what kind of girl do you think i am really oh let not get into this again you know as well as i do that you and sirius are both the more outgoing sort lily explained with a fake note of exasperation in her voice finally giving in cadence smiled wickedly true true she mumbled thoughtfully but anyways it was good we just went for a walk across the grounds so you re over mark then are you lily inquired cautiously referring to cadence ex boyfriend whom she had dated for half of fifth year and all of sixth cadence nodded thankfully showing no sign of tears yeah i was over that jerk months ago lily smiled gladly she had hated recieving letters from cadence full of remorse and depression everyday that summer anyways cadence cut in interrupting lily thoughts how come you haventdated anyone in so long lily taken off guard by this question blushed slightly why do you ask cadence shrugged and gazed at her intently when lily failed to reply she added come on alice is going out with frank i dating sirius calli involved with that durmstrang guy briac i think and serena been dating off on for the last year i mean the last person you actually dated was fabion prewett in fourth year i went on a date with lovegood last year oh big deal you went to hogsmeade with him once but he turned out to be a real lunatic didnthe cadence said exasperatedly ok ok i get it lily snapped impatiently then immediatly softened sorry it just well i dontknow cadence waited patiently for lily to find her words to explain i d just prefer to wait for someone worthwhile you know someone i can actually picture a future with i dontwant to waste my time with somebody just for fling well how do you expect to ever find somebody worthwhile if you dontgive anyone a chance cadence asked impatiently lily bit her lip then narrowed her eyes this situation seemed awfully familiar to her what are you suggesting she asked suspciously cadence grinned realizing her friend had caught on just that you cantactually know if somebodies right for you if you never give them a try cadence replied trying to keep a smirk off her face i mean james potter for example but cadence never got to finish her sentence for lily flared up immediatly if you re suggesting i give that bullying arrogant toad a shot then you ve lost your mind she stated angrily cadence looked taken aback for someone who d rather try and ignore his existence you certainly do spend a lot of time thinking about him even if it isntin such a positive manner cadence retorted cooly lily blushed slightly then scowled whatever i hate potter and that not about to change lily said vehemently cadence shrugged as though it was a matter of little important fine it your decision but you better choose someone to bestow your heart upon quickly because in case you haventnotice potter attempts have only gotten more outrageous these last years i wouldntbe surprised if the next thing he tried was a curse to prevent any other male in the school from approaching you cadence stated trying to lighten the mood with a joke lily allowed a small smile to grace her face maybe but for now i ll just keep dreaming she mused more like your lost in a dream cadence replied teasingly lily rolled her eyes suddenly a rustle from behind the girls caught their attention swinging around lily caught a glimpse of sirius and james fleeing up the boy staircase eyes widening in horror lily seized the nearest object to her which happened to be some first year forgotten textbook and flung it at their retreating heads lily heard a satisfying thunk and moan before the boys disappeared completely from sight potter lily hollared sirius black cadence voice echoed after lily s they both exchanged furious glances but before she could help it cadence burst into laughter it not funny lily spat breathing heavily cadence merely paused and glanced at her friends furious expression framed by her red hair which was falling out of it pony tail and laughed harder then before lily knew what was happening she was giggling then that giggling turned to laughter which quickly erupted into hyseterical mirth not quite knowing what was so funny lily marched up to bed minutes later clutching her sides furious as she was about the eavesdroppiing incident she couldntquite forget the hilarity of the bump one of the marauders would be sporting in the morning a n i really had fun writing this chapter as deep as it delves the end was just light hearted anyways i hope people will really enjoy this chapter not only because it was funny or at least i thought it was but because i ve dropped major hints before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 6 awakening as lily and her friends sat eating breakfast at the great hall the next morning she help but keep shooting expectant glances at the doors to the great hall she was eagerly awaiting the moment she would get to see which marauder she had sniped with the textbook the night previous cadence and herself had already filled the rest of their friends in about the incident all seemed to think it was rather funny suddenly lily heard a startled gasp from her left alice is everything okay calli asked looking panicky and tense alice nodded slowly still reading whatever news it was ludovic bagman has been arrested on charges of being related to death eater acitivty lily turned her astonished green eyes onto the article i dontbelieve it she muttered who d have ever thought serena however looked un perturbed well as long as nobody dead she said flatly yeah i suppose cadence said quietly the group continued eating in silence ignoring the chatting around them lily kept looking towards the entrance at frequent intervals it was almost time to leave for classes when the marauders finally made an appearance remus was leading the way a half smile pasted onto his face following him was a tired looking peter eagerly lily craned her neck to get a view behind them she was not disappointed james shuffled in trying to conceal a large red bump on the side of his head with his right hand grinning lily exchanged a serves him right look with cadence sirius meanwhile was practically skipping behind them apparantly over joyed he was not the one that had been hit cantremember that healing charm lily heard remus ask smugly james merely scowled at him in reply lily had to stifle a giggle as they passed wow lily you got him good alice remarked as she watched them settle themselves at the end of the table i wonder why he hasntgone to madam pomfrey though trivial as it is she could at least get rid of that goose egg calli exclaimed wonderingly serena answered probably too embarrassing she grinned her light turquoise eyes sparkling with amusement if only i could have been there cadence snorted into her oatmeal with humour as the rest of them laughed appreciatively 00000 james wound from lily however was probably the last very amusing thing that would happen in the next few months the teachers were piling unreasonable amounts of homework and almost every second of the seventh year free time was spent in the library or else in the common room beside a stack of books a few hogsmeade trips came and went but lily and her friends only embarked on a trip to the village once and for only a few hours they was simply too much homework to be dealing with it therefore came as a great relief when christmas arrived bringing with it a heavenly break and plenty of glittering snow as lily parents had passed away the previous year she would be spending the break at the castle and her friends opted to keep her company for which she was grateful lily cadence calli serena and alice had spent the last few days wrapping their gifts and lily who had head girl duties was forced to decorate the castle with james this was probably the only unenjoyable activity she had to bear with during this season excluding all the daily prophet news of recent attacks and murders everytime they went to work hanging garland or decorating the trees in the great hall lily had to bear with an increasingly annoying james although he was constantly trying to initiate conversation and on more then one occasion accidentally got holly caught in her hair she supposed she should grateful that he had at least stopped his daily attempts to ask her out however she made sure to keep far away from the mistletoe in his presence just in case so what are your plans for christmas he said cheerily on christmas eve as they finally finished the decorating lily turned to face him irritably i dontbelieve that any of your business potter she replied rather unkindly he had somehow just managed to dump an enormous pile of non melting snow on her head though he swore on his broomstick it was an accident again however james didntseem put off though by her words instead he retaliated with flair well actually it would be you see i have to know where you ll be if i to send you a christmas gift i d rather you dontthanks she replied thinking uncomfterably of the dozens of small gifts he had sent over the last few years they were all crammed in the bottom of her trunk for some reason she hadntthrown them away though she had never looked at them twice james frowned this time and lily found herself feeling a tad sorry for him it must be the christmas mood that going around she thought feeling sorry for that arrogant gargoyle lily stopped at this thought though the last time he had actually done anything fat headed was the eavesdropping incident frowning lily pondered this was he ill or had he actually matured well whatever lily decided firmly i do not like potter again lily stopped as she listened to her own confused thoughts where did that come from awkwardly lily dared a quick glance at james who was now busy placing ornaments on the the last tree wonderful job you two proffesor mcgonagall announced strolling into the hall with a rare smile on her face lily beamed snapping out of her reverie james however did not return the professor smile but continued to gaze moodily at the floor sensing the tension mcgonagall wisely dismissed them just in times to do my rounds and get in bed early lily thought satisfiedly hurriedly she set off to do them darting a quick last look at james all the while considering his apparant change of heart by the time lily had returned to the common room she had decided that she should apologize she couldntleave him so dejected on christmas it was the holiday after all after telling her friends who were playing games like wizard chess and exploding snap that she needed to do something she looked around for the marauders please say they re not up to another ridiculous prank she thought gritting her teeth but much to her relief they came in through the portrait as if on cue nervously she approached them ignoring her friends astonished looks james who was still visibly moping took no notice to her as he and sirius were apparantly reliving the frosty conversation previously wringing her hands apprehensively she opened her mouth to speak encouaraged by remus reassuring gaze er potter may i have a word james head shot up in surprise peter was wide eyed and gaping while sirius had frozen with shock even remus looked mildly astonished ignoring there startled reactions james nodded and followed her out the portrait hole leaving a stunned gryffindor common room behind them fancy a walk lily asked in an attempt to be cheerful james didntreply but narrowed his eyes suspiciously as he followed her i wontsend you a gift if that what you re worried about he said abruptly sounding unusually cold lily paused in surprise and turned around to face him it was slightly unerving to see his expression so stony that not what i wanted to talk about she said quietly letting her voice echo off the stone walls well then what is it he asked indifferently lily glanced down at her hands nervously er just that well i sorry the two stood facing each other in shocked silence i cantbelieve i just apologized to potter i cantbelieve evans is apologizing to me james coldness seemed to melt before lily eyes his hazel eyes twinkled with joy apology accepted lily dared a cautious smile and i suppose i sorry for how i ve treated you for the last few years she said james shook his head slightly no i sorry i really shouldnthave been so persistant he smiled weakly but struck by the oddness of the situation lily had a fleeting thought of how cute he looked with that sheepish expression but still refusing to admit her sudden attraction she replied briskly apology accepted so i guess there nothing between us anymore animosity i mean she added quickly no well not really james replied thoughtfully lily raised an eyebrow what do you mean not really but james didntanswer instead he gazed up at the ceiling potte i mean james lily tried again she followed his gaze where there was a wad of mistletoe attatched her emerald eyes widened of all the things she thought incredulously wondering why she didntflee while she had the chance stunned with disbelief and a new unfamiliar feeling rising within her chest she watched as james tentatively stepped closer slowly james lowered his face and gazed into her eyes lily felt numb as he moved in and wrapped his arms around her she was even more surprise as she returned the action 00000 minutes later lily burst through the portrait hole blushing scarlet but a joyous feeling coursing through her body immediatly she ran over to cadence and exclaimed i not dreaming anymore i awake a n sorry for the long time gap but instead of filling it up with unnessecary boring everyday events i thought i d skip ahead i think i managed it pretty smoothly anyways i personally love this chapter james and lily have finally made peace well i hope you enjoyed please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 7 unexpected surprises can you please repeat that alice asked incredulously lily and her friends had all gathered in her dormitory and they were all listening with rapt attention to lily as she retold her account of the night events james and i made peace lily replied as she unwrapped a chocolate frog no the part after that alice said lily felt a blush creeping across her cheeks well i er looked up and well mistletoe she mumbled indistinctly suddenly overcome with uncharacteristic embarrassment suddenly cadence punched a fist into the air hah i knew it wow serena cut in i m still in shock you and james not only made up but you kissed it wasntreally personal lily said defensively serena raised an eyebrow well okay i guess it was did you get him a gift lily alice asked serenely watching the conversation amusedly oh no well it not like i was expecting this to happen lily said feeling distinctly uncomfterable knowing full well that james would have bought her a gift to lily amazement alice smiled well i got frank a large pack of drooble best chewing gum and a box of bertie botts then i found out he not fond of candy so lily flung her arms around alice thanks alice lily exclaimed brightly lily caught serena and calli exchange a smug smirk from the corner of her eye lily for someone who absolutely hated james for so many years you sure are whipped over him now serena told lily upon catching her glare i am not whipped lily protested as she began to wrap the sweets alice had just retreived from her trunk no you re just falling madly and hopelessly in love cadence replied in a tauntingly dreamy voice give it a break guys calli said though she still had a wide grin painted on her face lily shot her a thankful look well girls i getting to bed busy day tomorrow alice said through a yawn lily nodded as she checked her watch night all calli nodded and got up to leave followed by serena so lily overall did you have a good christmas eve alice asked once they were both tucked into their blankets lily grinned into her covers you know what i think i did 000 so you kissed evans you actually kissed her prongs sirius asked for the millionth time that evening the marauders were spending their christmas eve up in their shared dormitory enjoying sweets and listening to james tale avidly james rolled his eyes no i ve just been saying it for the last hour because i delusional he remarked sarcastically so how was it peter asked curiously sirius shot him a scandalised look what kind of question is that wormtail peter immediatly drew back but james smiled at him perfect so now what prongs remus broke in james looked completely befuddled what do you mean moony well all these years your main goal has been to catch lily and now that you ve got her he replied curiously james appeared to think hard about this for a moment i suppose to keep her sirius nodded wisely and peter snorted james shot him a dirty look not that this isntinteresting or anything but i think i ready for bed sirius said after a long pause of silence a minute ago you were all excited about the news remus said scathingly ignoring his friends sarcasm sirius shrugged i guess it gets old quick i mean james has been after her so long he would eventually have to make some progress remus rolled his eyes well i agree with you on the bed part i exhausted james nodded in agreement and still revelling in the evening excitement the marauders went to bed 00000 christmas morning dawned exactly as it should bright and merry by the time lily had awoken cadence was already half through her pile of presents thanks for the hand mirror it beautiful where d you get it cadence asked when lily had sat up in bed a muggle jewellery store i thought you might like it lily responded rubbing the sleep from her eyes hey alice get up lily reached over and shook her still sleeping friend alice pushed her hair sleepily off her face and stretched happy christmas happy christmas cadence and lily chorused together happily lily eyed the stack of presents at the edge of her bed in good spirits she seized the nearest parcel and tore it open thanks alice she said laying down a thick book beside her she continued to open presents at a reasonable speed until there was only one remaining james gift to her was neatly wrapped in glittering red paper with a gold bow fastened around it smiling she vaguely recalled last night gently lily unwrapped the paper and found a small box coated with black velvet she opened it gingerly and gave a small gasp as it revealed a glittering silver bracelet nice bracelet lily whose that from alice asked as she glanced up from her own pile of half opened gifts james she nearly whispered slipping the delicate chain onto a wrist a small crystal heart dangling from it how sweet cadence said somewhat flatly she had finished unwrapping her own presents and was now cleaning up the mess around her beside all sirius got me was a lousy package of chocolate frogs lily gave her a sympathetic look alice however was staring at something in her palm which lily couldntsee from her angle alice you okay lily asked tentatively alice turned her face to lily her eyes full of tears and nodded smally what wrong cadence catching sight of her friend nothing wrong alice finally managed then what is it lily and cadence asked in frustrated unison frank proposed 00000 good lot this year sirius exclaimed tossing the last box aside curiously he peered over at his friends piles james was lovingly gazing at a box of sweets on his bedside and peter was busy gorging on a large stack of mince pies remus however was reading a long letter what d you send evans prongs peter squeaked ahh just a bracelet what about you padfoot what d you send your girl james replied grinning sirius swore i knew i was forgetting something sirius how thick do you have to be to forget to send your girlfriend something remus asked exasperatedly i ve been busy sirius responded ruefully peter rolled his eyes with what helping moony have you forgotten last week full moon he almost got out sirius exclaimed a note of embarressed frustration clouding his shout remus looked at the floor guiltily dontworry moony we know you canthelp it but sirius good luck explaining that to cadence james replied wearily sirius covered his face with his hands in stress meanwhile cadence was fuming after giving lily the chocolate

plot that formed this fanfic chapter 8 times of change that morning after leaving her dorm lily was greeted warmly by james who she thanked profusely for the beautiful bracelet cadence although furious with sirius at first even began to cheer up due to all the festive activites taking place around the castle this may also have been due to the fact that sirius had managed to conjure a pair of beautiful earrings by lunch time now that lily and james were on speaking terms and maybe a little more then that the girls spent the majority of the day with the marauders and it remained this way for the rest of holidays the day before term began again lily and her friends could be found lounging in the common room they and the marauders were finishing off the last of their christmas sweets and sipping on some butterbeers sirius and james had managed to nick from the kitchens although lily and the girls were unaware of this lily serena and alice lay sprawled out on the large hearth rug before the fire working on alice wedding plans they had already decided that lily being alice oldest friend would get to be the maid of honour so i think that all the bride maids should all wear yellow it ll match the decorations perfectly alice said thoughtfully chewing on the tip of her quill serena and lily nodded absently mindedly alice being extremely excited about her wedding practically had the whole thing planned out already she had written back to frank on christmas day asap with her answer and ever since she had been working ecstatically on her plans frank and alice had already agreed that their wedding would take place on july the fifteenth alice have you decided where the wedding is going to be cadence asked from where she was sitting with sirius of course she has she already planned out what time the food is going to be served and everything sirius said sarcastically everyone ignored him in a church in the town where frank lives and he already picked us out a house to live in nearby alice replied brightly smiling lily unwrapped a chocolate frog and popped it in her mouth seconds after she had swallowed she knew something was wrong a numbness began spreading through her body from her toes she began coughing furiously as she struggled to breathe lily she heard james voice though it sounded very distant lily are you okay but as she tried to answer her vision clouded and she blacked out the last thing she heard was callidora frantic voice saying quick we need to get her to the hospital wing 000 lily awoke suddenly to a soft snoring looking around panickedly she recongnized the hospital wing white furniture feeling weak and tired she pushed herself up and spotted james sleeping in a chair his head drooping onto the end of her bed she watched as he slowly awoke disturbed by her sudden movements lily you re awake james exclaimed hoarsely she tried to smile but she winced at the pain this simple gesture caused what happened she asked weakly madam pomfrey said you were poisoned from one of the chocolate frogs cadence has been so worried she says it her fault for giving you them she said sirius sent them but sirius told dumbledore he didn t james said hurriedly grabbing her hand and squeezing it but then who sent them lily asked her brow furrowed slightly well dumbledore suspects voldemort lily blinked unflinchingly or one of his death eaters was trying to kill off muggle borns and half bloods cadence is half blood right but now all the teachers are putting extra security on the post and everything so you donthave to worry james replied still talking in a quick hushed voice lily gaped she had never expected to be attacked in such fashion i just glad you re alright james added when she said nothing i couldntstand to lose you when i d just got you lily couldnthelp but smile at his sweet sincerity 000 two days later lily was released from the infirmary feeling much better she caught up easily with her classes and as her health returned months passed hurriedly with only one major incident james parents who had been aurors were murdered in their house one night distraught it tooks weeks for lily to cheer james who she was now officially dating up again lily was able to relate easily for her parents had died only the last year and eventually with her encouragement and empathy lily managed to get james out of his rut of gloom just in time for exams newts arrived unwelcomely in june bringing with them much stress and frustration but they too seemed to hurry past and lily felt she had done her grades justice proffesor dumbledore had also announced that due to the unreliability of owl post these days who knows if death eaters would intercept it and jinx it the students would recieve their results immediatly much to the dismay of the students lily was ecstatic to find she had recieved an o in all her subjects except for arithmancy in which she had managed an e cadence however was less happy all the others had achieved results good enough for whatever career they were hoping to pursue but cadence had failed potions dismally unfortunately she would now be unable to become an auror finally one thing arrived that was bound to cheer her up a hogsmeade trip was scheduled for the weekend after exams as a treat to the seventh years who would never again attend there as students this was a brlliant idea of dumbledore s james exclaimed happily as he and lily walked hand in hand towards the popular wizarding village that saturday yeah hopefully it cheers poor cadence up lily agreed looking back over her shoulder to see cadence and sirius walking a distance behind them looking pleased remus and serena were walking with sirius and cadence chatting about the exams peter however was stuck in detention for being in possesion of some kindof map this fact seemed to greatly displease the rest of the marauders although lily was confused why what was so upsetting about the loss of a stupid map callidora was already in hogsmeade having left early to meet her boyfriend briac as durmstang let their students out early alice was walking beside lily looking very eager frank was meeting her at the three broomsticks they soon arrived at the village where they all split up lily and james agreed to go with alice to meet frank while sirius and cadence left to check out zonkos joke shop remus and serena set off in a hurry in an attempt to locate calli and briac oh i cantwait to see frank again alice chattered happily as she led the way to madam rosmerta famous pub she was walking so fast lily and james practically had to jog to keep up upon reaching the place alice pushed the doors open and hurried in lily squinted to see as she followed her friend out of the bright sunlight and into the comparedly darker room alice a deep voice boomed as they closed the door they all turned to see mr longbottom tall figure rising from a table to meet them he gave his fiance a quick kiss on the cheek and then shook hands with james so lily i hear you re to be the maid of honour at our wedding he asked as he embraced her quickly lily knew frank from sixth year when he and alice had begun dating yes i cantwait for the wedding you two are perfect for each other lily replied earnestly alice and frank beamed at her why dontwe all have a drink alice suggested cheerfully taking frank hand as he led them to a bigger table soon the four of them found themselves in a happy discussion of their plans for the future during which james confessed he wasntsure what he was going to do seeing as he had inherited a large fortune from his parent death after finishing their bottles of butterbeer and james and frank had finished their glasses of firewhiskey they all headed back outside they all decided to take a nice walk by the shrieking shack for old times sake lily was exceptionally interested in seeing the old rickety building again as she had recently learned about remus ailment he and james had confessed to her one night when she found james trying to sneak out of the castle when they arrived they were pleasently surprised to find serena callidora and remus gazing at the house remus was looking at it with a look of mingled disgust and reminisensce on his face fancy seeing you here moony james called grinning at his fellow marauder remus grimaced before returning a small smile tentatively calli where briac lily asked as the groups drew level calli waved her hand in the air carelessly he had to leave for a job interview but its no matter she said then turned to frank hey frank congragulations on the engagement thanks he replied graciously as he wrapped his arm around alice lily turned to look at the old building james followed suit and gave a long sigh so many memories he murmured quietly so only remus and lily who were closest to where he stood could hear hey what is that remus asked suddenly pointing to a figure standing near the shack lily narrowed her green eyes trying to see who it was but he was so far it was hard to make out suddenly the figure gave a strangled yell i think he in trouble alice gasped as she too stared at the figure c mon frank said leaping over the fence we might need to help him he pulled out his wand as he ran pulling alice with his other one lily and james exchanged alarmed looks before they too charged towards the figure lily could hear remus calli and serena laboured breath behind her as she ran just as they neared the man who they now saw was cloaked he turned tail and ran into the trees behind the shrieking shack lily desire to help was becoming steadily filled with suspiscion as they chased him into the shade of the beech trees james pulled her to a halt once they were a few paces into the forest what going on lily heard calli asked quietly frank had his wand out a look of sheer alarm on his face as he directed the beam of light from his wand around frantically lily noticed the figure was nowhere in sight she felt a great feeling of unease rise within her go back quickly i think it a trap frank told them hoarsely but it was too late within seconds no fewer then ten cloaked persons with white masks stepped out into the small clearing their wands were all out and pointing threateningly towards the group paralyzed with fear lily heard one deatheater cry avada kedavra a n sorry about the large gaps in this story but nothing interesting was really going to happen until the end of seventh year so i made it a little jumpy so yeah i hope you all enjoyed this chapter i know it was a little bit rushed but i wanted this chapter to be pretty fast paced thought i d end this one with a cliffhanger eh so once again i hope you enjoy this chapter i know i enjoyed writing it and please review before it began by skyquill summary james knew he was in love at first sight but what would it take for lily to love him back read their story leading up to their deaths and discover the dangers they faced and the loves and friendships they shared disclaimer i do not own most of the characters and places or anything else that may seem familiar j k rowling has the exclusive claim to this as well as the general plot that formed this fanfic chapter 9 laughter sunlight lily spun around in a kind of horrified daze her mind blanched as she watched serena slim body crumple to the ground in seemingly slow motion a flash of green enveloped her mind momentarily the sound of a power gust of wind echoed throughout the woods only callidora pained shriek brought lily out of her stupor tears now flooding to her eyes she whipped out her wand and aimed it towards the death eater who had just murdered her friend petrificus totalus taken by surprise the death eater went rigid as a board and fell forwards this seemed to be the cue the rest of the death eaters were waiting for without a second thought they began firing curses left right and center the woods had now become a scene of complete chaos lily had one hell of a job dodging various flashes of green and red as lily dodged two stunners she caught sight of the others rushing forwards to duel led by frank who was by far the most experianced stupefy lily screamed as she landed painfully on her elbow in an effort to avoid another curse her stunner missed the death eater she had aimed at but instead hit one behind him lily are you okay came james anxious voice from behind her struggling to her feet lily saw james had fought his way through a band of death eaters to see if she was okay she nodded hastily noticing his skin was as white as a ghost go and get help he told her firmly pushing her out of line of a hex i cantleave you here to fight them alone we re already outnumbered lily responded somewhat hysterically just then a beam of light hit james in the arm and a large gash appeared through his torn robes lily felt the color drain from her face just go james yelled as her rushed to meet the death eater who had just attacked him deciding it was best not to argue further lily scrambled past pairs of people dodging many spells on her way she had nearly reached the shrieking shack when a hand grabbed her wand arm tightly prepare to die mudblood a cool voice hissed from under his hood terror now taking over her actions lily swung her free fist towards his face wham the man grip loosened as her hand made contact wrenching free from his powerful grasp she turned her wand on him experlliamus she shrieked the death eater staggered backwards into a tree and his wand flew from his hand and arced back over the trees lily didntwait to see what he did next instead she turned heel and ran as fast as her feet would carry her she finally reached the dirt road and vaulting the wooden fence she ran back towards the village her mind was curiosly blank as she ran it seemed she was in such a state of panic she could only focus on one thing find a teacher lily could have fainted with release when she collided with proffesor flitwick mcgonagall and dumbledore exiting the three broomsticks proffesors she gasped clutching a stitch in her side proffesor but dumbledore raised a hand his blue eyes blazing with fury where are they he asked peering into her eyes behind the shrieking shack lily responded breathlessly for a moment lily stood there ignoring the curious looks the students were now giving her she watched dumbledore lead the other proffesor up the hill at a run before her mind clicked back into place again she took off as fast as she could go chasing after the proffesors it took less then five minutes to return dreading what she might find she entered the woods behind proffesor flitwick from her position she could see the death eaters apparating as dumbledore came into view anxiously she peered over flitwicks head for her friends frank and alice were standing side by side leaning against a tree for support callidora was hunched over serena lifeless body and was attempting fruitlessly to revive her the sight unbearable lily looked for james her observant eyes passed over lupin who was sporting a bleeding nose and fell on james he was lying still on the ground james she shrieked panic striken running over to his body but as she neared him a last remaning death eater stepped out from behind a tree and muttered something under his breath while drawing his wand across his chest lily felt a searing pain spread across her body and then everything went black 00000 when lily awoke she was surprised to find that she was not in the hogwarts hospital wing the room which she currently resided bore all the markings of a hospital yet there were prominent differences sitting up she saw cadence staring at her through puffy red eyes oh lily she sobbed throwing her arms around lily we ve been so worried are you okay came a second voice lily looked around from over cadence shoulder to see callidora perched on the edge of a wooden chair looking anxious i think so where am i lily responded faintly cadence gently removed herself from lily st mungos of course she said whiping her eyes dumbledore and mcgonagall brought us here flitwick remained behind to well callidora voice broke off a great sadness seemed to emenate from her solemn words brilliant idea to get help lily cadence cut in trying to change the topic her eyes too had clouded over as callidora explanation this statement brought lily mind back to james where james is he okay what happened to him she asked hurriedly ignoring the throbbing which pulsated throughout her sore body he fine he was just knocked out calli said quietly he in another ward lupin sirius and peter are with him but what about school and what happened to everyone else lily continued barely pausing to let the relief of james health wash over her term over you didntmiss much though and alice and frank are fine they were a bit shaken though alice is ummm well she s cadence said uncomfertably her eyes misting up oddly again suddenly an image of serena body sprawled across the leaves entered lily mind her wavy blonde hair spread out around her her turqoise eyes gazing into nothingness where serena lily quietly thought she already knew the answer cadence threw her arms around lily again and calli broke into sobs oh lily she gone calli cried joining in on the hug all three of them broke apart and cried silently for a moment until cadence finally broke the silence and she was the one who thought none of us were at risk she muttered quietly and now look at where we are lily and james in the hospital and her tears streamed down cadence face again like a waterfall each glistening drop shone with the loss of serena 00000 serena funeral took place five days after lily was released from the hospital james having been released just the day before stood beside her the whole time the ceremony took place in hogsmeade well away from the shrieking shack lily clutched james arm with a death grip as they carried the body past the crowd and towards the front serena muggle parents were clearly visible through the mass of people mrs dresi had a handkerchief grasped in her white hands while tears fell quite freely from her eyes it was common knowledge that the rest of serena muggle relatives had already had a private funeral ceremony lily watched in numb silence as the minister began his speech on serena brief life she didntshed a tear all signs of life seemed to have left and if it werentfor her white knuckles clasped firmly onto james arm one might ve thought her dead too when it was at last time to pay her respects lily finally broke down crumbling she fell to the ground onto her knees as she fingered serena cold hand sorrowfully distraught lily placed a yellow rose of friendship into the coffin and allowed james to lead her away back to where her friends and the marauders stood solemnly alice embraced her tearfully and the two stood for a moment letting their grief wash over them now what lily asked when they finally broke apart we were supposed to find somewhere to live before we left hogwarts i have no where to go i cantstand to go and live with petunia alice looked at her sympathetically she would of course be moving in with frank as her wedding was in a week lily calli you can move in with my family until we find a place cadence suggested finally looking up lily nodded gratefully that night the three girls bid goodbye to the marauders alice and frank and then used the three broomstick fireplace to floo their way to cadence s fortunately cadence being a half blood they would be in a wizarding house oh dears are you okay mrs summers asked as she rushed over lily found herself standing in the large sitting room of cadence small house cadence told me you all might be coming to stay lily and calli shot cadence curious looks cadence shrugged and managed a weak smile through her wet face and red rimmed eyes hello mr summers lily said in an attempt to be cheery as she addressed cadence muggle father hello lily callidora cadence honey he replied a look of mild surprise still on his face from their arrival by floo network you three look exhausted why dontyou head up to bed calli nodded mutely and the three then followed cadence mom up the stairs to a landing and into cadence bedroom with a wave of her wand mrs summers conjured up to comfy looking cots lily was pleasently surprised to see her trunk already there alice had brought her a few changes of clothes at the hospital and lily had forgotten all about her possesions throughout her despair thanks mrs summers lily said gratefully as cadence mom shut the door behind her without words cadence lily and calli proceeded to change into their pyjamas and climbed under their covers as lily arranged her blankets callidora stated calmly remember in first year when we all met shaking off her surprise lily rolled onto her stomach to face the other two yeah cadence merely nodded lily and serena couldntfind out how to get onto the platform cadence added her voice brightening and calli you were trying to help them serena went through but lily refused to budge lily blushed as the other two giggled and then i came along and just pushed her she went throught the platform alright and knocked serena over on the other side calli cut in laughingly lily couldnthelp joining in and then she got all offended and pretended she was going to hex me but you two came through and saved me then we all burst out laughing lily exclaimed as they all laughed a warmth began to spread through lily again a happiness that she hadntfelt since before they went on that fateful hogsmeade trip it felt good letting her laughter wsh away the pain and it reminded lily of something you know serena still with us i dontthink she ll ever truly leave as long as we remember her lily said her voice not pained but joyful the others agreed and for the rest of that night they shared memories they had shared at hogwarts it was like the graduation day they had never had owing to the circumstances and althought serena was not there in person all three of them could sense her in their laughter like a ray of sunshine at the end of a storm a n i thought this chapter was so sad anyways i decided to update before i left my mom so you could all have another chapter to dwell on i know they re rather close together but i was in the right mood to write it so i did dontworry the stories not over yet though i planning on this going just slightly past lily and james death so yeah i hope you enjoy this chapter and please review if you have a chance
