 i have to admit i really am sorry about how long it took me to update these things i ve been busy and lazy and i ve had school work sheesh i cantbelieve how many people really like this i really glad you all do so i ll just make the introduction short here thanks everyone notes x point of view change or a jump in time or things like that disclaimer i own nothing warnings it shonen ai chapter 3 where to start not really wanting to but having very little choice harry had followed lupin into the hall silently ignoring all the stares turning his way none of them cared about him in fact they were probably hoping he would be blamed for mrs weasley death and sent off to azkaban for it he frowned slightly wondering where those thoughts had come from they cared about him a little bit at least didntthey of course they did everyone in that room had risked their lives or reputations at least once for harry he had to just be over thinking things with all the stress and tension going on in number twelve it had to be a normal reaction to become paranoid harry now tell me the truth did that shadow leave the necklace last night lupin asked calmly harry thought it over for a few minutes had the shadow left he really wasntto sure he d gone to bed and then silence peaceful silence with dreams that he was unable to be awaken from i dontthink so he responded hoping he sounded convincing he didntknow what the truth was but knew if he told that to lupin the werewolf would no doubt get suspicious the necklace taken from him the words however sounded hollow even to him and he understood why a frown crossed lupin face you dontthink so harry this is a very serious thing that has just happened if you know anything at all i know it serious harry screamed his anger rising mrs weasley is dead and she died with me holding a grudge against her a silence fell over them and harry tried his best to get himself under control he was already being accused of underage magic but if the court thought he d gone and murdered someone he was sure he d be sent to azkaban without second thought everyone who d of deemed him evil in the past would say they were right and then he d be left alone with no one to turn to the necklace would be taken away and they d let the dementors come in and harry shivered at the thought of having his soul stolen through his mouth i didntdo it if the outburst had caused lupin any shock it was nothing compared to what he felt when those words left harry mouth harry i never even thought that you were the cause of it i know you would never hurt mrs weasley intentionally harry nodded slowly and they both looked up when sirius walked into the hall he looked from his lover to his godson and wasntcompletely sure as to whose side to take he finally decided on staying neutral what going on here sirius you help me out here i worried that the shadow had something to do with mrs weasley death lupin said filling his boyfriend in as quickly as he could on the subject without getting anyone else dragged into it remus didntyou hear the death was caused for sure by a witch or wizard not a magical creature harry instantly felt a wave of relief it was definitely understandable that lupin had thought the shadow was behind mrs weasley death even harry had thought that for a moment but he would still die trying to defend hearing now that there was no way the shadow a magical creature could do it made him feel that much surer that the shadow was innocent when did you find this out lupin asked surprised i told him the three of them looked up as mad eye moody walked into the hall his magical glass eye swirling around crazily got yourselves into a lot of trouble while i was gone i told you to always be on guard everyone shifted nervously at this and harry found himself getting quite annoyed again what had gone from a talk alone with lupin which he was quite used to having sirius had joined in which was all right but now with mad eye moody it was getting uncomfortable ron and hermione would no doubt be the next to walk over and join in as if things werentbad enough already listen from what i know i have nothing at all to do with this harry said flatly all three of the men turning to look at him and what happens if you just dontremember mad eye asked making harry insides turn a bit what if he really didntjust remember and he had killed mrs weasley he had after all gotten very mad at her and hadntmagic been known to happen without a wand or control if the wizard or witch in question is very angry or worse what if the shadow had tricked him into doing it dontgo around accusing my godson for something we re not even sure he did sirius said emotionlessly i only going over things that may of happen moody answered without a second thought lupin sighed not liking at all the direction this conversation was going if things went on this way he just knew sirius and mad eye would get into a fight and it wouldntbe pretty why dontwe just drop this until morning remus asked hopefully harry nodded quickly and excused himself back into the room they d just come out of while sirius and mad eye squared each other off dontdo this he pleaded looking from his lover to the auror finally after a few more agonizing long moments they agreed to just go back into the living room and watch over the others while they slept harry had walked in and scanned the room a bit doing his best to try and not acknowledge the stares ron and hermione were giving him they both think i did it he thought to himself sitting back down in the chair he d been in before lupin had dragged him off to talk some great friends they are harry refused to look at them and closed his eyes trying to relax he wasntgoing to admit to anything not unless he had proof that he d done it sirius and the others walked in a few moments later and took their own seats again they didntlook at harry any more and he was just fine with that he didntneed anyone well no one besides the shadow so what if they thought the shadow had murdered mrs weasley it hadnthe knew that why would it murder anyone it was just a necklace and it wanted him only no one else it wouldntwaste its time going around and killing people harry was all it worried or cared about wasntit harry let out a small sigh and leaned back in the chair more what if the shadow was just using him maybe it just wanted to destroy the order and it figured the only way to do so was through harry yet hadntdumbledore been the one who d given harry the necklace in the first place did that mean dumbledore was evil the thought of a death eater in the guise of a headmaster working for voldemort wasnta pleasant one he d always said he didntfear voldemort perhaps it wasn t because dumbledore was so strong but because he worked for him no that cantbe right harry finally decided dumbledore had brought harry to live with his aunt and uncle and had done everything in his power to keep harry safe though couldntthat work two ways what if dumbledore had just kept him safe in hopes that he d turn sides and go with him to help voldemort harry let out a small groan and started rubbing his temples he was thinking way too much are you alright harry lupin asked cautiously fine harry muttered back but he knew he wasn t not really everything around him seemed to be shattering what was once his normal life even if that wasntcompletely normal was gone his friends were turning their backs on him and even the people he thought loved him as though he was their own child were backing off lupin frowned a bit looking around everyone even if it was just out of the corner of their eyes was staring at harry somehow they had all come to the conclusion that harry had gone out of his way to kill mrs weasley they had no proof what so ever but for reasons unknown to him he was being blamed did they also know about the shadow x the night went on uneventful and then finally morning came when harry was awoken to get ready the thought that he still had to go to court today set down heavily on him they would go he d be trailed and while they were deciding on what to do there everyone in number twelve would be wondering how they could prove that he killed mrs weasley the only thing he had to calm him down now was his necklace the shadow seemed to be the only thing that wasntaccusing him it was the only thing that seemed to be okay with what was going on and didntblame him for what had happened or anything at all for that matter in his dreams he d been alone again in the long hall but no matter how alone he seemed continuously watched he could never see anything but he felt it and not only felt it but he heard it as well shaking his head and trying to clear it harry followed mr weasley into the ministry of magic it was going to be a long morning he knew but eventually he d make it into the court and he d feel even worse he wondered after awhile once they d entered the building if he d be able to fight his way out if he lost the trial it d be possible wouldntit and maybe even the shadow would come out and help him after a few moments he realized they d made their way into the actually court room without his knowing it mr weasley had left and he stood their alone while about 50 people sat staring at him trying to measure him as best they could without thinking harry hand immediately went up to his necklace and he slowly moved forward when fudge bade him to do so he took a seat down in a hard wooden chair with chains all around it he d seen those chains go from limp to around a person within seconds if need be this thought made his stomach knot a bit and he started playing with the necklace more alright then cornelius started naming off people who were to be in the court he was almost finished when dumbledore strolled in past harry and stated that he d be the defense for the witness some of the people in the court were angered by this but dumbledore either didntnotice or didntcare no doubt being the later harry wasntto sure how to react he wanted to thank dumbledore all of a sudden for the necklace but at the same time he felt like getting up and kicking the headmaster while fudge and dumbledore exchanged a few words harry eyes fell on percy whom he d just noticed was in the same room with him percy gave him an evil smirk and then went back to writing notes as though he d never stopped harry wasntcompletely sure what that was about but he wasntsure he wanted to know either his thoughts were broken off a few seconds later when a large chair appeared beside him and dumbledore sat down he wasntreally sure what do or what or think was dumbledore really on his side or was he with voldemort like he d thought not to long ago it ll be alright harry dumbledore whispered and instantly harry felt a bit better the court went on and harry did his best to try to explain what had happen of course no one would let him speak after a long series of buts he finally shot a glare at all of them i was attacked by dementors harry growled his hands beginning to tightly clench into fist the others on the court looked from one another and whispered in hushed hurried tones a dementor ha attacked by something only magical beings can see what an excuse boy fudge laughed as though harry had gone insane dumbledore and a few of the others on the court frowned at this i not lying do you have any proof of this any witnesses fudge asked with a self assured smirk across his face actually yes we do dumbledore answered for harry and the look instantly dropped off fudge face he hadntexpected that harry to was a bit shocked to find out there was a witness he left his gaze fall on the witness and smiled of course there d be a witness hadnthe been saved more or less by mrs figg all of the worry in harry body left him and he now gave fudge an evil look that sent shivers down the minister spine harry was safe and he knew it without even bothering to pay attention to the rest of the hearing harry felt himself drift off into his own mind to where he could now easily make contact with the shadow you knew you wouldntbe convicted if they d tried i d of intervened the shadow mused wrapping its arms around harry harry of course relaxed and everyone else seemed to think this was due to the fact mrs figgs had stepped up to help him no one had to know about the shadow anyway what they didntknow and couldntsee couldnthurt them or could it he asked himself his thoughts drifting back to mrs weasley i didntdo it harry you know i didn t the shadow whispered to him in his mind harry instantly decided the shadow wouldntlie to him that it hadntdone anything to mrs weasley at all i do know who did though it went on tightening its embrace around him he let out a small sigh and closed his eyes relaxing even more he couldnthelp it he felt absolutely safe right now dumbledore was here and the shadow was protecting him he was invincible so who did it harry finally had the mental strength to ask he was answered by a low chuckle and a kiss on the neck if i told you it d hurt you i think i shall keep it to myself for now it mused and finally stopped giving harry a hard time so he could pay attention to the rest of the trial harry shivered and looked up when the sound of a high pitched girl started to speak he blinked a few times making sure he was hearing the voice from the right person he was sure he was looking at a frog not a witch she went on however questioning dumbledore if he was in fact saying it was the ministry fault for the dementor attack as dumbledore gave his answer her gaze fell on harry who she gave a very cold and evil look harry felt the shadow release him and for a moment he thought it d vanished until he saw that the woman speaking started to turn blue she d stopped talking all together even though dumbledore had finished his sentence and had started grabbing at her throat all the members of the court quickly looked to her and tried to find some reason as to why she was grabbing at her own throat they found nothing and seeing no one with any wands out could find no explanation as to why she couldntbreathe no stop harry demanded of the shadow it seemed reluctant to listen but sure enough umbridge was slowly getting her breath back and the shadow rewrapped itself around harry i not listening to you because you have control over me it warned its hand trailing down the side of harry face rather i hate to hear you sound so pitiful it hissed and vanished instantly all the emotions harry had been feeling before came rushing back at him the fears of being utterly alone and being convicted hit him dead on when he tired to think logically that he had a witness that dumbledore was there and he d be fine he remembered that even if he was ron and the others thought he d murdered mrs weasley even if he wasntsent to jail his life would feel like one anyway no doubt the minute they would arrive at hogwarts ron would go on telling everyone how harry had murdered his mother and hermione would do the same wanting to see ron happy and harry punished he d likely be called into trail again and when that happened he d be convicted just because fudge felt like it he took in a deep shaky breath and harry noticed the headmaster still refused to look at him he thinks i murdered mrs weasley too he thought to himself an emotional barrier finally coming up everyone was against him and the one thing that hadntbeen he d gone and made angry harry whole world was once again being turned upside down and there were no handholds this time x harry hadntbeen convicted but it sure didntfeel that way the necklace didnthave the same warm and comforting feeling it usually did and he wondered if maybe the necklace he d been given had one wish in it the case being after that wish was granted obviously his not going to azkaban for the use of underage magic the spirit within it the necklace vanished he let out a small groan and mr weasley noticed that he d finally made it out of the courtroom he looked down at harry with worry clearly written across his face harry tried to smile but it wouldntcome i was cleared of everything he said trying to assure mr weasley everything going to be fine the last part was to convince himself that great mr weasley beamed harry thought you couldnteven tell he d lost his wife earlier that morning they headed up the stairs in silence not quite knowing what to say harry wondered if mr weasley like the others were blaming him for his wife death he was in the room though when it had happened maybe he wouldntblame harry surely he d of heard or saw something but he didnthave the nerve to ask him not so soon both harry and mr weasley stopped dead in their tracks seeing lucius said man turned to look at them a long evil smile crossing over his features as he looked harry up and down well well well patronus potter he said as though it was harry real name harry glared at him but said nothing i see you ve gotten out of another mess how long do you believe your luck will hold out he asked coldly the smile still on his lips harry felt the warmth flow past him and the smirk on lucius face vanished instantly he eyed harry dangerously and then turned to fudge without a word can we go somewhere more private of course fudge led lucius towards the stairs so they could go his office while the shadow came back taking its place once again in harry necklace i refuse to see him harm what mine it hissed inside his mind mr weasley wasntto sure as to what just happened and ushered harry into the lift and the gryffindor following blindly the words didntdo much to harm or insult harry at all he was just too happy to have the shadow back even if it d left him for only a mere few minutes it had felt like it d been gone for over a few hours a few suffocating hours where he d never be able to escape and the only choice he had was darkness no he decided he could never lose the shadow if he did he d end up losing his life as well tbc that took a really long time to update i sorry i trying to get a schedule set up for the
