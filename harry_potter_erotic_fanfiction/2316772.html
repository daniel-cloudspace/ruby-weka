 disclaimer i do not own harry potter or any of the characters places etc found in the harry potter books these belong to j k rowling and various others such as scholastic and bloomsbury in addition the title of this story comes from a quote by william blake thy friendship oft has made my heart to ache do be my enemy for friendship sake i thought that it was appropriate author note i wrote the beginning of this story on a very old computer over the course of a year or two i decided that it would be worth more where other people could read it and constructively criticize it also i am american and i decided that it would be more irritating for you all if i pretended that i wasntwhile writing this so only extremely well known british words are used in this story like mum instead of mom i also decided that it would be more annoying if i did not at least try to write hagrid dialogue in a dialect read review and enjoy do be my enemy for friendship sake bymerlinsbeard chapter 1 loneliness and sympathy we had been best friends for what seemed like forever when i was eleven trying to find an empty seat on the hogwarts express feeling completely out of place it was percy who brought me into the same compartment as his brothers charlie and bill the sixth and seventh years treated us like royalty asking us what house we wanted to be in and telling us everything that we needed to know in order to survive our first week as first years when percy and i were both sorted into gryffindor it was official we would be best friends we got each other through the terrors of being in a strange place with even stranger people and creatures granted it was mainly me who needed help getting through it percy family was made up of wizards i was a muggle born child who had only learned that magic existed when my letter came from hogwarts i was still unsure of what had happened percy started dating penelope i knew that much but what had happened to our friendship that question kept me thinking into the night i couldntjust accept what seemed too un weasley like percy would not just ditch me i sat alone in the common room watching everyone go about his or her own business the sixth years were huddled around the fireplace like always i often wondered if they were all vampires and that why the fire never seemed to overheat them as it did to the rest of us the fifth years were nowhere to be seen no doubt planning some attack on the slytherin common room under the leadership of fred and george the fourth years were doing homework potter and company were doing the same the first and second years had gone to bed already and the seventh years my year wood fan club who cared certainly not me nor percy although percy was nowhere to be seen i reminded myself it wasntsupposed to be like this i thought you re not supposed to be alone during your seventh year this was supposed to be the best year of my life not the worst and so that night was the same as every other night had been for the past few months the first few months of school that year i walked up to the dormitory so i would be alone without the company of everyone else about an hour later the rest of the gryffindor seventh year girls walked into our dormitory i smiled at them and they all returned the favor i didnthate them after all i just couldntlike them and the same was supposed to be true for the four of them laura what are you doing up here cedar treeman asked sweetly her real name was cynthia but the play off her last name fit her better she was strong and the tallest girl in our year but she kept some sort of femininity don t cedar joan creevey said quietly she was soft spoken and considerate sometimes too considerate i often wondered why she wasntin hufflepuff they all knew why i was there all alone all of the sixth and seventh years did no matter what house they were in i was only trying to be polite cedar said heading towards her wardrobe to get her pajamas i know i said looking down laura joan asked would you like to go to hogsmeade with us tomorrow what said the rest of us in the room we can all hang out together the four of us were only going to sit around the three broomsticks anyway it can be the five of us instead joan said smiling there was a slight pause yeah we want you to come tara spencer said walking over and sitting on the edge of my bed just the five of us tara was beautiful and while she knew it she tended just to ignore it i nodded still surprised but happy perhaps i was being set up i thought but i doubted it and i was lonely all right tomorrow then they all smiled and nodded tomorrow became today and the next thing i knew i was walking with the four other seventh years to hogsmeade the walk to hogsmeade is where students had the most privacy there are no paintings or ghosts around and one can easily see if any other students or teachers are within listening distance after we were away from the dementors conversation started i think i going to break up with cedric rose brown said rose was also quite pretty but unlike tara she cared rose was nice but she often came across as quite snobbish what the other three girls asked in unison are you crazy he gorgeous athletic and a hufflepuff tara said exactly he a hufflepuff they re so dull and he only sixteen i need some excitement like who i asked flint rose said smiling broadly the slytherin cedar asked ew cedar told you what she though when she thought it he good looking rose said so is cedric tara said but marcus flint is so controversial i guessed exactly exciting we d be the talk of the school rose said why not date professor lupin he good looking and controversial cedar said the rest of us laughed on second thought leave him alone he mine cedar said you can have lupin if i can have snape rose said unable not to make a face and i get flitwick tara added dumbledore joan said cracking up with the rest of us they all turned to me well rose asked well what you all obviously claimed my first choices i said smiling oh come on just keep away from hagrid and we ll get along fine we all laughed and joked about the professors for a few more minutes before we d exhausted the material and started feeling bad for making fun of people we genuinely liked or at least respected so you think i shouldntbreak up with cedric rose asked to change the subject no it sounds like you should cedar said there was silence for a few minutes and i started feeling the awkwardness of being around these girls outside of hogwarts cedar must have felt it too because she quickly tried to keep the conversation going so we ve fixed rose romantic dilemma who next laura i jumped a little and mentally laughed at myself for thinking that the silence had been awkward i d been hearing about their lives for years after they figured out that i wasntgoing to spread their secrets around hogwarts they began talking openly in the dormitory however it made things easier on all sides to pretend as if i wasntthere my problems never came up sorry no dilemmas to speak of i said trying to be nonchalant come now there must be something worth talking about rose prodded never one to give up on good gossip not really i said trying to think of a new subject not really come on i ve never heard of you dating anyone in the seven years you ve been here after all of the times you ve had to listen to our problems surely there a not really that we can help you with now rose insisted i dontreally want to talk about it i said blushing ahh what did he do to you she asked rose leave her alone joan said he didntdo anything to me well surely it wasntyour fault it always the boy fault rose said ignoring joan glare he died i said quickly there was an uncomfortable silence the summer after our third year i said just to break the silence and thinking that maybe the length of time involved would make them less uneasy dan tara asked she immediately looked sorry for prying yes i said how rose asked cedar hit her lightly on the arm we all know how she whispered not how he died rose whispered back how she was dating a seventh year when we were only going to be fourth years she can hear you joan said almost angrily i was spending the month with percy at the burrow i said you donthave to prove your story laura joan said casting another dirty look at rose i wasntsaying she was lying we all know she was there when it happened i only meant that there a large age difference and no one guessed or knew because of the age gap i said getting angry you donthave to say anything joan said we believe you what not to believe that you were dating the quidditch captain who was three years older than you rose challenged she was quick to meet anger with anger it not a trait i can condemn without being hypocritical i shouldnthave come i said feeling tears come into my eyes and turning to head back to the castle dontgo joan said yeah we want to hear about it cedar said perhaps loneliness makes you stupid perhaps anger does a combination of both certainly must i never would have told them without both not because i didnttrust them i d heard enough about each of them to keep them silent my parents had always wanted to travel but i was born before they could really get the chance so they decided to take a month and see europe laura you donthave to tell us joan started then you ll think i was lying and the lie will be one more thing you pity me for i snapped she looked a little hurt but joined the others in listening so i spent the month with the weasleys mrs weasley didntmind having another person to look after i spent most of my time with percy but percy has always been a workaholic and i started getting bored i started spending more time with the other weasley children especially ginny we spent a lot of time watching the others play quidditch at their pitch behind the house they all love the sport except percy i went back to the pitch to find ginny one day while only dan was practicing he didnthave as much talent as his older brothers or even fred and george but he was excellent at strategy he never thought he was a good enough player to be a chaser for our team thought it was only his brothers that got him on the team he practiced all the time i never knew that cedar said only the weasleys did i think anyway he noticed me watching him and said that if i was going to stay i might as well help him practice he told me to fly around and throw golf balls for him to catch i golf balls cedar asked muggle sport they re about the size of a snitch tara a half blood explained oh sorry cedar said it ok well it only took about a minute for dan to discover that there was a good reason that i always stayed on the ground with ginny while they practiced we had to spend a few hours out of every afternoon for a week teaching me how to fly before i could help him practice at all but i liked talking to him more than i liked quidditch and after a while we talked more than we practiced it sounds romantic joan said smiling i laughed not at all we fought all of the time eventually we figured out what topics to avoid i wasntangry anymore but i was caught up in the story so i continued i knew that i liked him but i just thought of it as a school girl crush on a boy who was older than me then one day i walked out to meet him ginny or whoever was out there i saw him flying around slowly which he usually did when he was working on a new play no one ever interrupted this so i stood there watching him after a few minutes he noticed me standing on the edge of the pitch and flew over he got off his broom leaned over and kissed me i pulled away i hadntbeen expecting it and he d scared me was it your first kiss rose asked yes i was only going to be at the burrow for about another week and in that time dan only kissed me a couple more times the age difference bothered us both a little and we thought it would bother everyone else more so that why no one knows and that why you canttell anyone if one more person knows then the whole school knows and there are five weasleys who dontneed to be reminded of what happened ok all four of them promised quickly and i knew i could trust them so the weasleys dontknow tara asked after a minute there was never a good time to tell them they donttalk about him ever at least not while i around anyway it doesntreally matter anymore we walked the rest of the way to the three broomsticks in silence four of us claimed a table near the back while cedar ordered five butterbeers at the counter she rejoined us a few minutes later madame rosmerta followed her carefully balancing a tray with our drinks she placed them in the center of the table before walking away quickly the three broomsticks was always extremely busy on hogsmeade weekends the five of us began to drink without talking you know joan said after a few minutes there no reason why you canthang out with us at hogwarts you donthave to seclude yourself just because thanks but no thanks i said coldly upon seeing her hurt expression i added it never been you four you know that you understand no i don t joan said but after that she didnttry to push the issue slowly the conversation reached a normal level and after about an hour and a few butterbeers each we were laughing and having a great time you re messing with us rose said no i was looking out a window with dave and a big cat and dog went into the whomping willow i have no idea how they did it all i know is that one second the willow was whomping and the next second it frozen and two animals are walking into the tree cedar said you ve been obsessed with that old tree forever when potter and percy little brother hit it with that car you cried tara said i didn t cedar protested did too the rest of us said laughing so i was worried about it poor thing had a sling and everything cedar said suddenly very somber we all laughed even harder so there you are we ve been looking for you four i stopped laughing immediately the other girls looking over my head and smiling a little gradually grew silent as well i thought we were all going to check out zonko s change of plans cedar said i stood up and brushed some nonexistent dirt off my cloak i have some homework to finish up back at the castle i ll see you i said smiling at the girls and ignoring the boys beside me where percy oliver shut up rose said we ll walk back with you laura tara said standing as well we were heading back to the castle too adam still tara boyfriend said he had never truly caught onto the fact that not everyone got along and most people liked him for that no i still need to buy something at i dontknow i have to buy something mark jordan joan boyfriend said trying to ease some tension now mark what kind of men would we be if we didntwalk the girls back to the castle men i muttered wood just smiled sweetly making me even angrier unless of course you were waiting for percy and penelope he said to me let just go if we re going to ok joan asked standing and giving wood one of her looks he stepped back and motioned for the girls to walk in front of him i walked out of the bar before they could catch up and ducked inside of honeydukes after about five minutes i made my way back into the street hey laura i turned towards the voice it was percy he jogged up to me hi i said smiling broadly i talked to percy in between classes and at some meals but it had been a while since i d been around him outside of or after school hey listen have you seen penelope i lost her in flourish and blotts he said looking in both directions down the street i sighed no i haven t oh ok well maybe she went to the three broomsticks then see you he said walking off i drew my cloak around me and started back towards the castle alone about halfway there i heard someone call my name again i turned to see professor hagrid and smiled to greet him ello laura ow are ya i fine i lied really ya seemed like ya were mopin i turned on my fake smile that i d been using more and more often i just taking my time getting back to the castle how re you oh well i ve been better i nodded so have i want to talk about it there nothing to talk about really it was his turn to nod ya know sometimes ya just ave to play with th cards yer dealt what me i werentmeant to be a professor nonsense you love it i can tell yes but the students arentenjoyin themselves i didntanswer at first look i know malfoy incident shook you up maybe you started off too big with the younger students right they should start with less dangerous creatures but that no reason not to work with more interesting creatures with your older students right his smile brightened yer right i suppose i think so i think yer right i gonna go back and work on somethin he said walking faster which for hagrid was pretty fast thanks you re welcome i said although i doubt he heard me once i reached the gates i ate a piece of chocolate and hurried through the gates and towards the castle when i got back to the common room the rest of the seventh years were already there in their normal place near the center of the room joan stood up when she saw me and intercepted me before i could reach the door to the stairway leading to the dormitory i sorry she said i tried to say something but she cut me off not for wood i should have said that i was sorry about daniel i shook my head i shouldnthave told you in the first place i usually dontjust ramble like that you should have told someone sooner tell who i asked quickly any one of us would have gladly listened she said we donthate you i know i said a tad bit defensively and you donthate us no then why not come over with me i donthate you but oliver why not just let it go it ancient history she said not to us but it stupid i shook my head i not the only one you d have to convince it complicated you know that everyone knows that but no one not me not percy and not wood understands how complicated it is then let it go she said why isolate yourself i have homework joan i appreciate the thought but i dontwant anyone pity except my own i ll see you later i said dodging past her and hurrying upstairs author note i do my best to make dialogue sound believable it was more difficult in this chapter because i was trying to introduce the three main conflicts in the story the conflicts become more connected later there no real cliffhanger here it just a natural chapter break so i ll put the cliffhanger here voice over what did percy and oliver fight about that joan thinks is so stupid what happened to daniel weasley and what is the scariest thing in the forbidden forest an unknown creature or laura enemy some answers coming up in chapter 2 end of voice over author note i was faced with a very interesting dilemma while writing this chapter how in the hell would laura and oliver act around each other after telling each other how they felt i was stuck at this point in the story for a long time and then i realized that my uncertainty might help me write their uncertainty about the same thing yes this chapter gets cute perhaps too cute but i ve made sure to give laura and oliver plenty of hell over it i hope you all enjoy reading it sorry for the delay in posting you re all awesome for waiting please review support can only help me write the next chapters didntthink i could write an author note without a plea for reviews did you chapter 10 awkwardness and anger the next morning i woke up early as usual to get ready for the day before the bathroom got too busy i walked down to the common room to sit in front of the fire gather my thoughts and wait for someone to walk down to breakfast with when i got down there i found someone else sleeping in my place oliver i asked quietly bending down and shaking him a little he woke up and sat up quickly oh it just you yeah just me i said who were you expecting oliver motioned for me to sit down next to him i did keeping a little more space between us than a part of me wanted but i felt just a little awkward around him i was expecting percy percy with a long sharp knife i laughed are you that sure he took what i said that badly yes he said he raised hell when he came upstairs last night after you talked to him he woke up all of the seventh years by yelling at me i think the sixth years might have heard him too he yelled at you in the middle of the night i asked oliver yawned said i should have left you alone and that the two of you have gone through enough in the past five years and that you didntneed me making things worse you ve made things better oliver smiled and put a hand on my knee that what i said that also why i slept on the couch down here last night i laughed again though i tried not to it isntthat funny this sofa wasntmade to sleep on oliver said rubbing his neck i sorry i said still smiling i dontsee why you had to sleep downstairs though you two have never fought before never in the middle of the night the day after the other seventh years stayed up partying the rest of the boys said that if one of us didntgo downstairs both of us were banned from the room for as long as we werentgetting along i decided that one night on the couch beat spending the rest of the year down here with percy i nodded i didntthink he would say anything to you last night i thought it could at least wait until morning oliver yawned again taking his hand off of my knee to cover his mouth we said some things to each other that needed to be said and now that those things have been said we can go back to ignoring each other he had no right to get as angry as he did i said getting angry myself he shown very little interest in me for over a year and then all of a sudden he interested in what i doing again no he interested in what you re doing that what it is i leaned back into the sofa laura oliver said you knew that percy was going to get mad i knew percy was going to get mad i knew that you would probably get a little mad at percy but i also thought you might be at least a little happy i am happy i said quickly i smiled i canteven get as angry at percy as i should be oliver shook his head but smiled i had the same problem that why i was the one sleeping in the common room last night i dontthink the seventh years could have made percy do anything he didntwant to do last night i nodded completely sure that oliver was right there was a pause so how did the girls take the news oliver asked about us yes oh pretty well they were a little surprised but not surprised enough not to guess what was going on yesterday i think joan seen it coming for a while did you know that it was her fault that we were paired together for that project in transfiguration months ago oliver looked over at me what do you mean she put mcgonagall up to it probably told her a sob story about how i was miserable and that if i could forgive you i could have more company anyway mcgonagall bought it i didntknow that i guess i ll have to thank them both for interfering in others business he said taking my hand i blushed is something wrong oliver asked looking at me concernedly i shook my head no i said honestly you re acting strangely he said squeezing my hand a little i smiled and blushed a little more i making you uncomfortable oliver said laughing i laughed too yes i admitted why he asked still laughing i have no idea i said quickly i just have no idea how to treat you now oliver shrugged the same as you always have treated me well maybe with a few differences he said grinning a few differences i said grinning back a little mischievously such as calling you disgustingly cute nicknames or should i giggle whenever you say anything or write your name all over my notes with little hearts around it oliver shook his head smiling i wouldntmind my name being all over your notes but the other two things would get annoying i forced myself to giggle he laughed wholeheartedly what in the hell was that i started laughing normally again and leaned in towards him resting my head on his shoulder i not sure i dontthink i ve ever made that noise before i not the giggling type no you aren t he said wrapping his arm around my shoulders but at least you re loosening up around me again what that supposed to mean i not standoffish around you i said he laughed took his arm back and scooted away a little he clasped his hands and put them in his lap you re not making me uncomfortable oliver he said in what shockingly sounded very much like how i talk hey i said hitting the side of his leg with my hand he kept laughing but stopped acting like me that wasntvery nice i said smiling to show i was kidding no it wasn t i sorry he said still laughing that it you re sorry what else do you want me to say he joked i never said i wanted you to say anything he raised his eyebrows oh he asked leaning towards me you two are disgusting adam said oliver and i turned quickly to see adam and mark standing behind the couch looking down at us the two of them looked like it was killing them to not laugh and they quickly gave up trying not to how long have you been standing there oliver asked with more than a little irritation in his voice long enough for you two to never live that conversation down mark said still laughing heartily i sorry adam said that it you re sorry mark asked making his voice higher to mimic me what else do you want me to say adam asked hamming up his acting as much as humanly possible i dontwant you to say anything mark said forgetting to raise the pitch of his voice halfway through the two boys broke into hysterics again i blushed but couldnthelp laugh a little oliver was laughing too honestly we know that people say some shall we say sappy things when they first start dating to deal with some awkwardness but damn mark said will you two go away oliver asked still laughing adam raised his hands like he was surrendering and mark just laughed sure mate we just came over to warn you warn me about what oliver asked warn you that percy doesntappear to have slept off any of his anger if anything it might have gotten worse i didntthink it could get much worse but well perhaps you should just stay clear of him for a while mark said maybe i should try to talk to him i said probably not the best idea mark answered your name possibly had worse words following it than wood did i raised my eyebrows in surprise worse than oliver s thanks for that oliver said i looked over at him and smiled sorry he just smiled back i canttake this adam said shaking his head at us mark laughed we just wanted you to know wood he grinned i sorry that it you re sorry adam asked picking up the script immediately what else do you want me to say i dontwant you to say anything the two left the room laughing i will never hear the end of that oliver said blushing a little i laughed a little under my breath i sorry they ll move on soon enough i sure only when we give them something even more embarrassing to use oliver said i cantwait i said laughing and putting my hand in his he smiled and quickly looked over his shoulder i canteither but donttell anyone that he said quietly i leaned in and kissed him he pulled away more quickly than i d expected we probably shouldntbe like this when percy comes downstairs he said quickly might make things worse for all of us i dontreally want to sleep down here again i nodded you re right it time for breakfast anyway we walked downstairs hand in hand some people we passed in the hall smiled and then started whispering when they thought we couldnthear them anymore how long do you think it ll be before everyone knows i asked about an hour he said that long you think i asked i was guessing conservatively he answered i nodded we walked a bit farther in silence it wasntan awkward silence but it wasnta comfortable one either i quickly came up with another topic you never told me about letting the golden snitch go into that room oliver face lit up more than it had all morning no i didn t did i i had just fallen asleep after all of the festivities were ended by mcgonagall a house elf woke me up at dawn to tell me i needed to go to the quidditch stadium professor dumbledore and all of the heads of the houses were waiting in the center of the field professor dumbledore congratulated the team and me and handed me the snitch that harry had caught the six of us walked to the side of the stadium it turns out there a faster way into that room than through the locker rooms we walked through one of the walls in the stadium and directly into the room with the snitches professor mcgonagall lit her wand but that was the only light i could only see slight shimmers of light from the snitches we all stood there for a few minutes i wasntsure what i was supposed to do finally professor dumbledore smiled kindly and said let it go so i did could you see it fly away in the dim light i asked watching him remember the experience instead of watching where i was going no oliver said pulling on my arm a little so i wouldntrun into a student passing by i could feel it fly around me once before joining the other snitches but it was too dark to watch it oh that too bad oliver shook his head i know what it looked like i smiled up at him and he pulled my arm again so i would avoid a door that had opened be careful he said kindly why i haventrun into anything i said turning my head to watch where i was going anyway you haventhit anything because i watching where you re going for you oliver said jokingly while watching me i pulled on his arm and he barely avoided running headlong into professor dumbledore dumbledore nodded and smiled while passing he started whistling a tune i didntrecognize as he continued down the hall be careful i mocked i have never almost run into anything in my entire life oliver said sounding genuinely surprised and how does it feel to be as unobservant as the rest of us for once i asked unobservant i ve never been so focused on one thing either he said i turned blushing and smiled up at him where is oliver and what have you done with him oliver laughed i have no idea thank god mark and adam werenthere to hear that though we ll be sure to pass it along you must be kidding oliver said as we stopped walking and cedar and rose ran into our backs honestly how could you not know we were there rose asked grinning at the two of us when we decided to turn around and face them they were never so focused on one thing remember cedar asked not you too i said dontyou all have better things to do than eavesdrop on our conversations it creepy honestly i take it adam and mark overheard one of your conversations this morning cedar asked unfortunately oliver mumbled rose smiled even more well we wontmake you relive the experience i sure the boys will pass along that information oliver smiled back sarcastically i must say i didntreally believe the two of you were together until this walk down to breakfast rose said as the four of us started walking again you really didntknow we were following cedar asked no we didn t i answered have you kissed her yet rose asked oliver jokingly oliver laughed and turned red that really none of your business is it of course he has cedar said can we change the subject i asked quickly he has hasnthe cedar asked seriously go away i said laughing and holding my palm up to my forehead wincing as if the conversation was hurting me physically you better have wood i have merlin oliver said i could hear the embarrassment in his voice i took my hand away from my face good cedar said with finality and i was thrilled to be done with that conversation the four of us walked into the great hall and oliver and i reluctantly joined the other seventh years joan and tara had gone down before even adam and mark to our amazement and relief our friends didntgive us much of a hard time mark and adam only ran through their script of oliver and my conversation twice and there were a few funny looks but that was all everything else seemed relatively normal in the group i was relieved i could deal with the slight awkwardness around oliver i had been expecting percy wrath it was nice to have some stability with the rest of the seventh years about halfway through breakfast percy walked into the great hall with penelope our section of the table grew silent and the half of the table facing percy watched the two take a seat fortunately oliver and i were on the side with our backs to him percy didntstop to chat or yell how he look i asked quietly unable to pretend like nothing had happened um well joan started like the two of you were nonexistent more or less cedar said bluntly he looked completely normal happy until he passed our section of the table then he just looked rather apathetic i raised my eyebrows and sighed well i wasntexpecting any differently i guess he seems to have calmed down since this morning adam said cheerfully i shook my head no if percy not saying anything it means that he more angry at me than if he were in my face yelling obscenities i dontknow he seemed pretty pissed last night when he was in wood face yelling obscenities adam said it different i said quickly oliver nodded he hates me is what she means the silent treatment is reserved for the people he actually likes how nice of him mark said we laughed a little and moved into new normal conversations the school day was normal yet different it was the same old monday routine arithmacy transfiguration lunch potions and defense against the dark arts nothing remarkable occurred in any class but little changes made that monday seem different from any previous monday that year oliver walked me to arithmacy before going to his own muggle studies class people in the halls would smile at the two of us with the occasional glare coming from a fourteen or fifteen year old girl professor mcgonagall gave us a genuine smile when she saw oliver sitting next to me holding my hand at lunch mark and adam tried to convince us seventh years that they too had seen the relationship coming all along no one bought it in potions snape made a snide remark about gryffindor newest couple and how hogwarts relationships rarely work when the sixth and seventh years who were apathetic about oliver and i dating heard that our relationship pissed professor snape off enough for him to say something these sixth and seventh years became much more outwardly supportive of the whole thing not that oliver and i needed other people to support the relationship but the fact that they did helped our uneasiness that day professor lupin in defense against the dark arts class probably made more of a deal out of oliver and i dating than any other professor perhaps with the exception of hagrid who beamed whenever he saw us for weeks he smiled much like professor mcgonagall had when he saw us sitting beside each other our lesson that day was on a few counter curses that could be used while dueling he had oliver and i demonstrate the counter curses for the class to prepare oliver and laura for their future minor domestic disputes we knew to take his teasing in good spirits it was slightly easier for me to do so i would have defeated oliver in each duel had the duels been real oliver continued to claim for weeks that he d let me win the duels i always responded by telling him that it would be easier for everyone if he learned to admit when he was defeated by me because it would happen often that evening after dinner i tried to do homework for a couple of hours it was difficult to concentrate on my studies because people kept interrupting to comment on how they were glad to see oliver and me happy again laura i looked up from my transfiguration book clearly showing my frustration i sorry oliver said i didntmean to bother you i shook my head and smiled not at all i was expecting another well wisher that i didntreally want to talk to i take it you dontmind talking to me then oliver said pulling out a chair but not sitting in it most of the time i said grinning would you like to get out of gryffindor go take a walk perhaps oliver asked quickly i checked my muggle watch it already after curfew oliver only by about fifteen minutes it not like we re getting anything accomplished people have been interrupting our studying all evening yes but if we get caught oliver interrupted me with his laughter if we get caught then this is probably the only day we ll ever be able to get away with it think about it if someone catches us then we ll plead temporary stupidity send some puppy love looks at each other and act cute no one will want to ruin our good day except snape or percy i said percy not monitoring the halls tonight and we ll stay away from the dungeons does snape ever leave the dungeons i shrugged i ve never seen him upstairs before but i dontusually wander the halls at night the truth was that i didntmind following rules if i absolutely had to break a rule i would but otherwise i stayed within the guidelines maybe percy had rubbed off on me a little bit the thought that percy may have been influencing my thinking made me seriously consider oliver argument he was probably correct if we did get caught that night most people would probably look the other way oliver could see that i d made up my mind and walked around the table he took my hand and pulled me up all right i said sighing just let me put my books upstairs i dontthink anyone will take your homework i looked at him curiously why are you in such a hurry to leave the common room i looked around is percy in here or something oliver laughed but just barely no and even if he were it wouldntchase me out of the room i just we haventhad much time alone today everyone been too interested in us to give us any time to ourselves i smiled and blushed a little oliver smiled back and i followed him silently out of the common room leaving my books where they were for several minutes we walked slowly hand in hand through the upper floors of hogwarts for the first time i did not feel awkward around oliver while there was silence i knew that we still had things to talk about but i also knew that we could talk about these things there was no rush and we had had enough conversations that we didnthave to share every thought with each other anymore we already knew in some basic form what the other person was thinking i dontthink i ve been in this hallway oliver said after we d been out of the common room for almost half an hour i used to have to walk through here on my way to the divination tower oliver looked down at me smiling you did take divination didntyou i d forgotten that largest waste of time of my life i said i have absolutely no sense of the future professor trelawney said i was too wrapped up in the past to be able to see into the future maybe she was right i doubt it though i seriously wonder if trelawney was ever able to see anything meaningful in the future i dontthink many people believe she can see into the future i suppose dumbledore would never have hired her if she didnthave some talent though i know of one person who placed some faith in professor trelawney i said smirking slightly who oliver asked rose i said trying not to laugh rose our rose she doesntseem like the type to fall for that kind of thing she is when she likes what she hears oliver stopped walking and since i was still holding his hand i stopped as well and faced him i have a feeling this is going to be a pretty good story i d like to focus more on the story than where we re going he said leading me over to a windowsill at the end of the small hallway were we in the two of us put our weight against the sill all right let hear it i laughed well rose needed a letter of recommendation and professor trelawney always liked rose because rose actually pretended like she cared what we were learning about in that class rose was good at making up fortunes that not only sounded believable but were based in the lessons we had she got an outstanding on o w l s in that class we re not sure why she didnttake n e w t levels of the class anyway i went upstairs with rose and tara so rose could ask for a letter of recommendation professor trelawney was pleased to be asked she said she couldntwrite one without looking at rose palm though rose agreed of course professor trelawney looked at her palm and said a few things that i dontremember about the head and life lines when professor trelawney reached the heart line she gasped professor trelawney said that it appeared that rose was in a time of unrequited love at the moment but that very soon this love would be returned oliver laughed i nodded rose wouldntlet us leave until she d gotten professor trelawney to tell her that rose and flint would be happily married with two children and a dog professor trelawney thankfully told rose what she wanted to hear i would have hated to see what rose would have done to the poor woman if trelawney would have said that rose and flint had no future together i think it would have been rather amusing to watch i laughed i actually thought that rose was losing hope in anything ever working with flint but now her hope is back as strong as ever i ve heard rumors that it may not be hopeless oliver said i looked up in him with surprise you mean flint is actually coming around well i dontknow if i d say that i d say it would be closer to say that flint is starting to give in it pretty obvious to the rest of the school that rose will never give up the two were seen walking around the grounds yesterday afternoon you re kidding i said impressed of course the rumors did include the part about rose attaching herself to flint with a charm but he didntbreak the charm for over an hour he probably couldntfigure out how i said oliver laughed i afraid you might be right but let not give up hope if rose hasn t i smiled up at him that was sweet then i take it back he said he put his hands on my waist and pulled me closer my stomach flipped and i felt myself blushing furiously oliver was nice enough not to say anything about it he leaned down to kiss me i closed my eyes and tilted my head up towards him oliver must not have seen my move my head he ended up kissing my chin the two of us leaned away from each other quickly i looked up at him both of us were clearly bright red now i missed he said simply taking his hands off my waist his tone of voice and face made me start laughing yes you did i said trying to match his simplicity he started laughing too you arentwilling to take any of the responsibility he teased i shook my head no i believe i shirk responsibility quite well and dontintend on stopping now well what are you going to do when we graduate and you have to take some responsibility he was kidding but my mind still registered it as a valid question i dontknow i said honestly oliver just smiled kindly i dontknow either i dontreally like to think about what going to happen after hogwarts i said surely you ve thought about it a little we re all on career paths have been since our fifth year after we talked to professor mcgonagall he said well yes i admitted turning away from him and looking out the window i want to work for the daily prophet but i dontlike to think about what i ll do if i dontget a job there you ve applied oliver asked kindly last year i confirmed and i ve set up an interview for a few days after graduation then i sure you have nothing to worry about i looked over at him and smiled he had also turned to look out of the window it wasnta great view this window looked out at another wall of hogwarts of course the window wasntmeant to show people anything spectacular this wasnta place people normally stopped it was a hallway used to get from one part of the castle to another and the window let in light adequately enough for that i afraid i ll worry about it until i know for sure either way i never knew that what you wanted to do oliver said perhaps a little to himself i never told you i said i never asked i never asked you what you wanted to do with your life after graduation either i said he looked at me and laughed a little you re right i knew what you wanted to do i didntsay anything how do you know i was right i knew what you were thinking but i still never have asked about your plans so there no need to feel bad about asking about mine have you tried out for any teams no oliver said madame hooch told me that there were scouts from a few teams in britain here at the last game not necessarily for me mind you for any sixth and seventh years perhaps but they must have noticed the captain of the winning team i said happy for him he smiled i hope so i ll find out soon enough but what about you what do you want to do for the prophet i shrugged i have no idea i ve just always wanted to work for that paper it where most british wizards get their news and i knew a long time ago that if i couldntmake the news i wanted to at least spin it the way i wanted oliver laughed so you want to write not necessarily everyone who works for the paper can spin the news even the people who decide the layout can influence how people see the stories that true i suppose professor mcgonagall told me that my flexibility would help me or my lack of commitment to one part of the field would hurt me i ve been hoping that the daily prophet will see things in any way that will help me ultimately it will all depend on my n e w t s oliver sighed my back up plan does if i dontmake any quidditch team then i ll try to join the ministry like my dad you dontseem to keen on the idea i said carefully oliver shrugged i dontthink the back up plan ever sounds that appealing that why it plan b right i laughed a little under my breath makes sense and if i do make a team and can make a career out of quidditch eventually i ll have to retire from that and get a real job then the ministry of magic can become plan a he smiled but i ll admit that i d like to keep that part of my life farther into the future than at the end of this school year i didntsay anything it kind of scary isntit oliver asked after a few minutes the future yes it terrifying let try not to think about it for a while longer i said smiling to show that i wasnttoo serious he put his arm around my waist we still have a couple months to stay under hogwarts protection yes i agreed i leaned toward him and smiled to myself hogwarts had always offered a sense of refuge especially my fourth year when i could escape from the previous summer by diving into my school work like i never had before then hogwarts and the people in it had offered me a future by educating me now hogwarts and the people there made the present feel safe and protected me from the future this is a horrible view oliver said i laughed you picked the window not me i turned away from the window and toward oliver fair point oliver said he turned me around slowly so that my back was to the window and he took a few steps back that a little better i laughed and shook my head oliver laughed too that was a horrible line yes i said i trying he said shrugging trying to what he shook his head and laughed a little more i have no idea i guess the truth is i not entirely sure how to act around you anymore either i sighed i think you had it right this morning act like you always have with a few differences such as he asked smirking making me answer that question again i smirked back well for one thing you could work on your aim a bit he laughed and blushed a little but he didntmiss when he kissed me again after a few minutes oliver stood back a little and laughed i think i like this difference i laughed too i glad i said jokingly patting him on the arm i caught a glimpse of my watch i didntthink i had seen the time correctly so i looked more carefully it really late oliver i dontthink even we could get out of trouble now he nodded let head back then he took my hand and we made our way quickly but quietly back to gryffindor tower without running into anyone patrolling the hallways the fact that we d spent so long out after hours without getting caught made me question the security at school a little but the thought passed quickly that night i just didntcare much about whether anyone who didntbelong could get into the castle without being noticed when we got back to the common room it was empty i walked over and gathered up my books i hadntfinished my homework but i could get what needed to be done the next morning oliver walked me over to the door leading to the girls dormitories perhaps needlessly but i didntmind good night oliver i said quietly before kissing him lightly on his cheek sweet dreams laura he responded opening the door and then shutting it softly behind me i smiled to myself and walked upstairs author note hooray for 2 a m i ve been so nervous about this chapter that i put off writing it for about a year i probably could have put off the end of this chapter another day but i like writing while no one is awake this was a very hard chapter to write my plans for it changed completely while i was writing it i ended up deciding that the characters plans for the future fit in with their conversation here better than the conversation that i originally intended to go into this chapter that means i have to craft the next chapter around that other conversation which means that it might take me a little while again the truth is that i had forgotten how long it takes to write even one rather simple conversation i try not to think about how many hours must have gone into the part of this story i wrote last year or sometime near last year thank you all for waiting for the past few weeks for this chapter you re all marvelous simply marvelous thanks especially to marie dantes for looking over this chapter for me and offering moral support go check out her story harry potter and the lightning bond the story follows this missing gryffindor fifth years and contains clever clues leading up to the revelation of what the lightning bond is it got a good characterization of professor dumbledore gives the weasley twins the attention they deserve and has an amusing original main character andrea it under my favorite stories if you want an easy way to reach it coming up in the next chapter i think percy still pretty pissed which angers laura quite a bit and oliver has been worrying for months now about something that laura told him review pretty pretty please with sugar on top review this story d author note it been a while since the last chapter thank you very much for your patience chapter 11 potions and epiphanies the next morning i got up even earlier than usual so i could finish the homework i had neglected the night before i was a morning person but even morning people dontenjoy getting up before the time they normally do nevertheless i immediately dismissed the thought every time i told myself that had i not gone on a walk with oliver i wouldnthave had to get up so early there would be plenty of opportunities in my life to get a full night sleep after half an hour of transfiguration and forty minutes of potions homework the common room finally began to liven up as much as it can liven up at eight on a tuesday morning i closed my potions book and looked towards the door leading to the boys dormitories just in time to see oliver walk into the common room i left my books on the sofa and walked over to meet him he greeted me with a half awake smile and a short kiss i was happy not to find you sleeping in the common room this morning i said grinning oliver laughed not as happy as i am that you didn t he looked at me carefully you dontlook like you got much sleep i got up early to finish some homework oh i sorry i wouldnthave asked you to go on a walk dontworry about it i dontregret walking with you instead of reading about transfiguration i lost track of my train of thoughts as i saw percy walk out of the stairway he looked over at oliver and me and kept walking now more resolutely i focused my attention back on oliver trying to appear as if i didntrealize percy was in the room after percy passed us i frowned a little time for breakfast i think oliver said gently taking my hand absolutely i said looking him in the eyes and making an effort to forget about my problems with percy only to find that doing so wasntso difficult i gave oliver a genuine smile and we walked for the second time hand in hand down to breakfast i spent most of my free time over the next week with oliver unlike much of our relationship up to that point that week cannot be defined by one or two conversations partially because we didntspend a lot of that time talking ironically the same thing could be said about percy and me percy was continuing the silent treatment and i did my best not to make that difficult for him i mainly tried to ignore percy which wasntdifficult since he was spending most of his time with penelope or in the library when i couldntavoid percy i ignored him i found it hard to really care about percy or my own anger towards percy when i wasntnear him my mind was on other things and for the first time in such a long time i was happy with how things were even if things werentperfect about ten days after i told percy how i felt about oliver percy silent treatment started to break down as most people who have suffered such a treatment before know once the silence is broken you rather wish it hadntbeen i had spent my evening in the library going over transfiguration notes from the previous year i reached the point where if i had read one more word of my notes i might have beaten my head against the table to distract myself from the pain of dying of boredom on my way back into the common room i almost literally ran into percy the two of us stood still looking at each other for a few seconds before percy stepped past me just when i was sure he was going to keep walking he turned five points off of gryffindor for breaking curfew last week he said calmly i was too surprised that he had spoken to me to respond percy took advantage of the silence and left quickly had i been a bit less angry it might have occurred to me to chase after him and perform whatever curse i thought of first instead i stood still murmuring words that my mum still wontallow me to use in her presence and trying to figure out how percy knew i had broken curfew it took me longer to figure it out than it should have percy and oliver did share a room and the three of us were in the same house after all my shock wore off quickly and my anger became less blatant i walked over and joined the rest of the seventh years who were sitting in our usual spot near the center of the common room what happened adam asked not about to pretend that the group hadntnoticed the small scene that had just occurred he just took five points away from gryffindor because i broke curfew last week i said obviously still more surprised than i had thought he took five points away from his own house rose asked i ve done it before joan said i looked at her surprised yet again not because she d taken points away from gryffindor before but because she was a prefect and i had completely forgotten that it not that he took away points from gryffindor it that he took them away from me i said focusing on the real issue again well mark said look at the bright side at least he talking to you again that progress right the rest of the seventh years laughed and even i smiled after several seconds i sat by oliver and joined in on the conversations my anger fading quickly that pretty much how the next two weeks went gradually percy stopped ignoring oliver and me instead of silence we got to enjoy occasional snide comments at first the comments were directed mainly at oliver who would say something back and move on then percy started directing his comments at me at first my surprise at being targeted by percy prevented me from standing up for myself once the comments stopped catching me by surprise i started coming up with comebacks some of them were pretty good much to the enjoyment of adam and mark who critiqued each exchange between percy and me and declared a winner the two of them kept score on a piece of parchment titled the war in the corridors laura vs percy i was usually narrowly ahead of percy to be fair i did have two good coaches who were also the judges and my friends each time percy would say something to me i would get upset but my anger quickly faded once percy left oliver tried to talk me out of my anger at first only to learn that i got over it faster if neither of us mentioned it i dontmean to make it sound as if these incidents occurred very frequently percy wasntgoing out of his way just so he could throw an insult at me in fact the two of us still generally tried to avoid each other class and meals made avoidance slightly difficult and at those times we sometimes exchanged a few words at the most this happened twice per day in all honesty at all other times it was not an issue i wasntbrooding over fighting with percy at all hours if percy was out of sight or at least out of earshot he was out of mind i still spent most of my time with oliver and the two of us avoided the subject of percy which we found surprisingly easy to do only weeks before the two of us had been worried that our relationship would always be defined by our fight the fight didnteven come up often anymore we talked about the past but we focused on individual events that had occurred instead of on how our relationship had been at the time hey gorgeous oliver said as i joined the seventh years one night after completing an assignment hello beautiful i said back smiling oh my god adam said looking up deliver us from this evil most of us laughed we were kidding oliver said i sat down next to him on a sofa and he put his arm around my waist i thought that was obvious when i called you beautiful i said smirking up at him oliver grinned back ughck adam articulated tara hit him playfully i wish we were still more like them she said smiling to show she wasntentirely serious we ve been in love way too long for that adam said grinning up at her merlin get a room rose said smirking at adam anyway oliver and i are hardly ever like that around you anymore no which is a shame tara said joan nodded in agreement i thought it was cute i sighed but just barely a part of me missed it too most of me however was glad to have the normal oliver back he didntsay the cute things as often as he had when we started dating and he almost never said those things around other people yet he also treated me differently than he had right after we d started dating most of the awkwardness was gone i didntturn bright red whenever he so much as touched my hand and he didntsay sappy things whenever he didntknow what else to say we were figuring out the differences in our relationship that had given us trouble at first something wrong oliver said quietly as the rest of the seventh years kept talking not at all i said leaning my head against his shoulder the next week was dominated by school almost everyone seemed to realize that there was only one month until the seventh years had to take n e w t s which were one week before school ended the teachers responded to this realization by increasing the amount of material we were covering and decreasing the amount of time we spent on each lesson the seventh years were scared into actually taking the assignments seriously and into furiously going over old material the rest of the school knew enough to leave the seventh years alone halfway through that week i had the most memorable potions class i had during my seven years at hogwarts stress from the end of the year had put most people in the school in worse than normal moods this of course meant that snape had to be twice as mean as normal in order to keep up appearances at the beginning of the class professor snape told us about the properties of the epiphany potion which basically clears one thinking oftentimes resulting in quite bright ideas the sorting hat was supposedly the result of such a potion snape went on to say almost cheerfully which was always a horrible sign that the potion is extremely difficult to make it requires at least two people to make it because many of its ingredients need to be prepared while the potion itself is being carefully made the potion requires a great deal of teamwork as all students know as the amount of teamwork needed to do a class project increases so does the likelihood that the teacher will choose the teams interestingly this is fred and george second law of school sucks all of us always knew when snape was about to assign partners he would get a certain look on his face that only appeared when he was about to try to make someone potions experience more miserable than it already was unfortunately he was looking directly at me when this look appeared i wasntsurprised snape least favorite type of person was someone who had been unhappy in the past and by some miracle was actually enjoying life debman and weasley may work together today i believe he said grinning i generally avoid grouping friends together but today i ll make an exception i smiled sarcastically at him and grabbed my notes and book bag before making my way over to percy table snape continued pairing people together making as many gryffindors unhappy as possible even if this meant making slytherins unhappy as well no one argued with him if snape had taught us nothing else in seven years he did teach us that in his classes our pleas for fairness would only be met with points taken away from gryffindor or detention i sat down next to percy and looked over the notes we had just taken on the potion and the directions in the book you should prepare it you re better at making potions than i am i said seeing that the potion was indeed quite difficult percy started setting up his cauldron no need for niceties perhaps being paired up with someone in a class has worked out well for you before it unlikely it will again just shut up and let do the damned assignment i said quietly if for no other reason just so we dontmake snape day better percy and i gathered all of the ingredients we would need and the two of us prepared all of the ingredients that could be prepared before the potion was actually started then percy got started and i kept chopping and grinding various things into tiny pieces and powders the two of us ignored each other as much as we could every now and then percy would ask if an ingredient was done i would point he would take whatever he d been asking for and we d go back to pretending we were sitting at lab tables in separate countries other people in the room were having more problems getting along than percy and i were almost all of the ingredients had one thing in common they required longer amounts of time to prepare than the people with this job actually had about every three minutes someone could be heard snapping at his or her partner snape quickly disarmed the only slytherin actually to draw his wand on his partner not that cedar needed snape protection she had already brought her potions book down over the boy head snape didntpunish either of them he just handed the slytherin his wand and cast a warning look at the partners is the liverwort shredded percy asked blandly um i finished as quickly as i could and handed it to him near the end of the lab all of the people preparing the ingredients were behind the point where they needed to be minor spats could be heard in every part of the room but no one was listening to anyone else problems percy and i were the only two not arguing verbally we satisfied ourselves with all of the unforgiving looks we could muster until oh shit percy said loudly i looked up from the plant i was grinding into a paste our potion was bubbling intensely and started to spill over onto the table i moved the other ingredients off the table and stepped away from the potion what did you do i asked i did exactly what the directions told me to do percy snapped you were the one not preparing the ingredients well enough well they seemed to have passed your inspection so i canttake all of the credit percy turned to look at me angrily i did notice the dragonstail root wasntchopped into small enough pieces and the elf fingernails werentground finely enough and if you knew then why in the hell didntyou say anything i asked my voice starting to get louder i turned my body to face him directly i didntwant to hurt your feelings he said his eyes flashing and his voice getting quiet hurt my feelings since when do you care about my feelings i have always cared percy said immediately sensing that the topic had changed years later it occurred to me how few people in my life ever understood me well enough to have sensed such a subtle change percy was furious but i could hear a little sadness in what he d said at any other time i would have felt bad for even mentioning dan let alone for accusing percy of not caring about how i felt about dan death on that day i was too upset to care about percy feelings anymore and i laughed dryly yes you always have cared enough not to tell me the truth because you laura are the epitome of honestly itself percy said sarcastically i would have told you the truth if i knew you already knew it i yelled you always want honestly unless it involves you being honest percy said more loudly than before quit changing the subject i said knowing it wasntone of my best comebacks you re the one who changed the subject away from the potion in the first place fine you want to get back to the potion if you would have told me the truth then the potion wouldnthave blown up professor snape walked between the two of us pushing us aside clearly the potion hasntblown up yet but it will if you two stand there stupidly yelling at each other he snapped waving his wand and making the potion disappear he turned to glare at me you both know better than to leave a potion unattended especially a potion that is obviously incompetently made you could have killed half of the people in the room then you shouldnthave assigned an impossibly difficult potion i snapped without thinking still glaring at percy this got the class attention i was sure that the class had been listening to the exchange between percy and me hoping for a major blowout however when i turned my anger on snape everyone turned to see how he d respond i slowly faced professor snape afraid of what i would see at first snape didntsay anything he just looked at me for several seconds i thought that this should count as sufficient punishment but i knew that the real punishment was to come i had just enough time to wonder what horrors oliver had been referring to on our walk back from hogsmeade when he told me it was best not to think about what the professors could put you through during detention apparently miss debman believes that i should not ask you to do lessons that i believe will truly test you perhaps miss debman feels that i should only ask things of you that i know you are capable of i believe you have all proven that you can write papers maybe miss debman would object less to a foot long essay on another potion which requires teamwork the class groaned well miss debman is this a more suitable assignment than preparing the epiphany potion snape asked no sir i said trying to answer how i thought he wanted me to very well make it a foot and a half i winced i meant it doesntmatter what you meant he snapped turning quickly the rest of you have potions to monitor he said percy and i sat at the desk in complete silence while the rest of the class tried their best to make an epiphany potion no one potion looked quite how the book said it should look but no one else made their potion almost blow up either i decided that a person who wanted to have a bright idea would be well advised to spend their time thinking instead of attempting to make that potion when the class period finally ended percy and i gathered our things and went our separate ways he walked out of the room quickly and i walked over to oliver oliver smiled kindly rotten luck with the potion i shook my head more like rotten preparation it was an impossible assignment he said quietly so snape couldnthear i laughed a little mainly just to recognize his attempt at making me feel better about failing the project well what done is done yes oliver said i noticed that he had paused before agreeing but decided i d rather not know why oliver and i waited for joan tara adam and cedar rose had apparently already left the room and mark had opted out of taking potions at the n e w t level which at the time i considered a very good idea on his part the six of us walked out of the classroom trying to talk our ways out of the bad moods that the potion had put us in had we known what would greet us in the hallway we wouldnthave bothered oliver and i who were in the back of the group had just walked into the hallway the six of us stopped dead in our tracks rose who must have been talking to marcus flint while we were still in the potions lab was leaning up on her toes she kissed flint firmly but quickly that would have been enough for us completely to forget about our potions woes what happened next was even more shocking flint took her in his arms and kissed her back i dontthink my mouth had ever dropped open as far as it did then i wish i had thought of looking at the other seventh years for their reactions i am sure their faces probably looked similar to my own i will be damned adam said confidently rose and flint realized they had an audience and turned toward us neither one of them looked even slightly embarrassed i never knew rose could perform the imperius curse adam whispered to tara but all of us could hear him very funny still rose said i decided to take a page out of oliver book and act on my feelings that was a month ago oliver said i didntsay i decided it right away rose said you ve been acting on your feelings for months cedar said rose smiled and it paid off come on marcus let find someplace with more privacy rose and flint headed further into the dungeons and the rest of us started making our way to gryffindor tower i dontlike that relationship oliver said suddenly we d all been relatively quiet as we tried to shake off our surprise i looked up at him what happened to let not give up hope if rose hasn t that was when she didntstand a chance and it was funny if she likes him we should support it i said she our friend it marcus flint adam said making a face i normally would have found amusing who are we to tell our friend whom she can and cannot date i asked getting defensive i didntsay we should tell her she cantdate him oliver said what did you mean then laura because if you outwardly dontsupport the relationship then you might as well tell her she shouldntdate him what relationship oliver asked sounding more confused than anything they hardly know each other and we hardly know him it not a huge deal adam said trying his best to smooth things over oliver reached out and touched my arm this isntabout rose and flint is it i didntanswer or even acknowledge he d said anything no one going to say anything to rose laura joan said softly we donthave to like flint in order to be glad rose is happy i nodded oliver took my hand and gave it a gentle squeeze i squeezed his hand back and barely smiled up at him we reached the portrait of the fat lady and after adam gave the password walked in there was about an hour which students usually spent wasting time between when class ended and when dinner was served most assignments took longer than one hour to complete and the consensus was that if you didnthave enough time to finish an assignment then there was no point in beginning it at that time the fact that most of the fifth and seventh years could now be found studying during this hour before dinner was a testament to the rest of the school as to how near the end of the year was i going to go upstairs and get a book oliver said taking his hand back i think i going to take a nap i said nonchalantly oliver looked at me disbelievingly what i asked you ve been studying more than any of us especially more than we have during this time not to mention that you never take naps oliver said then i think i can afford missing one hour of studying considering how much more than the rest of you i ve been studying i said a bit snappishly oliver didntpush the issue i sure you can i ll see you at dinner i nodded before walking upstairs and falling onto my bed without even taking off my shoes i didntbother closing the curtains around my bed oliver was right i normally didnttake naps i always woke up with a headache and feeling more tired than before but on that day all i knew was that i was exhausted and in a bad mood and i hoped an hour of sleep would help cure both of these problems joan woke me up for dinner i groaned the nap unsurprisingly had made me feel physically worse i thought that this was probably a bad sign for my mood i rolled over and told joan that i had a headache and wasnthungry some food will probably help your headache joan said she started tugging on my arm making it obvious that naptime was over i dragged myself out of bed brushed my hair quickly and followed joan downstairs to meet the others i barely even heard the conversation on the way to dinner it wasntuntil we all sat down in the great hall that i realized that rose was with us and that this actually meant something that day you look like hell she said probably in response to me looking at her as if we d never met before i smiled at her frankness i just tired you on the other hand look like you re having a pretty good day i said teasingly i thought we were done with that rose said sounding irritated but smiling i cocked my head we talked about flint and me the whole way down here she said showing her own confusion and i missed it i asked you were there mark said but we can have the conversation again if you d like adam offered i d rather not rose said please cedar said sarcastically you like the attention rose simply smiled neither confirming nor denying this how could you miss that entire conversation mark asked well i didntrealize it was important the group laughed at me do i get a summary or not i asked grinning summaries of conversations were mark and adam specialty they d gotten practice while judging the spats between percy and me so that was quite a show you put on an hour ago adam said and it was obvious he d originally said this i dontknow what you re talking about mark said mimicking rose fairly well the rest of us laughed forgetting dinner even rose was obviously amused she did have a good sense of humor regarding herself right you ve completely forgotten hooking up with flint after potions adam said remarkably like cedar the two of us did not hook up we simply decided to swap some saliva mark said i did not say that rose said as the rest of us cracked up what are you expecting direct quotes mark asked innocently artistic license keep going cedar encouraged and are the two of you a couple now adam asked as either tara or joan i wasntsure which a couple i ll have the sucker proposing within a week mark was cut off by rose dinner roll hitting him in the face which made us all laugh even harder but ended the performance the teasing on the other hand kept going i was glad that i hadntmissed anything on the walk to the great hall no one had said anything substantial about marcus flint as joan had said we didnthave to like flint in order to be happy for rose i felt horrible for doubting that my friends really meant this my headache went away once i had eaten something proving joan correct yet again my mood improved a little as we finished giving rose a hard time and moved on to other subjects lately we had been avoiding discussing school because it inevitably led to conversations about n e w t s we mainly talked about things that we d done in the past many times the group relived events that had happened before i started hanging around with them sometimes i felt left out most of the time i had been there or had at least been aware of the events and was able to offer a different perspective for the event during that dinner i made sure that i was paying attention to and participating in the conversation in case something important was discussed after we all got enough to eat we started making our way out of the great hall we temporarily split into two groups based on what side of the table we d been sitting on my side of the table reached the doors before the other group we stopped by the marble staircase to wait for them as the rest caught up with us i noticed that percy was walking down the stairs quickly trying to reach the great hall in time to have enough time to eat a decent meal i watched him come down most of the way before turning my attention to my friends percy didntdo anything to suggest he d noticed me i was horrible at playing it cool but in my defense i didnthave very good models to imitate oliver was looking at me worriedly joan and tara were looking at me sadly and the rest were looking anywhere but at me i laughed a little it amazing in a castle of this size how impossible it is to avoid seeing someone the others laughed relieved that i wasntpretending as if nothing had happened even though nothing really had happened so mark said you re back on the silent treatment congratulations i shrugged it not so bad no but it not as entertaining as when the two of you are speaking either he said grinning i laughed sorry to disappoint you am i ahead of percy in your contest between the two of us for winning our disagreements with the point you got today in potions you re ahead by two points i won the fight in potions i asked doubtfully adam shook his head slightly we decided to give you the benefit of the doubt i couldntreally follow the argument i started walking up the staircase and the others followed right away i ll take the points however i can get them i said forcing myself to laugh by the time i reached to top of the stairs oliver had caught up with me he took my hand again i looked up at him and smiled it struck me that oliver had barely said a word since we d left for dinner something wrong i asked quietly with me oliver asked i nodded he gave me an odd look yes he said i worried about you me i asked why would you be worried about me you ve been acting strangely today taking a nap missing an entire conversation i was tired i laughed dismissively it no wonder with all of the extra work we ve had this week what about fighting with almost everyone you ve talked to today i haven t are you talking about i stopped talking because i realized the rest of the seventh years were listening i couldntreally blame them oliver and i werentlowering our voices and it not as if the seventh years could take a different route to get to gryffindor i pulled oliver to the side of the hallway and our friends paused uncertain whether they should keep going we ll come up in a minute i said making myself smile the group exchanged perplexed looks before continuing the walk to gryffindor tower i think the aliens got to her i heard adam saying i shook my head and turned back to oliver i donthave the heart to tell him that wizards told muggles about aliens a long time ago to try to open their minds to different types of people it didntgo over very well of course the wizards probably shouldnthave tried to prove the lie with those flying lights you re changing the subject oliver said seriously but smiling you still haventexplained why you ve gotten upset with almost everyone today are you talking about that whole thing about rose and flint on the way back from potions partially i shouldnthave gotten that upset i admitted i should have known all of you and especially you wouldnthave said anything to rose and i sorry i doubted you all it ok oliver said in a tone that suggested that he d never really been offended we all know why you would think that i mean you mean percy said something to me about you i said yes oliver admitted that was what i was really upset about i smiled so there nothing to worry about oliver shook his head that not what wrong what i asked my smile faltering i know that you being angry over that wouldnthave made you miss a conversation an hour later it never has before i didntanswer but i think you are pissed at percy i always pissed at percy yes oliver admitted sounding frustrated i wish you would just tell me what happened during potions what anyone listening knew that the fight wasntabout the potion the two of you were talking about honesty more than the potion ingredients oliver said sounding slightly guilty at admitting that he d been eavesdropping along with the rest of the classroom if you wanted to know what percy and i were talking about why didntyou just ask that in the first place i asked with irritation i wasntgoing to ask at all oliver said defensively but i also didntthink you were as upset about it as you clearly are i didntrespond i was starting to get angry again and was focusing on not directing my anger at oliver i just want to help he said taking my other hand in his other sometimes i miss the days when you didntgive a damn i muttered he smiled you dontmean that no i admitted more begrudgingly than i really felt it going to sound stupid if i explain it out loud i promise not to think that it stupid oliver said still smiling and if it bothering you it isntstupid and whatever is wrong is going to bother me until you tell me and you ll bother me until i tell you i said getting more to the point probably oliver admitted now why are you mad at percy i took a deep breath because he should have told me the truth i said quickly as if i d wanted to say that for a while and it had been pushing to get out about what oliver asked patiently dan it was obvious that oliver hadntbeen expecting this he let go of my hands and put his hands in his pockets many wizards did this automatically whenever something made them nervous or caught them off guard after all their wands were usually in their pockets what about dan oliver asked carefully evidently not completely certain that he wanted to know the answer that i had been dating him i said with some annoyance but you already knew that oliver said slowly trying to put everything together exactly i said his last statement releasing more of my resentment of course i already knew did percy think it would have been a surprise to me if he would have told me i doubt it oliver said answering my rhetorical question so if percy knew what i knew why in the hell in four years would he never once mention it why in four years was it not important enough to even suggest to me that he knew the truth and that i wasntprotecting him from anything that all of the times that i wanted him to understand to know that i loved his brother too that i was hurting too all of that time that i told myself that if he knew it would i dontknow i guess i thought that if percy knew i loved dan too that he wouldntbe able to feel like his grief had the priority for four years i never told him about dan and me so percy pain could always come first because dan was his brother and best friend and in all of that time percy never acknowledged my grief at all even i was surprised by the amount of anger i felt over this for a month i had barely thought about this side of the fight i was having with percy i had thought that i was only angry because percy was pissed at me for dating oliver all of our verbal disagreements until potions had been centered around that for the past month whenever i d thought about the fact that percy had known about dan and me i d quickly thought of something else potions had made it hard to keep ignoring my feelings hence my bad mood that afternoon oliver pressing me on these feelings made ignoring them impossible while i thought about my own anger oliver tried to sort out everything i d been telling him he seemed to know that it was his turn to say something but he still was confused over what i was talking about how did percy know you dated dan he asked eventually dan told him i said bluntly oh oliver said taken off guard again of course dan never told me he d told percy i muttered and percy told you all of this during potions oliver asked incredulously no of course not i said i dontthink he meant to tell me at all when did he tell you he knew the night i told him i was dating you i answered for four years silence and then when it looks as if i finally moving on i started muttering again are you saying that percy used dan to try to guilt you out of dating me oliver asked starting to sound angry himself i put my anger on hold long enough to think about what he d asked no i decided unwilling to portray percy as being that cold no matter how upset with him i was he wasnttrying to guilt me then why would percy bring him up oliver asked i dontknow i think he was afraid i d forgotten dan you haven t oliver said not jealously just stating a fact i couldn t but percy wouldntknow that he never cared to ask i said bitterly laura i dontlike percy oliver said frankly but i do know some things about him i know that percy wouldnthave kept a secret like that from you in order to hurt you i know that but it did hurt me i said knowing that this form of argument was childish anyway he wasnttrying not to hurt me he was trying to avoid hurting himself but isntthat why you never told him to avoid hurting him i mean oliver said carefully trying to make sure that i didntturn my anger against him yes i said maybe he thought you never told him in order to prevent hurting yourself too it different i said frustrated i wasnttelling him something that i thought he didntknow he wasnttelling me something he knew i already knew my feelings prevented me from acknowledging the weakness of the argument not to mention that i wasntreally addressing his comment i know oliver said sympathetically i just saying that maybe percy was afraid to bring it up because he thought there was a reason you never did there was a reason i said impatiently i didntthink about how complicated my own feelings were let alone my reasoning supporting these feelings i didnttell him because i didntwant to add my pain to his maybe he knew that oliver said gently so i could take on his pain but mine was mine alone i said selfishly oliver didntrespond what could he say without pissing me off oliver do you realize how hard that first year after dan died was i asked oliver shook his head and looked away from me for the first time since i d started telling him what was troubling me the weasleys were supposed to take me home the morning that dan died but that clearly was out of the question by the time i shook off the initial shock of everything that had happened mr and mrs weasley had other people to deal with and barely noticed i was still there there were people from the ministry and st mungo s i just wanted to leave i sent my owl to my parents with a letter telling them that they would have to come get me and i just had to wait for them to get my letter and drive to the burrow i didntknow what else to do so after i sent the letter i searched for percy and found him in his bedroom alone so i sat by him took his hand and let him cry i tried to get him to talk about dan but he wouldn t so we sat in silence until bill finally came to the room to tell me my parents were downstairs it was the same thing at the funeral and dinner afterwards i sat by percy and held his hand i know oliver said quietly taking his hands out of his pocket to wrap his hands around one of mine i was there at the funeral i didntsee percy again until school started a month later everything was normal unless anyone came up to tell him they were sorry about dan percy would nod until the person went away and then he would pretend as if nothing had happened sometimes i would find him alone in the common room late at night or in the corner of the library not crying but i dontknow something close to crying and i sat by him and held his hand until he went on pretending like everything was normal again i looked down at the ground and oliver squeezed my hand reassuringly i looked up into his face and decided to say what i was thinking no matter how it made me sound where was he when i needed him i dontknow oliver said i dontknow either oliver reached out and brushed a piece of my hair behind my ear touching my cheek on the way i wasntsure why he did it at first i thought maybe he was brushing away a tear but i wasntcrying i didnteven feel like crying i was talking to another person about dan but i didntwant to cry it still hurt to talk about it but it didnthurt as much as it had when i d talked about dan earlier in the year i took this as further evidence that if i would have had someone to talk to dan death wouldnthave hurt as much as it had for as long as it had after a minute of silence oliver said cautiously maybe percy did think he was protecting you by letting you think he didntknow right i said sarcastically oliver ignored my comment maybe percy thought that if you could focus on helping him it would help you with your own pain help my pain by ignoring it i asked critically help your pain by directing it to something else help it by making something else more important than it help it by allowing you to move past it i narrowed my eyes partially because of my suspicion of the ideas and partially because of my confusion and maybe partially to try to block ideas that sounded a bit too close to truth for comfort maybe percy thought he was protecting you by letting you believe that you were protecting him could that be true had it helped me to put my pain on the backburner while focusing on how percy was feeling i immediately dismissed the idea it had hurt me to act as if my pain had meant nothing i had hated ignoring my feelings yet hadntit been easier to think about not getting any sympathy than to think about why i needed the sympathy hadnti replaced feelings of my own loss with sympathy for percy s then all along when i thought i was the good friend because i was protecting percy it was really him protecting me i said slowly no oliver said quickly squeezing my hand gently you were protecting him i wasn t he already knew about dan and me laura what do you think you were doing every time you sat beside him and held his hand i looked away from him as the thought hit me i had never felt as if i was doing anything to help percy during those times i had felt as if no one could do anything for percy except perhaps dan i always felt the worst for percy when i thought about how dan would have been the most suited person to help percy through losing a brother you both protected each other as well as you knew how isntthat what best friends do oliver said softly i looked back up at oliver who was smiling encouragingly i glanced down at his hands enveloping my own hand as if they were shielding my hand from something no as if he was protecting me from something i took my hand back stepped closer to oliver and placed my arms loosely around his neck he quickly returned my hug wrapping his arms around me pulling me a little closer i rested my head on his chest thank you i said what for oliver asked protecting me i answered i laughed a little at myself feeling too sentimental and feeling a little weak for needing some protection oliver laughed once or twice too i glad i can i thought a bit more about what oliver had suggested about how i had dealt with my grief after dan died still hugging him for some support i dontknow if percy really was thinking those things you said he was i said finally i think what you said is what you think i did to deal with my grief oliver didntrespond which meant that i had guessed correctly he d told me what he thought i d been feeling by using percy as a cover in case his ideas didntgo over well dontworry i said smirking although he couldntsee that i not going to get mad at you for being right i wouldntblame you for being mad at me for saying those things true or not oliver said sounding relieved anyway i laughed a little well i not angry not at you anyway you re still angry at percy oliver asked yes but not as angry i not as angry with him for not telling me about dan at least the two of us should have talked about that years ago and i cantcast all of the blame on that can i i going to choose not to answer that question oliver said i laughed good choice i sighed at least i have someone to talk to now always laura i wondered why i hadnttold oliver sooner about percy knowing about dan i d told him about so many things that had troubled me for years oliver was the only one to whom i d admitted that part of me had felt responsible for dan death i d gone to oliver when i thought i had figured out what i needed in life to be happy even when the two of us were barely friends i d been able to tell him about my worst fear of being alone for the rest of my life hadntoliver helped me progress past all of those things he d helped me see that even though dan might not have been in the quidditch pitch the morning he died if i hadntasked him to join me it didntmean that it was my fault he d died dan had decided to meet me that morning dan had fallen off his broom i had done everything i could to try to help dan had died but it wasntmy fault and after i told oliver that i needed percy and him to be happy in order to be happy myself hadntoliver quickly assured me that neither of them would want me to be unhappy i had needed him to point out the obvious no fight could be responsible for all of our problems five years later even if oliver percy and i had gone through hogwarts as three friends we still would have been forced to face life if i blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my two friends lives i would never have any chance to be happy myself i was still working on getting over my worst fear i referred to the fear as the fear of being alone when i d told oliver about it he had tried to tell me that there was one person for everyone it was one of the only times oliver words made me feel worse not better after all i was afraid of there being one person for everyone i was afraid that my person had died the summer before my fourth year dating oliver had made my fear subside partially ultimately i decided that oliver had been wrong at least as far as i was concerned i decided that there was more than one person for me or i was there for more than one person one of those people had died it was no reason for me to be lonely and with time the conversation we had that night would fall under the category of talks with oliver that changed how i viewed my own life eventually i would be able to admit that taking care of percy and maybe even resenting percy a little had helped me deal with dan death it might not have been the best approach to dealing with my feelings but it had worked at least a little more importantly i saw that i had been there for my best friend when he needed me the most that was enough to stop being angry with percy over that situation and hadntoliver helped me realize that hadntoliver helped me see all of that i took a step away from oliver sliding my arms away from his neck but keeping my hands on his upper arms near his elbows i love you oliver i said it suddenly occurred to me that we had been having this conversation in a hallway that did get a heavy flow of traffic how many people had walked by since we had started the conversation how many people had heard bits and pieces i looked around quickly to see if anyone was in earshot at the moment then it struck me that i couldntdo anything about what people had or hadntheard shouldnti be more concerned that i d just told oliver that i loved him i d just told oliver that i loved him i scanned his face quickly there was a look of surprise there so yes i must have said it aloud i continued monitoring his face as the surprise was slowly erased by a small smile i took this to be a good sign and smiled back i love you i repeated paying attention so i could hear myself say it and i have for a long time i added he smiled at me a little more broadly i love you too he said you do i asked tears coming into my eyes i wondered why it was that i wanted to cry more now than i had at other points in the conversation he laughed yes i do he pulled me a little closer to himself and i have for a long time he said quietly i laughed too glad to have a reaction more suited to happiness than shedding tears i put my arms back around his neck and kissed him the kiss lasted for a minute until i heard people walking down the hallway and broke away from oliver a large group of second and third year gryffindors walked past us talking loudly amongst themselves i wondered if they even noticed that we were standing there oliver and i watched them disappear around a corner and then laughed i wasntsure why we should probably get out of this hallway i said taking one of oliver hands in my own he nodded and the two of us walked back towards gryffindor we didntsay anything until we were almost to the fat lady portrait the rest of the seventh years are probably wondering whether we ll come back as a couple or just as friends oliver said laughing a little why were you worried i asked grinning he laughed self consciously i wasntsure what you were upset about for all i knew you were ready to break up with me so yes i was a little worried we reached the portrait but neither of us gave the password i looked at the portrait for a few seconds and then looked at oliver you really think they re worried about us oliver shrugged a little i paused thinking about the studying that i was going to be facing as soon as i walked into the common room think they ll survive i asked oliver laughed i think they ll make it would you like to take a walk i asked grinning that sounds like a good idea he said taking my hand as the two of us walked away from the common room i decided to ignore what the fat lady was muttering to herself about people bothering her for no reason maybe it was just my good mood but i didntthink she sounded as angry as she usually did when someone bothered her for no reason author note when i told you all that the last chapter was difficult to write i forgot to knock on wood this chapter showed me some of what difficult to write really means the conversations in this chapter gave me fits especially difficult was the final conversation between laura and oliver suffice it to say that i have five different drafts of the conversation considering how much had to be revealed in just a few pages i satisfied enough with how it turned out the internal conflicts that laura had over dan are about as resolved as they are going to get she forgave herself for the circumstances of his death this chapter starts the process of her accepting that dan death hurt her i do think that these are two different conflicts dealing with the death and dealing with her feelings over it and i do think the latter would be harder for her to come to accept but the story is not finished there are still conflicts to attend to and things for the characters to learn about themselves and each other i have to admit that fred and george second law of school sucks was inspired by the laws of applied terror they can be found at http that link doesntwork google first law of applied terror thank you to all of the people who have reviewed this story i ve read them all probably more than once and they helped motivate me to write this chapter thanks again to electronicquillster marie dantes for the extra advice and entertaining e mails coming up in the next chapter relationships around oliver and laura influence their own relationship r e v i e w what does that spell review yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh spirit fingers that morph into jazz hands author note there are no major half blood prince spoilers in this chapter after all this is three years before half blood prince however in later chapters there will be half blood prince spoilers you have been warned chapter 12 puddlemere divided the professors were covering more material during class and at a faster rate than we seventh years had ever experienced despite this we suddenly saw a drastic cut in homework assignments we received in almost every subject all new material was covered during class so our time outside of class could be dedicated to reviewing old material while we were all glad to have the time to study for n e w t s we all quickly ran into a problem with the new homework situation it was discouraging when we were working on a normal assignment we could see our progress for example if we had one hundred pages for defense against the dark arts to read we could easily see our progress by checking the page number studying isntlike that we could study one subject for twenty hours and feel just as uncertain about whether we had studied enough this discouragement combined with an overload of information and the tediousness of the study material made focusing on studying very difficult oliver and i quickly found a way to focus on the material we needed to study we took turns quizzing each other we had to pay attention in order to hear each question or to think of a question to ask in order to stay on task we turned the quiz sessions into small competitions keeping track of how many questions each of us answered correctly both of us were competitive enough that we took even these trivial contests seriously during close games studying was actually fun on this particular thursday night it was not a close competition oliver and i were going over transfiguration notes from our fifth year oliver hadntcared much about the material two years previously that night he cared about ten times less which spell would you use to turn water into glass i asked looking down into the old transfiguration book um oliver said he sighed dramatically the i dontgive a flying broomstick spell close the crystallizing spell i said looking up from the book oliver smiled how was my answer close because i dontgive a flying broomstick about the crystallizing spell either i said closing the textbook and dropping it on the floor i leaned further back into the small sofa oliver and i were sitting on which was facing one of the many corners of the common room we have to keep studying like this for almost two more weeks i said closing my eyes and bringing my hands up to my temples to try to get rid of the small headache my unpleasant thought gave me yes and then there the week of taking the tests by day and studying at night oliver said my headache got a bit worse thanks for that little piece of optimism i said laughing and taking my hands away from my head sorry i never liked transfiguration oliver said leaning into the sofa as well and looking at the wall then why did you take it after o w l s i asked it required in order to work at the ministry as are potions and defense or i probably wouldntbe taking those either i like defense i said i do too this year but we ve never had a decent teacher before lockhart was rather amusing i said oliver laughed all of the girls seemed to think so i grinned all right then what classes would you have taken by choice then the easiest ones i could oliver said honestly muggles studies which i am taking divination care of magical creatures those arentrequired to work at the ministry i asked muggles studies is and charms i actually like those classes i watched oliver carefully for a few seconds it your worst nightmare isntit i asked quietly what is working for the ministry oliver raised his eyebrows in surprise no of course not my dad works there half of my relatives do so so oliver sighed it not my worst nightmare i smiled sympathetically well you wontbe working at the ministry so it doesntmatter oliver smiled back i hope you re right i will be i bent down picked the transfiguration textbook up off the floor and turned so i was leaning up against the arm of the sofa unfortunately even if being a keeper doesntrequire a good n e w t in transfiguration working for the prophet does so we d best get back to it i handed him the book oliver opened the book compliantly and starting flipping through the pages to find where we d left off as he was searching there was a sudden decline in the noise level of the room one moment there was the sound of quiet conversations and quills scratching on parchment and the next moment almost complete silence oliver noticed the silence too and the two of us shifted so that we could look over the back of the sofa to see the rest of the common room it wasnthard to spot what had grabbed everyone attention tara was standing by the fireplace with her hand in adam s he was down on one knee a jewelry box in his other hand i was too far away to hear adam words he didntspeak long as soon as he stopped tara started nodding quickly adam slipped the ring on her finger and the gryffindors in the common room clapped and whistled loudly while laughing oliver and i were no exceptions it would have been impossible not to show our happiness for our two friends did you know he was going to propose i asked after tara and adam left the common room to escape from everyone attention yes but not when or where he d do it we sat back down on the couch in the way it meant to be sat upon i reached out and put my hand in oliver s that was so cute i said unable not to get girly over the scene oliver laughed i think he should have done it in the great hall that would have been kind of embarrassing for tara i said knowing adam wouldnthave been embarrassed by the stunt exactly oliver said laughing even more i laughed too though i felt a little guilty for thinking it would have been entertaining to see adam propose to shy tara in front of the majority of the school mark tried to talk him out of it when he told us about proposing and showed us the ring oliver said was mark serious it hard to tell sometimes he gave both serious and comical reasons why adam shouldntget engaged this early if he gave any serious reasons then he was serious i said he was probably just a little afraid of losing his best friend i guess it possible oliver said but you dontthink so i think if it is possible for one friend not to be threatened by his best friend getting married then mark and adam would probably be the two most likely to fit that bill what was mark worried about then that adam wasntmarrying the right girl oliver laughed and i knew why though he told me anyway adam and tara have only dated each other they ve known half of their lives that the other was the right one even before they knew what that really meant everyone and especially mark would say that eventually adam and tara should get married eventually i agreed seventeen does seem very young to get engaged mark mentioned that oliver said i smiled thinking i d correctly guessed mark misgiving but mark knows better than that most of the people in his family are wizards what does that have to do with anything i asked getting a little defensive as i did fairly often when people starting talking about blood so mark knows that wizards consider it perfectly normal to get married young oliver said good naturedly muggles i believe tend to believe that young people who get married are forced into it by circumstances i laughed circumstances pregnancies and whatnot he said well that not entirely true it not entirely untrue but sometimes muggles get married young because they want to oliver yes but it still unexpected it not unexpected for young wizards to marry it perfectly acceptable no questions about circumstances asked i laughed again all right then why is mark so worried about adam and tara if it perfectly acceptable for the two to marry young oliver shrugged a little he brought up several things the two donthave much money to start a life together with tara family has plenty of money i interrupted yes but i sure adam and tara wontwant to rely on that adam and tara both want to work they have careers that they need to focus on i sure they ll work for a while before marrying i said smiling i not worried about them they ll make it work even while working and with little money yes oliver agreed confidently but perhaps a little unenthusiastically think they re afraid i asked after several seconds undoubtedly even adam adam a little na ve but even he knows that it a big decision laura i know that i said i just mean adam makes a decision and doesntworry about it much i think marriage is enough to strike fear in any man i laughed why is that the same reasons it scares women once they look past all of the romantic notions surrounding the idea i think oliver said it one of those decisions that shapes your entire life even if the marriage doesntlast a lifetime doesntthat kind of choice always make people wonder if they are making the right decision or what would happen if they were to choose differently i guess i thought for a minute i think even if the decision to get married is terrifying maybe it takes a little fear out of life too i mean you wouldnthave to be afraid of being alone you wouldnthave to worry as much about what you look like oliver interrupted me with a laugh guess you arentplanning on being a trophy wife i laughed too oliver we both know that i not qualified to be a trophy wife oliver didntrespond and i felt bad for putting him in a position where he couldntsafely say anything without pissing me off i think having a trophy husband sounds much more appealing than being a trophy wife i said grinning to show that i wasntserious oliver smiled and shook his head you d find him boring yes i admitted making sure i sounded disappointed just as well i guess i could never afford a trophy husband on what the prophet pays of course that only if the prophet agrees to pay me at all so i bent down picked up the transfiguration book off the floor and handed it to oliver oliver sighed but started flipping through pages in the transfiguration book again we had already lost too much studying time that evening as it was for the record i slaughtered oliver in our studying competition that night correctly answering more than three times as many questions as he did the next morning at breakfast was the first time all of the seventh year gryffindors minus percy were together after the engagement adam and tara were floating on air receiving congratulations and best wishes from students from different houses the rest of us gryffindors had already congratulated them ten times over and had quickly reached the point where we couldntcongratulate them anymore without appearing as if we didntmean it by about halfway through breakfast most of adam and tara friends from other houses had already come up to talk to the couple and our normal group was left alone when oliver and i began dating the group dynamic stayed about the same as far as the group was concerned there wasntmuch of a difference between oliver and i dating and the two of us being best friends there was a difference between adam and tara dating and adam and tara being engaged to be married and everyone in the group felt it we all knew there was going to be a bit of awkwardness until someone brought the subject up so of course adam did and being adam he got straight to the point we re really growing up arentwe we all agreed in our own ways i nodded oliver half smiled rose laughed a bit tara looked sad and the rest verbally agreed with the statement it hard to believe that in a little over three weeks we ll all graduate especially considering how long we ve spent here joan said i hardly remember life before hogwarts it seems almost like someone else lived that life before i came here tara agreed merlin in another four weeks i going to be working at gringotts cedar said grimacing at the though i wasntsure what pained her more the idea of working at gringotts or the idea of working cedar wasntsure yet what she really wanted to do so her father who worked for the ministry of magic in goblin liaisons had gotten her a temporary job at the bank yeah and i ll be interviewing for the ministry rose said me too said mark i was a little surprised that the idea of working for the ministry didntbother mark as it did oliver overall mark seemed too sarcastic to take orders from people and too fun to be in such a boring area of work however the idea of working his way up through the chain of command appealed to him i ll be training to be a healer joan said she d been accepted to the university of healing and magical medicines months ago with her excellent grades and prefect title i hoped she d enter the wizarding equivalent of psychology but she was set on becoming a midwife she would work through st mungo s but most children were delivered in homes i shall be acting adam said dramatically you hope mark said good naturedly adam laughed i ll do muggle theater if i have to he paused even shakespeare i ll be at the daily prophet i hope i said and i hope i ll be playing quidditch and i ll be learning the family business so i can take over for my aunt when she retires tara said she said it as if it were nothing but tara would likely be the most successful of all of us her aunt and mother were daughters of alexander blotts cofounder of flourish and blotts we ll be all over the place wontwe joan asked sadly we wontget to see each other often well we ll all get together at the wedding adam said of course that will be at least a year from now there new year before that oliver said smiling reassuringly across the table at joan and we can always keep in touch through owl post tara added still wontbe the same will it cedar said not living in the same place all doing our own things with other people there are always weekends mark said hopefully that when quidditch matches are oliver said and shows adam added stores dontclose on weekends tara said softly and the prophet biggest paper comes out on sunday i said so much for that mark said before anyone else could rule out weekend get togethers we sat in silence eating eggs and toast the reality of graduation hitting us yes there would be perhaps a few times a year when it was possible for the whole group to be together but our relationships would all have to be on a more one on one level if they were going to continue i wondered what this would mean for my friendships with people in the group i wasntas close to such as rose and mark we got along well while with everyone but what were the odds we would go out of our way to see each other joan seemed to be having similar thoughts we all have to promise that we will keep in touch through owl post at the very least joan said suddenly all of us with everyone all of us quickly promised that we would do this time would be the only thing that would tell whether we meant our promise or if we were just trying to reassure joan i still cantbelieve you two are officially getting married in a year mark said turning to adam who was sitting next to him adam smiled and took tara hand we dontknow when exactly but we re planning for it being about a year after we get our careers moving along good idea oliver said tara nodded it mainly for adam of course so he can make a name for himself adam laughed it would be easier to make a name for myself with the blotts name connected to my own tara laughed too and turned to the rest of us that what he trying to avoid of course but he wontsay that in front of me what do you mean rose asked he means that he wants to make a name for himself on his own without any help that being tied to my family might possibly offer although i think he overestimating how much that connection would help him all of us decided that there was no purpose in pointing out that the blotts family donated a great deal of money to the arts since all of us knew this anyway i didntblame adam for wanting to succeed on his own merits merits all of us knew he had based on his ability to perfectly mock us not cruelly whenever he wanted well i cantwait for the ceremony joan said beaming i absolutely love weddings i hope there will be even more soon she said casting a meaningful glance at oliver and me i blushed and looked away from her quickly i felt oliver shift in his seat a little but he laughed well it should be only a matter of time before dave and cedar decide to get married oliver said turning the focus away from the two of us which i was grateful for cedar laughed the two of us canteven decide on careers do you think we re going to make a decision like marriage right out of hogwarts so i guess joan will just have to set her hopes on laura and oliver i blushed even more furiously and looked down at my plate oliver shifted in his seat again we ve only been dating for a couple of months i said well no one said you had to get married any time soon rose said i still need to do a bit of transfiguration i think i said standing up we haventhad homework in a week adam said yes but n e w t s are coming up very quickly i said i could use the extra half hour of studying i think i ll come too oliver said standing as well the two of us fled the great hall and started to make our way up to the library we re too young to get married even if wizards dontthink so i said quickly oliver laughed a little they were just giving us a hard time i looked over at him and grinned you were just as fast to run away from it as i was yeah oliver agreed the whole conversation was uncomfortable i dontlike to think about us all leaving here i donteither then let not think about it and go for a walk before defense oliver said smiling i agreed pretty sure that i wasntgoing to have many opportunities in the next two weeks to do anything but study eat and sleep i was proven correct and even though i d been expecting two horrible weeks i was unprepared for the hell we seventh years went through the professors seemed to decide that there was no longer any point in covering new material so lessons turned into massive review sessions these lessons were either boring or terrifying boring if we were reviewing information i d already gone over on my own and terrifying if we were reviewing spells i barely remembered existed if lessons were bad enough time outside of class was worse seventh years studied at almost all times during the day it became harder to navigate the halls because seventh years were sitting there in between lessons trying to cram even more information into their brains our year was so bad about this that filch actually added no studying to his list of things forbidden in the corridors professor dumbledore made him remove the rule due to the distress it was causing seventh years about the only times that most seventh years stopped studying were while sleeping and eating by the final weekend before exams started we started bringing books to the great hall so we could read during meals and for the first time since i d befriended oliver i started feeling very lonely again oliver and i had stopped quizzing each other because we both needed to focus on different parts of each subject even though we were usually sitting right next to each other while studying we might as well have been in different buildings when we spoke it was about n e w t s and their importance when we didntspeak it was because of n e w t s and their importance it should have worried me that neither one of us saw anything wrong with this we were both focused on doing well so we could be more certain of our futures finally the dreaded tests arrived i remember very little about the tests themselves written tests were in the morning practicals were in the afternoons and we stayed up cramming for the next tests late into the nights after each day my mood improved more and more i was confident i was doing well and could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel immediately after tests started our group of friends started acting more normally mark and adam started goofing around during book free meals again joan stopped taking points away from younger students for talking in the common room cedar and rose started spending a little time out of gryffindor tower to see dave and flint and oliver and i spent an hour or so in the evenings relaxing together he seemed more withdrawn than normal but i wrote it off as being caused by stress from the end of the school year on wednesday evening i found him by the fire in the common room reading a letter which he put away quickly when he noticed me letter from your other girlfriend i asked grinning no oliver said smiling just from mum he added then what are you trying to hide it for he laughed would you want anyone reading a letter from your mum it was a good enough argument that whether he was telling the truth or not i thought it best to drop the subject we took a short walk and oliver seemed happy enough though perhaps a bit preoccupied i might have paid more attention to oliver behavior but i was distracted by percy s percy hadnttalked to me since our fight in potions granted he d had few opportunities to break his silence he was usually in the library studying and we were too busy to bicker during class i d thoroughly expected his silent treatment to continue for the rest of the school year so i was shocked when he nodded and said hello pleasantly enough as oliver and i passed him while entering the common room to start studying again hello oliver said not paying much attention i stopped and turned to watch percy turn into the hallway leading to the rest of the castle he said hello to us nicely oliver who d gone into the common room turned and paused before answering percy yeah i guess he did i faced oliver again but why oliver shrugged maybe he not angry anymore i nodded stupidly and joined oliver in the common room which the fat lady sarcastically thanked me for the next day i walked into the great hall for breakfast alone as percy was walking out morning he said still walking percy i said turning to watch him go he stopped walking turned around and waited how are your exams going i asked grasping for something to say well yours same good he said yes i agreed i struggled to think of something to say to extend the conversation i ll be glad when they re over yes how your family i asked alive i smiled since our first year i d always asked him that question when he d gotten letters from home he d always given the same answer even after dan died when the answer alive meant something to both of us good i said yes well i ll see you around laura i nodded thrilled that percy was speaking to me at all yet a bit sad that even this simple conversation felt so forced percy walked out of the great hall and i joined the rest of my friends at the table that was weird adam said to me jerking his head toward where i d been talking to percy yeah i agreed i not sure what gotten into him an alien adam said we all laughed and then started our new morning routine of speculating on the next n e w t nothing changed during the rest of the week except the number of tests left to take at last after our potions practical exam hell week ended to much cheering laughing and drinking the butterbeer and firewhiskey were compliments of fred and george weasley who were fifth years and had just finished their o w l s in the common room here to the end of exams adam said for the sixth or seventh time raising his firewhiskey into the air to the end of exams the rest of us yelled raising glasses as well the sixth years joining us seemed just as happy as the fifth and seventh years but it probably had to do with the drinks and the nearness of summer vacation here to graduating and never taking another bloody test again adam said to graduation the seventh years cheered to no more homework mark said to no more prefect duties joan called out to no more snape that son of a bludger cedar said thrusting her glass into the air with so much force some butterbeer slopped out over the edge of her cup to no more snape the seventh years and some others echoed i laughed and looked over to oliver who was standing beside me he was raising his glass and smiling but he looked far away you ok i asked he snapped back to reality fine he said sure you ve seemed strange all week i fine he repeated to adam and the theater mark said wrapping his arm around his friend shoulder making me wonder exactly how much alcohol was in butterbeer and firewhiskey adam took mark into a quick hug patting him on the back to mark and the ministry adam said after releasing mark so they could both raise glasses and to rose and percy too percy nodded from across the room to accept the gesture he d joined in the celebration at first but had left when the drinks started taking effect perhaps not completely breaking up the party was celebration enough for percy and to oliver for making puddlemere adam said to oliver i joined in with the others and tara and flourish and blotts adam continued puddlemere i asked understanding what had been said you made puddlemere united i said turning to oliver he looked guilty not officially what do you mean i still have to try out but the coach wrote me and said i had a great chance of making the reserve team he said quickly oliver that great i said throwing my arms around him oliver returned the hug but slowly and with only one arm i noticed and considered it strange but it didntphase me much puddlemere and you wonthave to work for the ministry why didntyou tell me you d made it when did you find out i said tuesday he said simply tuesday i asked stepping back why didntyou say anything oliver looked a little to my right instead of right at me i just wanted some time to think about it did you get any other offers no then what there to think about i asked grinning oliver didntanswer my smile disappeared slowly finally i gathered enough nerve to repeat my question would you like to go for a walk oliver looking into my eyes asked instead of telling me what he had to think about no i said starting to feel a sinking sensation in my stomach oliver didntsay anything for several seconds enough time for adam and mark to toast a few random younger people whom percy would not allow to join in the party in the common room to the funny looking kid with glasses in the corner adam said adam that harry potter tara whispered to harry potter and his funny glasses adam said even louder to harry potter yelled the group all right let go i said wanting to get away from the noise i led oliver out of the common room into the small hallway near gryffindor and to the window that looked out over the lake we could still hear noise coming from the common room but now i could think oliver what wrong i asked turning my back on the view the window offered so i could watch oliver laura he looked down at his shoes just tell me i said impatiently i have to focus on quidditch i tried to make sense of this but failed yes i know oliver must have taken some encouragement from my comment he looked up again though he looked out the window then you know why i have to stop seeing you he asked part of me had been expecting this but it was still a blow it took me a minute which i spent closing my eyes to recover what do you mean i asked opening my eyes again oliver had turned his gaze back to me he sighed i have to put everything into this laura i get to play for puddlemere a professional team it been generations since anyone in my family has had this chance right out of hogwarts it what i ve always wanted so i asked bluntly so i have to give quidditch two hundred percent of me he said and i could tell he had prepared that line before we d started the conversation just like you ll have to give two hundred percent of yourself to the daily prophet and if i giving all of my attention to quidditch and you re giving all of your efforts to the paper then then we ll understand that there will be less time for each other for a while i interrupted unwilling to hear the rest of his script and what the point of that he asked the point of what i asked angrily in continuing this when we should be focusing on our careers i was floored again we can still focus on our careers and i can t he interrupted you cantplay quidditch and have relationships that mean anything i asked impatiently i suppose the people in your life have to wait until quidditch season is over no what then you want to see other people and are using quidditch i dontwant to see other people then what is your problem the problem is that when i got the letter telling me i have an excellent chance of getting what i ve worked for for years i thought of you every time i thought about puddlemere i thought about what it would mean for us so i asked seeing absolutely no problems in what he d said i cantfocus on quidditch while i constantly trying to balance it with you he said looking away again i not asking you to balance it with me i have never tried to get in the way you ve always tried to tell me there more to me than quidditch because there is and now i dontwant there to be i want to succeed laura i dontjust want to be a reserve player i want to be the keeper maybe someday the captain or coach i want you to succeed i want to succeed too but there will always be more than work oliv quidditch is my life quidditch is a sport i spat a game it crazy to just because you dontunderstand doesntmake it crazy he said looking at me without turning his head you re right i said forcing calm into my voice it unfair to say that everyone who is obsessed with quidditch is crazy what i meant was that you re crazy i am not will you listen to yourself you want nothing in your life but quidditch so you re throwing away the one thing in your life you feel might actually compete with it i said not even trying to hide my resentment i trying to make sure that nothing interferes with my focus on my career oliver said impatiently then what was the point in the last two months oliver what was the point in starting something if you were just going to end it once quidditch season started again i didntplan this he said i see now i dontfit in with your plan when quidditch was just a dream you needed someone else to believe in did i fit in with your plan i asked coldly i d meant it to be a harsh blow and it worked before this point he really had looked sorry now a wall went up i told you months ago during wizards and warlocks that i wouldntlet anything get in the way of what i wanted you knew all along what quidditch means to me so it my fault i said i the crazy one for actually believing that i meant something to you too his wall broke down a little you do mean something to me laura he said sincerely but not enough i said too much he said quietly i cantcompletely focus on quidditch because you mean too much to me his argument didntmake sense and everything in me knew that he was making a mistake yet what could i do what logical argument could i make against thoughts that were so illogical or maybe my feelings were making me illogical i stood there shaking my head slowly starting to feel as if i were going to cry he d seen me cry before but not because of anything he d done and i was unwilling to let that change i didntwant him to see i cared as much as he claimed he cared too much too much just not enough i said i stepped away from the window walked around oliver and headed back for the common room i didntwant to go back there but curfew had passed and i didnttrust myself to wander around the castle and pay enough attention to get back to gryffindor laura i sorry oliver called before i left the short hallway that just not enough i thought i didntthink i could say it aloud without my voice breaking so instead i turned the corner without looking back author note i sorry i really am this has been part of the story for as long as i can remember which was before i ever thought anyone but me would read the story part of me wanted to take this out because i knew readers wouldntlike it but that would be untrue to the story and to oliver character again this chapter wasntwritten to torture readers the story up to this point has been leading to this chapter and this chapter is necessary for the rest of the plot preview for the next chapter in the days before graduation one conversation solves some of laura problems another conversation with someone she never expected to identify with makes laura realize what caused most of the conflicts in her life and answers a question posed near the beginning of the story dontyou love cryptic chapter previews chapter 13 begin with a farewell i climbed into the common room while looking at the ceiling with my eyes wide open to prevent tears from falling down my face all i had to do was get through the common room and into the staircase leading up to my dormitory without crying after a few awkward steps into the common room i realized my odds of making it to my dormitory at all would be considerably better if i watched where i was going the party was still going strong in the middle of the room some people were dancing though there was no music that i was aware of adam noticed me and raised his glass into the air to laura debman and the daily prophet he shouted the others in the group echoed him raised their drinks and looked over in my direction i couldntforce myself to smile but i could nod in their direction the group didntseem to notice anything was wrong and they went back to their celebrating i hurried through the common room thinking about how lucky i was that most of the people in the room were too drunk or too happy to notice that oliver and i had left together and that i had entered alone near tears i opened the door to the dormitories and closed it as quickly as i could without slamming the door and drawing attention to myself i let out a sob before i could even face the stairway again the noise surprised me i had usually done my crying quietly in the middle of the night so none of the girls would know i was upset i d gotten so good at crying silently that i usually didntmake much noise even when i wasnttrying to hide my emotions i tried to remember the last time i d cried enough to make a sound it was when oliver had shown me the room in the quidditch stadium full of golden snitches and i had told him about the morning dan died the memory was hardly comforting and i started crying even more i practically ran up the stairs trying to reach the safety of my room without running into anyone unfortunately i paid for the luck i d just had in the common room laura is that you rose asked yes i answered trying to move past her what wrong she asked letting me pass but following me up the stairs i didntanswer finally i reached the dormitory i didnttry to prevent rose from following me instead i walked over to my bed jumped onto it and drew the curtain around me rose had drawn back the curtain before i d even fallen face down into my pillow laura what happened i pressed my face harder into the pillow trying to stop the crying which was only making things worse do you want me to go get joan rose asked awkwardly no i said quickly which forced me to lift my head off the pillow dontget joan just leave me alone i started to lower my head into the pillow again but rose caught my shoulder and pulled back on it making it almost impossible to hide my face i sat up gracelessly letting my legs hang over the side of the bed i put my elbows on my thighs and covered my eyes with my palms pressing into my eyes to see if that would stop my crying instead my eyes watered even more and spots of purple and green lights filled my vision if you dontwant me to get joan then tell me what wrong rose said simply quickly i weighed what would be worse telling rose who was never one to outwardly show much compassion or telling joan who would show nothing but compassion i realized it would probably be easier to deal with rose lack of emotions than to add joan emotions to my own we broke up i said quickly i let out a short laugh which probably sounded like a severe sob to rose i cantbelieve i one of those girls who weeps uncontrollably when her boyfriend breaks up with her i brought my hands away from my face to give rose a feeble smile i hate those kinds of girls rose smiled back obviously relieved i had attempted even a pathetic joke i hate those girls too yes well you re unlikely to end up being one i said sitting up straight i was still crying but there was little point in trying to prevent rose from seeing it anymore just because none of you like flint doesntmean that i cantlove him like you love oliver rose snapped i looked up at her again so surprised that i stopped crying for several seconds i meant that you scare the hell out of him and i doubt he could dump you what makes you think he would want to she asked defensively i i don t i stammered i was only kidding rose visibly relaxed i sorry laura you re upset and here i am attacking you i completely agreed with that statement but i thought it wouldnthelp anything to say so plus rose had just said something that had taken my attention away from oliver momentarily you love flint i asked before i could stop myself rose didntsay anything right away she looked at me carefully as if deciding whether she should take my question personally donttell the others i said that she said finally they might drop their supportive act not that i ve been buying it i wonttell them i said i let out another short laugh which i sure rose thought was a sob she made a face and took a tiny step back i probably wonteven have a chance to tell them now i said miserably why not he broke up with me rose i said so that doesntmean the rest of us stop being your friends i didntrespond but that was answer enough for rose she laughed did you think we only tolerate your company for oliver sake no i said honestly i just thought you d all take his side there are sides i thought about this no i guess not not anymore then you ll have a chance to tell the others i love marcus granted if you do i might curse you in your sleep she said pleasantly enough i wonttell them i promised again good well i going to go back downstairs i only came up here to get my cloak before going to see marcus it rather cold down in the dungeons sure you wouldntlike me to get joan i positive i said quickly i dontblame you i only threatened you with that so i could make sure no one was dead or dying i forced a small smile everyone fine i ll leave you then rose said walking over to the door she opened it and walked into the hallway i sorry he broke up with you laura i nodded thanks she shut the door quietly and i laid down on my back letting tears run down the sides of my face whenever they pleased no more sobbing no more noise back to my silent way of expressing grief i fell asleep wishing i could be celebrating the end of n e w t s with my friends and wondering whether oliver was upset or if he was in the common room having a good time i woke up when the girls came in for the night i knew it must be quite late but i didntcheck the time i had fallen asleep with the curtains around my bed open so i had to lay still with my eyes closed to convince the others i was sleeping i had no desire to talk to them and assure them i was fine poor thing joan whispered as the girls got changed into their pajamas he didntlook much better tara whispered no but it was his fault cedar said quietly speaking aloud what i was thinking think they ll make up tara asked maybe they have before joan said he an idiot rose said cedar laughed as quietly as she could he is rose continued breaking up with her so he can focus on quidditch he said we should have talked some sense into him i sure she already tried tara said anyway when has oliver ever listened to sense where laura was concerned joan asked fair point cedar said know what i think joan asked she didntwait for a response i think he liked her when we were kids whether he knew it or not and that why he took it so personally when she sided with percy i think he would have taken that personally anyway cedar said i really wanted to go to their wedding joan said sadly we know cedar said and i dontthink oliver appreciated you telling him that it took a lot of self control not to laugh i had made sure my breathing was deep and slow while they were talking fortunately the girls were all climbing into bed and didntnotice that i was holding my breath to avoid betraying my eavesdropping the girls said good night to each other i tried to go back to sleep but my thoughts kept me awake of course i wondered whether joan suspicions about why oliver had taken it so badly when i d taken percy side were true i decided that cedar was right he d have taken that badly whether he d thought of me as a friend or as more than a friend or less even i decided that i had no chance of falling asleep again anytime soon i listened carefully for a few minutes and as far as i could tell all of the girls were sleeping soundly i got out of bed quietly and left the room to go down and sit in front of the fire as i often did in the morning it was very late or very early so i expected the room to be empty i was quite surprised to find one person that hadntgone upstairs yet i started to go back upstairs but percy spoke first i thought you d come downstairs a hell of a lot earlier than three o clock he said he was sitting in front of the fire on the sofa that i considered my spot i wasntplanning on coming down at all i couldntsleep me either so i decided to come wait for you come sit down i did sitting on the right hand cushion because it was the nearest one percy was sitting in the middle of the sofa he watched me while i moved a bit to get comfortable why d you wait i asked to break the silence to make sure you re ok i ok laura we ve both spent quite a few nights in the common room at three a m but it was never because we were ok i looked at percy carefully he hadntlooked away since i sat down he appeared to be tired and sad and it reminded me of how he d looked during our fourth year when i would find him in the common room thinking about his brother except he d never looked at me then and he d never admitted anything was wrong i should have told you about dan and me i said percy winced slightly at the name but showed no further sign of pain i already knew i didntknow you knew i should have told you that i knew he said i nodded i was really angry with you for that percy smiled a bit but without humor i gathered as much during that potions class i didntknow that why i was so angry until that class but it was just as much my fault as yours that i didntknow you knew i dated dan then you arentangry now no percy paused you should be you were always there for me and i should have been there for you too i just wasntsure i could be i know i said choking back tears i wasntsure you could be either so i never told you oliver thinks it helped me to be there for you and he probably right that still no excuse and i am sorry percy said i nodded starting to cry for what seemed like the one hundredth time that day it ok percy we sat in silence for a few minutes watching what remained of the fire i heard the two of you broke up percy said you can say i told you so i said wiping away tears and percy had told me so warning me that oliver would only break my heart i only said that because i didntthink it was true percy said you re only saying that now to be nice not true percy said shaking his head i would never say anything nice about oliver i laughed not in much of a mood to defend oliver percy smiled as he usually did when he made me laugh i was one of the only people who seemed to understand his sense of humor no i never really thought he d break your heart laura and that why i was so angry i dontunderstand percy sighed not fond of discussing his own feelings we were all friends then after that whole ordeal our second year you chose my side that always made it seem as if i d won sure oliver got quidditch more friends and eventually captain of the quidditch team but you chose my side so i was the winner so when you told me you loved him i guess it was as if you were changing sides and he d beaten me all along i still wanted to be your friend that why i told you the truth about oliver and me right away but when i made you choose you chose him that had nothing to do with the fight our second year you hadntbeen treating me well i know percy said one more thing i owe you an apology for you already apologized for putting penelope ahead of me and i put oliver ahead of you so we re even ok on that one we re even he paused penelope and i broke up you know i looked away from the fire and at percy again no i didntknow when tuesday i didnthear yes well the gossip isntas good about the head boy as it is about the gryffindor quidditch captain what happened i asked ignoring his sarcasm i thought the two of you were in love yes well i thought the two of you were in love percy countered me too i said bitterly unfortunately oliver is an idiot he has this stupid idea that he wontbe able to give enough to quidditch if he with me he said a bunch of garbage about how he d focus on me too much as if i d ever tried to do anything except support his quidditch dreams he broke up with you to focus on his career percy asked strangely i told you he was an idiot he not much of an idiot percy said what i asked i mean it a good idea for us all to focus on our careers you ll be able to give more to the prophet too percy continued quickly are you standing up for oliver i asked now i added angrily wondering why oliver and percy chose the worst times to support each other no percy said hastily i just think that i shook my head slowly unbelievable you broke up with penelope for the same reason percy didntanswer you are both so alike as much as the two of you hate each other and like to think you re completely different people you are both idiots penelope agreed that then she an idiot too we both wanted to succeed idiots i repeated call wood whatever you d like but just when i thought you were starting to become the friend i used to have i never changed laura percy said you just finally saw what everyone else sees i d intended to keep interrupting him to give him a hard time because i couldntsay these things to oliver i hadntexpected percy to take what i said quite so personally or literally you have changed i said quietly after the fight with oliver you became less social after dan died you became even more focused on the future than you had been percy didntrespond and i always saw what everyone else saw no one else looked for more percy not only looked away but looked as far away from me as he could that not true i said penelope probably saw more too percy nodded but didntturn his head i sighed loudly and slumped further into the sofa the fire was almost out and it was rather cold in the common room well i said just to be saying something at least we re still friends we ve still got that even if you and oliver are complete idiots percy laughed under his breath turning to look back at the burning embers i never really realized how much of a difference one friendship makes until this week i didnthave penelope to talk to and i didnthave you to talk to is that why you started talking to me again this week i asked not unkindly or defensively just curiously probably percy admitted that and i could finally understand how lonely you must have been when you befriended oliver so i guess it was harder to blame you for choosing him it was harder to stay angry i understand i think that what made it easier for me to forgive oliver i started getting teary eyes again and it pissed me off damn it i cannot stop crying percy didntanswer i looked intently straight ahead blinking several times doing my best not to cry even more i was tired of crying i was sad yes of course but i was also mad at oliver whenever i get mad enough i cry which invariably makes me even angrier so i was losing my fight against my tears and percy took my hand gently but awkwardly at first i looked down and couldnthelp thinking it looked rather strange i was used to seeing my hand surrounding his as much as my hand could cover his larger one seeing percy hand surrounding mine was the last straw and i started crying normally tears silently falling i leaned over so my head was resting against percy shoulder he flinched at first but he made no other objection despite his warning two months earlier not to come crying to him when oliver ended the relationship after all percy said he hadntreally meant it he didntthink it would happen i didntthink it would happen either i fully admitted to myself for the first time i d pictured oliver and me together for the rest of our lives it wasntuntil i d left oliver by the window that i d understood that breaking up meant forever wouldnthappen after several minutes i stopped crying feeling just as miserable about the break up but much better about my friendship with percy wordlessly percy and i agreed that it was time to try to sleep again and we stood and walked to our separate doors see you in the morning percy said yes good night i walked upstairs and went straight to bed falling asleep in my clothes and shoes for the second time that night i slept in considerably later than i normally did which was hardly later than most people slept when there were no classes the bathroom was relatively empty which i was thankful for because it meant there were less people to give me sympathetic looks as i d expected news of oliver breaking up with me had traveled fast i decided it probably was a bad idea to have important conversations in the corridors where ghosts and paintings the backbone of hogwarts gossip chain were i decided i would have future conversations in classrooms then remembered that in a couple of days it would no longer matter i started walking down to the great hall alone for the first time in quite a while i was brooding on this feeling quite sorry for myself when someone voice interrupted my self pity lo laura i looked to my left to see that penelope clearwater had joined my previously lone trek to breakfast i had to blink a few times my brain not quite registering who my new companion was penelope and i had gotten used to not wanting much to do with each other i partially blamed her for percy ditching me and she knew i partially blamed her hi penelope i said several seconds too late for it to sound natural how d your exams go she asked politely well yours well i dontmind tests much she said it didntsurprise me that this ravenclaw head girl didntmind taking exams it did surprise me she was insisting on carrying on small talk with me there was a pause which i couldnthelp think seemed more awkward to penelope than it did to me i heard about you and oliver she said so that what the small talk had really been about penelope felt bad for me it took me a few seconds to realize i felt bad for her too percy told me the two of you broke up as well i said looks as if the two of us have quite a bit in common i put as much humor in my statement as i could i knew that neither of us expected to ever have much of anything in common with each other yes penelope agreed did you really agree with the whole focusing on our careers argument i asked she thought a moment yes another pause and no i smiled then i apologize for calling you an idiot last night she returned the smile and i could tell she d thought of similar names for percy in some ways the argument does make some sense doesntit shouldntwe all be focusing on our careers yes i admitted but the logic only really works if you say that one can only focus on one thing that it even possible to focus on one thing people are always balancing things such as work friends family hobbies and so on that true penelope said and who on earth wants his life to be nothing but work oliver and percy penelope said blandly the two of us had slowed our walking considerably people passed us frequently but quickly casting sad glances in my direction why didntyou tell oliver all of this penelope asked i tried i was too angry to really think of arguments at the time i smiled bitterly i ve had quite enough time since then to form some arguments though she laughed but understandingly and without much humor it too late now i said you could always talk to him about it again i made a face beg oliver to take me back i asked no make him see he was an idiot i shook my head you dontknow oliver anyway you re one to talk i dontsee you trying to convince percy he was wrong you do know percy she said simply right oliver just as stubborn anyway penelope said a part of me does see percy reasoning i want to succeed too i do too but i know we can succeed and be together so tell him that what do you have to lose penelope asked pride pride yes i said that it i looked at her as if she d said the sky was purple with pink polka dots and really believed it to be true that enough i said penelope was confused so you ll put pride ahead of love i put pride ahead of everything you put success ahead of love yes but at least that almost logical better than pride i half smiled you wouldntunderstand you arenta gryffindor we walked down the stairs in silence and i thought about what i d said i had never tied pride to being in gryffindor before but once i said it aloud the link suddenly seemed obvious before going into the forbidden forest oliver and i had seriously wondered why the sorting hat had put us into gryffindor we couldntthink of any instances in our lives when we d done anything worthy of being called brave hardly any eleven year olds have so the sorting hat must be looking for something else a potential to be brave a large amount of pride must surely be a signal for the hat take the clich of a brave act running into a burning building to save a stranger a ravenclaw wouldntbe stupid enough to risk his or her life the odds of not surviving would be obvious to the ravenclaw the ravenclaw would know it is much more practical to let professionals save the stranger and running into the building may just make it so the professionals have to save one more person a slytherin might risk his or her life to save a stranger if the slytherin thought about how the attention afterwards might help him or her however a slytherin would see that there is nothing to gain from dying a hufflepuff would run into the building without thinking about it if someone he or she loved was threatened by the flames yet the hufflepuff loyalty to those he loves would make it hard for him or her to risk his life for strangers a gryffindor would run into that burning building because not running in would kill the gryffindor more easily than risking his or her life the gryffindor could not live with him or herself if he or she didnttry to help for good or selfish reasons not to try would hurt the gryffindor pride too much the people in all four houses make good decisions about whether or not to save the stranger but it is the gryffindor who would be praised the brave side of pride is considered a virtue that the kind of pride i think godric gryffindor valued unfortunately the same pride that makes gryffindors brave is the same pride that makes us stubborn stupid asses most of the big problems in my life were caused by it at least partially every time it took me too long to forgive a friend because i wouldntapologize first every time i silently cried myself to sleep instead of showing some weakness to someone even when i asked dan to meet me in the field behind the burrow because i would have been to embarrassed to kiss him in front of his family and now i was going to let oliver dump me for a stupid reason because my pride wouldntlet me plead with him to change his mind of course oliver pride wouldnthave let him listen and admit he had been wrong after all he was a gryffindor too so i wouldnttry to make him come around knowing pride made percy oliver and me unreasonable didntchange anything we were how we were i didnthave to like it penelope and i walked into the great hall i was trying to figure out if our conversation was over debating whether i could just walk over to gryffindor table without another word well good luck in the future penelope said i smiled and nodded same to you she walked away to sit with her ravenclaw friends and for a moment i felt lost habit was drawing me to sit with most of the seventh year gryffindors as i had every morning for breakfast but i didntfeel up to trying to have a normal conversation especially because oliver was already eating with them i started walking to gryffindor table scanning for empty seats percy was near the end of the table not close to anyone i quickly walked past my other friends and chose a seat directly across from percy percy looked up and for a moment appeared to be surprised morning i said morning he said smiling slightly he turned his gaze back to the daily prophet i missed the mail delivery i said you can see the paper after i through with it percy said thanks i started filling my plate with food what are we going to do today no classes homework or exams percy shrugged still reading anything interesting happening just more articles about how black somehow escaped the other night fudge is blaming dumbledore for everything i blew air out of my nose dismissively dumbledore wouldnthelp a mass murderer escape percy raised his eyebrows but kept reading i sighed and started eating my eggs and toast i rather missed the conversations with the other seventh years hadntpercy and my conversations been less one sided in the past surely they had been an owl delivered your paper to our part of the table while you were upstairs joan said taking a seat next to me and placing the newspaper in front of her you owe oliver a knut oh i said reaching into my pocket and pulling out a few coins i found a knut and tried to hand it to joan give it to him yourself she said smiling meaningfully i put the knut on top of the paper take the knut or give him the paper he paid for i said simply joan took the coin and placed it in her pocket we re all going to hogsmeade this afternoon most of the seventh years are going as there really nothing here to do now you re welcome to join us she turned her head to face percy both of you percy turned the page of his paper donttry to fix this one joan i said seriously fix what joan said you know what you can still be friends with oliver joan said not the day after they broke up percy said turning another page joan ignored him oliver wontmind if you go he ll mind if i go percy said thank you for offering joan i said but i dontwant to make all of you uncomfortable you won t all right then i dontwant to be uncomfortable i said she looked slightly hurt and i sure she wanted me to see that look i said maybe we ll see you in town i tried to compromise joan nodded and smiled she stood up said goodbye and left she irritating percy said finally tearing his eyes from the prophet sometimes i admitted but she means well percy rolled his eyes you dontlike her because everyone considers her to be the nice prefect percy grinned i nice i laughed and he started looking at another section of the paper smiling that afternoon percy and i did decide to visit hogsmeade for a change of scenery it may have been our second to last full day at hogwarts but that didntchange the fact that we d spent hundred of days there for a couple of hours percy and i browsed through several of the shops on the main street of town spending more time than i d have liked in the bookstore i was glad not to be staring at common room walls but hogsmeade had lost a lot of its appeal after four years of hogsmeade weekends after percy finally found a book with a ministry worker as the main character we went to the three broomsticks for a butterbeer and snack we waited at the counter after ordering and after receiving our drinks and food started making our way to the back of the pub there werentmany people in the three broomsticks but percy and i were used to being there when the place was packed and finding seats in back was easier laura you showed up joan said happily as percy and i were walking by her table percy and i stopped walking both reluctantly though i was slightly better at hiding it i d known the others were in town but it hadntcrossed my mind that the gryffindors would likely be at this pub when we got there percy had asked if i wanted to get a butterbeer and i d agreed to it everything had felt normal while the two of us window shopped but we d hardly talked i thought sitting down somewhere might help the conversation did you hear about professor lupin mark asked looking up at percy and me i shook my head turns out he a werewolf mark said you re kidding i said raising my eyebrows in surprise explains all of the disappearances doesntit cedar asked so i suppose he leaving percy asked yes dontthink many parents would want their kids being taught by a dark creature mark said which is too bad they ll probably end up with another teacher like lockhart oliver said well no one expected lupin to last more than one year cedar said i nodded in agreement as did the others on mark and joan side of the table the only place i d looked since joan had called my attention to them there was a short silence which i spent nodding slowly looking anywhere but at the people sitting opposite joan well let not let our drinks get warm percy said i increased the speed of my nodding yes we ll see you all later only if you ll look at each other cedar muttered i didntlook at her she was on the other side of the table or acknowledge she d said anything instead i followed percy to a corner of the pub where thankfully we could not see our classmates well that was awkward percy said i know i muttered thank merlin you didntaccept joan offer to tag along with them and drag me along with you i didntsay anything telling him to shut up would have only told him i agreed with his statement not saying anything did the same i figured it was best to save my breath it would have been interesting to see if you and wood could have gone a whole day without looking at each other though shut up percy i said i had plenty of time to save my breath in the long silence that followed he hadntsaid anything to be mean but i took his comment badly anyway i spent half an hour drinking butterbeer trying to ignore sounds of conversation coming from the other gryffindors table and avoiding eye contact with percy about five minutes after my friends left the pub percy and i started talking again and decided to head back to the castle we managed to have a decent conversation on the way back though it was mainly small talk it was a nice evening so most of the student body went outside and percy and i were no exceptions at first he read while i people watched there was plenty going on in the grounds to keep me from becoming bored after an hour or so of people watching i saw hagrid working near the lake and it hit me that i may not see him again before i left the school i going to go say goodbye to hagrid want to come percy looked up from his book no thanks i ve never really talked to him it not too late to meet him properly how do you know him i didntwant percy to feel bad about anything i knew he was sorry for so i just shrugged and said not sure go ahead i ll wait for you here before going inside i agreed to this arrangement and walked from an area near the doors of the castle to where hagrid was working lo hagrid i said hagrid turned and beamed ello laura i was wonderin if ya d come say goodbye of course i would i said though it hadntoccurred to me until i d seen him from across the grounds so ow are ya doin he asked standing up straight turning his attention from whatever he was working on oh you know i said shrugging something wrong i looked up at him taken a bit off guard i thought he d have heard most people in the school knew about the break up because oliver was involved where oliver hagrid asked looking over my head and scanning the grounds quickly i not sure we broke up hagrid looked adequately surprised and after he asked i explained oliver rationale oliver made puddlemere hagrid asked after i finished good fer im great i said not hiding my sarcasm well hagrid smiled probably not easy fer ya to be excited fer im i was excited for him now he not completely wrong hagrid said carefully yer careers are importan i know i said begrudgingly but you know he not completely right either i think e mainly wrong hagrid said i smiled thankfully i coul talk ter im hagrid offered no thanks it worked las time you gave him the same talk about fate and choices you gave me didntyou yes hagrid said i thought you did we talked for several minutes about what i was planning to do after graduation and about recent events at hogwarts hagrid knew more about professor lupin resignation than mark had told us and hagrid was happy to share most of what he knew with me though not as happy as he was to talk about buckbeak survival when signs of sunset started showing i decided i d better go back to percy thank you for everything hagrid i said oh yer welcome i enjoy getting ter know the students especially those who need you i asked smiling mostly hagrid admitted well i could still never thank you enough i blinked back a few tears and was doing well until hagrid wiped his own eye good luck with the rest of the students i said sincerely oh they jus need someone ter listen write ter me when ya get on with the prophe i will i said well i ll see you around hagrid bye laura hagrid said patting my shoulder probably with more force than he meant to i started walking away but there was still one more thing i wanted to know hagrid i asked stopping about five feet away from him and facing him after he looked up i continued i know this probably isntgoing to help me much but did you really know all along that oliver and i would date hagrid laughed but not enough to make me feel stupid for asking the question o course i did aren doubtin me are ya no but how d you know you jus fit the pattern is all i happens a lot when there a group of three an one of em isn the same gender usually the pairing doesn involve the leader if you will how often does this happen i asked skeptically often enough fer the professors to star noticin hagrid said of course i did consider you an percy i made a face no that would just be wrong i said quickly hagrid laughed so i had pretty good odds on you an oliver i guess i admitted well that all i wanted i dontblame ya fer askin if ya ever need anythin just ask ok thanks goodbye hagrid good luck hagrid said turning back to his work i walked back to where i d left percy he d repositioned himself to get better light so he could continue reading i was about to see if you d gone in already percy said standing we walked up to gryffindor and i filled him in on the professor lupin news on the way i spent the rest of the evening packing everything but a few changes of clothes and toiletries as did the rest of the gryffindor seventh year girls they were still in great moods because n e w t s were over and their happiness spread easily to me we gossiped about people in other houses and years avoiding talking about oliver and the other seventh year boys because oliver could be mentioned for my sake the next morning after breakfast with percy i got ready to go to graduation with the rest of the seventh years we had to wear our dress robes even though there was no actual ceremony the kids with wizards for parents didntseem to mind the lack of ceremony but the muggleborns felt as if there should be more pomp or circumstance or something the nine of us seventh years met in the common room oliver and i stayed on opposite sides of the group but we didntpretend as if the other person wasntthere he half smiled and nodded at me when i came down with the other girls and i did something that probably looked more like a grimace than the smile i d meant to give him after several minutes of small talk amongst the group it was finally time to walk down to professor mcgonagall office percy and i walked in the back of the group and oliver walked directly in front of us about halfway to mcgonagall office oliver turned his head seems strange this is our last day here doesntit he asked yeah i said simply very strange he nodded as if i d said something new instead of just agreeing he kept his head partially turned for a minute before completely facing forward again when your quidditch tryout i asked trying to sound politely interested and not angry i did well enough in a few days july third oliver said still facing forward i nodded even though he couldntsee me that when my interview for the prophet is really oliver asked well that ironic percy said i d forgotten he d been walking right next to me i scowled at him shut up percy oliver said percy didntrespond but only because we d all reached mcgonagall office and she was standing outside of the room to greet us she looked much happier and less strict than she normally did she didntlook happy to be rid of us but happy for us i suppose there must be as much pride in helping a student succeed as there is in succeeding as a student there were enough chairs in professor mcgonagall small office that all of us could sit but the room was crowded i ended up between percy and oliver briefly i thought it was strange to be close to oliver and not holding his hand or touching him professor mcgonagall chased the thought away when she began congratulating us on graduating then she explained that we all could practice magic legally whenever we pleased so long as we abided by ministry laws she passed out certificates with our names written on them sophisticatedly that said in flowery language that we d met all of hogwarts requirements to leave the school then she shook our hands congratulated us all again and sent us on our way i was sad about leaving the school in which i d spent seven years of my life but such a disappointing end to the experience was enough to make me tear up on the way back to the dormitories ok percy whispered fine i responded no one else could see me since percy and i again were bringing up the rear of the group and by the time we reached the dormitory to change out of our dress robes i didntfeel like crying anymore percy and i spent our last day exploring the castle and grounds for the last time over the course of the day things seemed more and more normal between us things would never be quite the same as they had been when percy and i had been each other only friend i knew that once percy got a job at the ministry it would become his life our friendship would always be formal continued only through letters exchanged infrequently because neither of us would be able to let go of the past quite enough to lose touch completely i think percy sensed the same things i suspected about our future so for one day we pretended nothing had happened since our first year for one last day we were new students in a strange school happy to have a new friend if i were to write out a list of every thing i would change about my time at hogwarts i d be writing for a week but i would leave that last day exactly how it was dreadful graduation and all the next thing i knew percy and i were on the hogwarts express heading back to london and i wasntsure if it was all too soon or just in time percy clearly believed it was the latter and we spent hours talking about what we expected in our futures it was a nice change for the two of us to forget about the past few weeks and to focus on the coming years percy was as optimistic about his future as ever i was just as willing to start over again about an hour before the train arrived at its destination percy and i were interrupted by a knock on the door of our compartment which was near the front of the train joan stuck her head in after i reached over and slid open the door something wrong percy asked in his head boy voice which he rarely turned off no nothing in one more hour no more prefect duty she said to percy taking her prefect badge off her gown if you hated it so much why did you do it percy asked watching her take off the symbol of her authority as if she were removing her right hand looks good on a resume she said honestly sitting next to him you arentglad to be done patrolling the corridors in the middle of the night i wontmiss that no percy said smiling a little after a minute of silence he said did you want something joan turned to me were you going to come say goodbye to us all i said goodbye to you this morning in the common room you didntsay goodbye to the boys i didntthink they d appreciate a teary goodbye from me anyway i ll see them again we ve never said goodbye over vacations before i said laughing it not a vacation joan said i know but it not forever either i interrupted are you really going to refuse to come with me to say goodbye because of oliver joan said disdainfully yes well that rather immature isntit she asked after a pause yes i admitted you cantignore him forever she said they spoke this morning percy said almost hiding a smirk joan blew air out of her nose hardly your shoe is untied doesntcount why do you care so much i asked exasperatedly you re my friend and isntthat enough of a reason for me to care she asked you cared before we were friends all right then i care because oliver my friend how long is this conversation going to last before you agree to go say goodbye to your friends as you should percy asked me joan looked at him smiled and nodded see even he things you should come thanks for your help percy i grumbled he shrugged and picked up the book sitting next to him that had been closed for the majority of the journey just seems rather stupid to drag some friends into a fight with another friend doesntit it wasnthard to guess what to what he was referring this is completely different i said i still think it was completely different i stood up and followed joan into the corridor anyway i felt as if i was going to throw up the chocolate frogs i d eaten that evening for dinner i tried to convince myself it was only motion sickness from walking in the opposite direction the train was going and maybe that was part of my problem the majority of my discomfort was from knowing how awkward the next few minutes could be joan walked into the seventh year gryffindors compartment ahead of me there wasnttruly enough room for all of us in the small space so i stood partially in the doorway partially in the hallway she had to drag you to come see us cedar asked she sounded as if she was kidding but her eyes looked at me seriously i didntwant to leave percy alone i lied so i shouldntstay long the group let my lie pass but they didntsay anything else either i looked around the compartment everyone was looking at me or at oliver oliver was looking at his shoes i ll miss you all i said to break the silence they mumbled responses i ll see you soon i said silently cursing how awkward the situation was thank you i added for what adam asked i smiled for putting up with me for the past several months oh adam said well we ve been putting up with you for much longer than several months it been seven years it was adam way of saying i d been in their lives longer than i d been their friend he meant it in a good way all right i conceded thanks for putting up with me more than usual during the last several months you re welcome mark said grinning you know what i d like to see for old times sake oliver and laura fighting like they used to joan hit him in the arm with considerable force i was only kidding mark said they know that i glanced at oliver and for the first time in a couple of days we made eye contact we both looked away quickly but i felt less uncomfortable i d been dreading that moment and now it was over good luck in the next few months i said to the room at large less restrictedly than i d been talking before they wished me the same keep in touch they promised they would joan stood up and hugged me and tara followed joan example i returned the gesture gratefully let us know when your first story is in the prophet mark said easily reaching across the small space between his seat by the window to where i was standing he shook my hand and while it wasntas nice as a hug it was still a kind gesture coming from him adam stood and turned away suddenly i can t saying goodbye is just too hard we all laughed because adam had said it more than because it was funny i laughed the loudest glad he was making everything less serious i ll come see one of your plays i said as he turned back and gave me a friendly hug only one he asked smiling maybe he was serious it was hard to tell write to me cedar said standing and hugging me awkwardly rose stood as well and we exchanged a short hug had rose not found me crying a couple of days before i think she would have shaken my hand as mark did good luck with marcus i whispered and i meant it thank you she said sitting back down i paused suddenly uncertain what to do thankfully my emotions couldnttop my very basic manners i faced oliver good luck with puddlemere i said and i meant that too almost as sincerely as i wished i could mean it thank you oliver said he stood and reached out his hand and it struck me as a cold gesture i took his hand anyway neither of us shook our hands you ll do amazingly at the paper thanks he dropped my hand but remained standing keep in touch laura i nodded and turned my attention back to everyone we ll be back in london soon i d best get back to my compartment see you all later i said they said goodbye as i left their area i was sad to be leaving them relieved to be finished with telling them that i was sad percy put his book away when i came back to our compartment how d it go he asked remember the conversation in the three broomsticks the other day percy snorted i dontthink i ll ever forget well this one was about like that that bad it could have been even worse than it was i sighed percy didntsay anything for a minute there only about ten minutes left until we reach king cross i need to make sure everything fine you re leaving i asked looking down at him sadly he paused i suppose i wontbe able to do anything even if something is wrong probably not i agreed then i ll stay i smiled the two of us threw a few random items including our robes back into our trunks with the rest of our luggage the train started slowing down percy and i watched parts of london go by and soon we were looking at a wall inside of king cross the two of us got our trunks down from the shelf above our heads helping each other because they were heavy the front of the train was almost as empty as the back of the train so we got off the locomotive quickly percy spotted his family almost immediately their red hair making them easy to see in a crowd i followed him to greet them it had been a long time since i d talked to them in person hello laura mrs weasley greeted me hugging me as she did almost everyone my age you ve gotten so old not as old as we ve gotten mr weasley said smiling other weasley children reached our small group and the weasley parents attention was taken away from me it didntbother me much well i should go find my parents too i said looking up at percy he nodded i ll see you soon if you re not working i kidded though i knew there was truth in my joke he grinned if we re not working i ll miss you perce our trunks were on the ground and my arms were free i hugged him quickly and he returned the hug with one arm his other hand was holding hermes cage i ll miss you too he said as i backed away again to give him his space i nodded once and magicked my trunk onto a cart someone had brought over that was mine george or fred said hers now said the other i thanked the one who d gotten the cart for himself and he accepted my thanks rather well i ll see you percy i said getting behind the cart and directing it towards the line of people waiting to leave platform 9 goodbye i started to walk away but stopped when he said my name again i d have never made it without you he said quietly after catching up so his family couldnthear i smiled broadly we re even then i said as the people in front of me left the platform i took one last look at the hogwarts express i thought about how i would probably never see it again it let out a whistle and i imagined that it was saying goodbye it wasntuntil i was on the other side of the barrier that it occurred to me that many wizards saw that train again when their children saw it for the first time mum and dad saw me and started waving and the thought left my mind as i greeted them author note sorry for the long wait for this chapter school started again on the other hand this chapter was long enough to be two or three chapters but i didntwant to make people wait longer for them hope you enjoyed this latest installment coming up laura goes out into the real world gets a job and then discovers a career the characters all meet up again for animportant event author note you may remember that there was a chapter near the beginning of the story that i called a transition chapter this is another one of those i could have summed up what happens in this chapter within a page but i think a lot would have been lost hope you agree and if you re unfamiliar with the term gopher it refers to a person who runs errands gopher this gopher that chapter 14 developing well miss debman i have to be honest with you there really are no positions open at the prophet right now mr barnabas cuffe lifted a foot off the floor and raised it to the point where when he bent down slightly he could pick up his leg and place his ankle on top of his knee satisfied he leaned back as much as he could in his straight backed professional looking chair the desk between the two of us was spotless though the desk in the back of the room which he clearly used to do his work was quite cluttered you re qualified to work here your o w l s were very good and the preliminary results of your n e w t s suggest your final scores there will be quite good as well he continued he tapped his fingers on an arm of the chair his other hand rested on top of his ankle i disliked him he held my future in his hands yet he seemed unconcerned he was powerful and he knew it he didntenjoy it perhaps years ago he d enjoyed being able to determine what happened in others lives now affecting people lives was as commonplace to him as magic of course you donteven know what it is you want to do here cuffe said if i had some idea i d know whether or not we could afford to open another position for you i ll do anything i said honestly anything the editor of the daily prophet asked raising an eyebrow you d be a janitor i didntanswer right away i knew he was just testing me but i didntwant to end up cleaning toilets mere days after working so hard to perform well on my n e w t s if cleaning is the only way to work for your paper i ll clean mr cuffe smiled he knew i didntreally mean it i passed his test anyway there is one position i can offer you it isntglamorous however you d see bits of what most of the people who work in this building do sounds perfect i said praying i wouldntbe bringing all of the people in the building coffee or tea basically you d be a bit of a gopher cuffe said shifting in his uncomfortable seat anyone who needed a bit of help would come to you so i d do all of the jobs no one else wants i asked before i could stop myself cuffe laughed something like that honestly reporters might ask you to check facts or set appointments for interviews photographers might ask you to help them develop film advertising specialists might ask you to write bills and send them everyone will ask you to run errands so i will be getting coffee for everyone i thought as i said it isnta glamorous job on the other hand you could discover how else you might be an asset to our paper cuffe laughed look at it this way you can only be promoted there nothing to be demoted to he laughed again at his own joke i forced a smile when can i start next week cuffe said uncrossing his legs monday seven a m you ll start at one and a half times minimum wage raises come with each promotion you ll have your own desk at the back of the main office space one hour break at lunch work ends at six p m unless production is running behind schedule as it always is but you ll get paid for overtime two weeks vacation a year any questions any benefits i asked cuffe snorted you re a muggleborn i take it i nodded you re going to pay so many taxes to the ministry you ll wish you had less benefits oh i said simply any other questions the editor asked standing i shook my head and stood too no sir good i ll see you monday at seven he stuck his right hand out across the spotless desk i took his hand and made sure i shook his hand firmly remembering what i d heard about strong handshakes showing strong character thank you sir i said smiling thank you miss debman i left the office building of the daily prophet and walked into diagon alley it looked exactly the same as it had when i d walked into the office an hour previously but it had lost some of its magic diagon alley was no longer the place in which i had first encountered a new world of people i was suddenly a part of the new world i wasnta muggle with magical powers i was a witch diagon alley was now only slightly more glamorous than the local convenient store it was ironic to me that after spending seven years at hogwarts worrying that i would never really belong with wizards because i was a muggleborn graduating from hogwarts is what made me feel like a true witch i never thought feeling like a witch would ever upset me it did because it upset my parents they could tell that i no longer felt as if i was a part of their world it hurt me that i didnt want to be i spent the next week finding an apartment if my parents resented the wizarding world for any one thing it was that children came of age one year early i thought about staying with them but i felt strange being a legal adult living in my parents home sure i was going to be financially relying on them for several months while i got on my feet but i wanted to feel a little independent i found a run down one person flat in london that was near the leaky cauldron it was cheap and convenient so i barely hesitated to sign the lease i moved out on my own two days before i started work mum and dad helped me arrange everything the week passed and my first monday as a daily prophet employee began i got ready carefully wanting to make a good impression on the people i d be working with i figured that if everyone there could tell me what to do it would probably be to my benefit for the people there to like me i felt somewhat immature caring so much about what the others thought of me after all i was going to start making my own money i was living alone in a shabby flat i was seventeen and a legal adult werentadults supposed to be confident enough in themselves to know that an extra ten minutes in front of the mirror isntgoing to make people like them any better i walked into the daily prophet office appearing as confident as possible i d learned the trick from percy he could pretend as if nothing was bothering him quite well strangers usually fell for his act i always wondered whether or not the weasleys could see through it i found my desk easily mr cuffe had given a good description of its location at the end of my interview the desk was in the very back of the crowded main office area i immediately wondered why i hadntthought of bringing anything to put on the desk all the office had supplied was a small nameplate a stack of rolls of blank parchment a couple of quills and a half empty bottle of ink i walked around the desk and saw the only part of my space i actually liked the chair i d been afraid everyone would have a straight backed chair like the editor s i was happy to see a simple office chair i sat down and tested its ability to roll recline and swivel i take it the chair is to your liking someone said as i was discovering that the chair could make four full circles with one push off the desk i put both feet down quickly coming to an abrupt stop with my back to the speaker i had to turn to see the person i turned bright red when as i d feared the editor was looking down at me sorry mr cuffe i mumbled not a problem you young ones right out of hogwarts are always interesting he laughed that us i said growing redder i ve let the office know you re here at their disposal the mornings will probably start out slowly late afternoon when we re scrambling with the last few stories is when things get interesting is there anything you d like me to do now i asked oh stick close to your desk and i sure someone will find something for you to do ok cuffe left without another word it was nice of him to come see me on my first day or maybe he d just been checking to see if i d shown up on time either way i didntthink any better of him than i had during our interview i spent an hour staring off into space and rearranging the blank parchments in the drawers of my small desk i could have gotten some entertainment from the office chair but i was too afraid i d get caught spinning around in circles again finally a middle aged woman with black hair and white rimmed glassed came smiling up to my desk i smiled back thankful to be getting any attention you re the new gopher she asked i nodded and kept smiling pretty much i stood and offered my hand to her i laura debman she took my hand and shook it once before letting go i melissa furthing i write for the business section of the paper i have a little errand for you great i said happy to end my count of how many windows were in the room all of the windows faced diagon alley later i learned this was true of every room in the building there was nothing on the other side of the office to look at after all there had to be boundaries to diagon alley somewhere ms furthing handed me a sealed envelope please take this to mr ollivander you know who that is the wand maker i said doing quite well at hiding any signs that the question was insulting i took the letter yes and please take this she produced another sealed letter to the owl post and mail it priority just tell the clerk it for the prophet they ll put it on our bill ok i said taking the second parchment why dontwe just mail the letters from here i asked my curiosity getting ahead of my tact melissa false smile became rather thin the owl post owls are more reliable than any animals we could get plus it more professional to use the mail service and we d need dozens of owls to send all of the mail the paper sends every day what would the office look like if we had owls flying in and out at every moment a part of me understood and agreed with her points the other and larger part of me was thinking about all of the letters that i was going to be running to the owl post months later i learned that the woman was wrong all businesses in diagon alley had to use the owl post so that the clerks there could control the number of owls leaving diagon alley to avoid drawing muggle attention to the area thankfully the owl post was only approximately the equivalent of a city block away from the prophet office i spent the rest of the morning running similar errands most of the errands were related to the paper some were related to me getting food for others in the office one errand involved me checking on a sick iguana at the wizard veterinary office i was thankful to be undisturbed during my lunch break in a general staff lounge in the basement that afternoon i was able to help with something more directly linked with the production of the paper how do you feel about fact checking a younger wizard asked as he walked up to my desk his appearance could be summed up as slightly above average slightly taller than average slightly thinner than average slightly more handsome than average i shrugged er rather apathetic he asked smiling kindly his smile was the only thing about him that stood out if that i admitted smiling back he laughed too bad come with me i stood up and followed him across the office i took the opportunity to look around more closely my desk provided a poor view of the goings on in the office there was a false wall about ten feet in front of my part of the office which made it so i could only see the upper half of the large room since owls were unwelcome in the building the upper half of the room was rather uneventful i could see some of the windows facing the street that was all first day the man asked without turning yes enjoying it yes i lied good he stopped in front of a table with some copies of newspaper pages and piles of parchments stuffed in large folders scattered across it all right this is tomorrow sports section the magic in our printers eliminates grammatical errors but cantcheck to see if what written is true and it cantcheck the spellings of proper names so read the articles quickly but carefully when you come across a name or place or time or any statistical or factual piece of information check it against our sources he said pointing to the stacks of folders which were labeled neatly or the network i sorry the network the informational network he said i raised an eyebrow oh merlin all right i ll give you a quick introduction to the network you ll have to figure out the rest on your own he reached across the table and opened the largest book i d ever seen the book was easily two feet thick with a length of over two feet and a width of over one foot upon opening the book i saw that the pages inside were thin and completely blank tap the book with your wand the man said ok i said nodding to show that i understood the first step he laughed no i mean actually tap the book with your wand oh i tapped the book lines started appearing on the two pages the book was opened to but the lines didntform words or diagrams each line about an inch long would appear slowly on one of the two pages the book was open to but would disappear as soon as the line completely showed itself now take out a quill he said a quill yes a quill you do know what a quill is dontyou he meant it teasingly but i took it personally of course i said blushing i just didntbring a quill over here i ll go get one i said turning from the table to make my way back to my desk no need the man said he stepped quickly walked around a fake wall that was a few feet behind him and came back with a quill and a bottle of red ink use these he said handing the materials across the table i took the quill dipped it in the ink and then looked up for directions now just write what you want to know he said raising a hand as if he were offering something to no one in particular i stared down at the massive book at the moment the only thing i wanted to know was why no one at hogwarts had ever told us about the informational network write your own name in the book that will be a good example i followed the man directions and signed laura debman onto the top of the right hand page the lines that had been coming in and out of view froze while i wrote as soon as i lifted my quill away from the parchment the lines quickly flowed together to form words laura anne debman 17 daily prophet london laura sybil debman deceased ministry of magic london laura winfred debman 79 muggle devon then either take the quill and write the full name of the person you want to learn more about or take your wand and tap his or her name i tapped my name with my wand the words broke into lines again and then started forming new words within seconds there was one page of statistics about my life the book seemed to know everything important that had ever happened to me numerous books similar to this one make up the informational network the prophet actually has several books both because we need to look up so much information and because the paper has to keep every newspaper article ever written on record our books are bigger than most because they have to store all of those articles the young man explained it all correct i said skimming the list of dates and names that were connected to me below the list of important dates which included anything newspaper worthy i d ever done was a list of my close relatives the muggle papers are in the network i noticed aloud yes and all of the muggle libraries all of the wizarding libraries are on the network too except hogwarts why not hogwarts they re rather old fashioned like their students to do as much work as possible he laughed i sure you ll attest to that i smiled yes i was just wondering why hogwarts didnthave a bunch of these things well they re rather expensive ordinary people donthave a book connected to the network hogwarts could afford them i said he nodded that true on a hunch i tapped on my mother name with my wand the page reformed itself to show her information which went onto the second page i see you re catching on quickly so i ll leave you to your fact checking ok i said looking up from the book and smiling thankfully thanks for your help not a problem the man started walking away quickly to do whatever it was he needed to be doing what your name i asked realizing that he d never told me the man turned his head and grinned you wontfind anything interesting about me in there he nodded towards the book oh i said only just realizing how powerful and slightly unnerving the network really was i wasntgoing to i just wanted to know your name i muttered he laughed i was giving you a hard time my name elliot murphy nice to meet you elliot i said you too laura he said nodding before hurrying away to do more work the verifying was slow going at first part of my problem was that i was unfamiliar with the network and with the filing system the prophet used to store their source materials after about two hours and two pages i was familiar enough with both systems that i couldntblame my lack of progress on not knowing what i was doing i just didntcare about what i was reading the sports section was the part of the newspaper i used to give to whoever asked for it first i rarely even read the headlines now i was being forced to read details of minor league quidditch matches probable outcomes of upcoming hippogriff races new models of broomsticks and other such nonsense i grabbed the third page of sports section and almost whimpered i was only half way through the section and i knew i was helping the paper very little if it kept talking me a whole afternoon to look over one small section on the paper i was going to lose my job the first headline i saw on the page did nothing to improve my mood puddlemere names new reserve keeper wood former gryffindor captain excited i d thought a lot about oliver during the week while i had nothing better to do i d cried a little i d vented to my mum several times i d written half a dozen nasty letters and incinerated them quickly both to feel better and to stop myself from sending them to oliver i hadntthought of oliver once that day up to that point i was too busy worrying about looking as if i deserved my job i skimmed the article about oliver and the anger i d felt during the past week surged back wood says he couldnthave made it to the big time without the help of his family my dad who played quidditch himself when he was young made all the difference without his support i d never be sitting here talking to you today he went on to say his friends at hogwarts also helped him greatly my friends were all very supportive of my decision to play quidditch professionally all of them understood that i ve been working for this my whole life honestly i think they were happier than i was when i heard the news what i asked aloud happy i scooted the chair i was sitting in away from the table i dontremember being very happy about it happy about what a man who looked as if he was in his mid or late twenties asked walking up to the desk he had a camera case slung over one of his shoulders and was holding a single photograph in his hand he moved awkwardly his movements rather exaggerated almost like prey that is very aware of its surroundings he put his camera case on the table and ran a hand through his dirty blonde hair self consciously nothing i said just talking to myself i wondered if i was going to say anything intelligent that day what article were you reading the man asked slightly turning the page i d been looking at he skimmed over the top of the page this article he asked guessing correctly yes i said seeing no way out of telling the truth then you know him he asked holding up a picture i looked more closely oliver was standing proudly in robes of blue i could see a gold symbol on his chest i did i said i was surprised by my own answer the man blinked i see he took his photograph of oliver and placed it on an empty space of the page that i was supposed to be proofreading took me forever to track down this broadsheet it usually past this stage by now i groaned inwardly and felt even worse about how slowly i was moving granted this man wasnthelping me the photographer decided the photograph was too big he took out his wand and waved it a bit in the direction of the picture the image of oliver shrunk a little the man nodded satisfied and tapped the wand quickly and rather harshly on the photo which melted into the paper for a moment i forgot the subject of the picture impressed with what i d just seen know him well the man asked stepping back from the table but still looking at the picture probably making sure it was centered small school not many people in our year less than normal i said dodging the question the man nodded once i see he repeated he smiled quickly i ll let you get back to your work i watched him leave and then looked back down at the third page of the sports section i sighed one good thing came out of the previous situation i was much more motivated to get to the fourth and final page of the job after finishing the sports section someone from the international section asked me to do the same thing i d just finished for her section of the paper i agreed happy to read about something that i was more concerned with my interest in the material helped me get through the international section more quickly the woman who d given me the assignment even gave me a compliment after i d finished every workday for the next month was very much like the first day i simply got better at living that day within a week of starting the job i cut down the amount of time it took me to fact check a section of the paper from four hours to just over an hour people started noticing so there was never a day when at least three sections didntask me to use the network to make sure everything in the paper was as true as we could get it thankfully most people in the office made me feel appreciated if they hadn t i probably would have quit after a few weeks of running errands and verifying information the work was boring the glamour of the network disappeared within days the glamour of working for the prophet disappeared within weeks living on my own only made things worse because i had no one to look forward to seeing after work i was still going home quite often for meals especially on weekends when i only worked a few hours in the afternoon about once a week i would be greeted by a letter from joan she was following through with her promise to stay in touch with everyone so she was able to keep me up to date with what the other gryffindors were up to mark and rose got lower jobs in the ministry but neither one was discouraged both of them were perfectly capable of moving up the ranks and they knew it mark and joan had decided to stop their off and on dating for good and joan told me she was glad i completely believed her rose was still dating flint who also worked for the ministry in his father department tara was enjoying herself at the flourish and blotts in hogsmeade she was hoping to be transferred to the diagon alley store within a year though it was unlikely that would happen even though her family owned the bookstore chain tara was still the lowest of the low she was happy not to be receiving special treatment adam was scouring the wizarding world for an acting job to make money he d gotten a job washing dishes at a muggle restaurant somewhere in london i was certain he was using magic when the muggles werentlooking joan expressed similar concerns though she was more apt to give adam the benefit of the doubt cedar was working for gringotts in diagon alley but i never saw her as i d feared before leaving school i had no reason to keep in touch with most of the old seventh years we d gotten along well in a group but i d never had time to make strong friendships with most of them joan had forced me into a friendship which i was glad to keep going after graduation i wrote back to her within a day of receiving each letter she said i was the best at keeping in touch the truth was that i was just trying to make her believe that her news about oliver wasntbothering me at all he was by far the gryffindor she told me the most about there was no more to tell about oliver career than the rest of ours he practiced quidditch every day with the team he traveled when the team wasntpracticing the reserve teams would play a match before the real games so people coming into the stadiums would have something to watch oftentimes the matches ended before the snitch was caught so that the real teams could start their games on time oliver didntcare he was doing well and was expected to substitute for the real puddlemere keeper soon i d already read this in the papers of course though i never told joan this i thought she d think i just didntwant to hear about oliver which was somewhat true but i didntwant her to know that either just when i thought that the rest of my time as the i prophet i gopher would be spent proofreading every article ever published by the paper and running back and forth between the diagon alley office and the owl post i finally was asked to do a different task excuse me i looked up from the network book i was using to check the home and home life section of the paper the voice had been unfamiliar but i recognized the man partially by the camera case hanging off his right shoulder it was the same photographer who d put oliver picture in the paper on my first day at the prophet i smiled at the man politely only because i automatically smiled at everyone at work really the memories of the not so good first day at the prophet and of oliver successful start to his career made me want to punch something may i help you i asked holding the smile yes erm i rather behind in developing my pictures i usually much more on top of it but i haventbeen in the office much and so i need help i have to finish this first i said motioning toward the newspaper section lying on the desk in front of me i d been following a first come first serve policy since i d started at the paper so no one could accuse me of favoring certain departments in the office it ll be about twenty minutes the photographer nodded once come down to the dark room when you ve finished oh erm knock first ok only where the dark room the basement in the back farthest from diagon alley i ll come down i promised and the young man walked away fifteen minutes later i was knocking on the door to what i hoped was the dark room coming dontcome in the door opened a sliver and a hand holding a wand popped into the hallway nox the lights in the hallway went out with a tiny pop hurry that charm is very temporary on anything other than wand light the photographer said closing the door right behind me the dark room looked similar to what i imagined muggle dark rooms look like red lights hovered near the ceiling so that people could work without compromising the black and white photographs pieces of photography paper floated in trays full of liquid on the worktables that lined the walls and the one larger table in the center of the room in one corner a few cauldrons brewed without giving off light and of course drying pictures hung from strings stretching from wall to wall we could dry them with magic but i think they turn out better if they air day most of the photographers think i mad but i convinced cuffe it was the best method so air drying is prophet policy now ian said seeing me tracing the lines of photographs with my eyes i nodded still looking around and i vaguely wondered why i wasntbored by the man rambling and the cauldrons potions for developing the pictures most of the ingredients are the same chemicals the muggles use to develop pictures some ingredients help the pictures move when we do charms on them and a couple are added so the potion doesntexplode i turned my attention to the photographer to see if he was serious he was but he d also said the last comment as a joke i recognized the dry sense of humor and laughed mainly at the familiarity the man smiled reminding me even more of percy i hoped for the photographer sake that he didnthave much else in common with my friend whom i d hardly heard from since graduation he d sent a short letter saying he d gotten a job at the ministry in the department for international cooperation and that they were busy preparing for something happening at hogwarts during the next school year after a few more lines teasing me about how he couldnttell someone who worked for the prophet information the ministry was trying to keep secret he d signed the letter i d sent a few more detailed letters to percy but had received no replies it was hardly a surprise but his lack of contact merely a month after the two of us left hogwarts angered me a bit i d thought he d put a bit of effort into staying in touch at first i was serious the potions will explode the man said i know you just reminded me of a friend a friend not oliver wood then i take it he said grinning and showing he remembered our first meeting no not oliver wood i agreed who then percy weasley i answered wondering why he even cared a weasley bill brother yes i said surprised you know bill course went to school with him i was a year older but seeing as we were both in the same house we knew each other rather well you were in gryffindor dontact so surprised please he said it pisses me off no no i said quickly i just dontremember you what your name ian mallory he said holding out his hand i guess i forgot to tell you that small detail upstairs that main area makes me nervous too much stress up there i shook ian hand i laura debman laura debman ian said slowly before shaking his head i afraid i dontremember you either well i was just a first year while you were there still i ll have to tell percy to tell bill i met you how are the weasleys alive i said automatically coming up with percy answer to the question ian frowned a bit didntdan pass away a few years ago oh i said caught off guard er yeah a few years ago broom accident i muttered i thought you meant more recently it been quite a long time since i talked to bill i guess probably haventseen him since the funeral ian coughed a bit anyway i should send him a note see what he up to i nodded ian looked at me closely for a moment then blinked and smiled have you ever developed pictures before no i said apologetically no problem making the potion is the hard part the rest is relatively simple i like relatively simple then you ll love this ian said i did love it i dontthink i d have called the process simple but it certainly wasntbrain surgery ian showed me quickly but in a plain manner that i could understand how to transfer the negative from the film to the photograph paper which involved two charms then he demonstrated how to place the photograph into the tray so that the negative would not be harmed he assured me the potion almost never explodes in the trays if it was going to blow up it would have done so in the cauldron not to worry potions was my second best subject we worked on those steps for about an hour before all of the pictures ian wanted to develop were properly in their separate trays when we finished ian said we d have to wait a few minutes before we could start hanging the photographs to dry well done ian said kindly i rather slow at it i apologized it fun though well maybe fun isntthe right term but it s better than looking up facts in the network all day i grinned ian laughed sympathetically i never was very interested in the writing side of news another reason i dontlike the main workspace of the office i donthate it i said hurriedly i dontmean to sound as if i hate it you didntsound as if you hated it ian smirked you merely sounded as if you didntparticularly like it i don t i admitted and sighed i ve always wanted to work here i didntpicture myself doing what i doing i suppose you wontbe doing what you re doing forever cuffe wonthave it the gophers dontstay gophers long they get promoted the ones that dontquit first yes ian said wonderful he laughed dontworry if the office didntlike you they d have made sure you d have quit by now he paused another reason i dontlike the main office area i smiled at him thankfully you really dontmind developing pictures ian asked no i like it i insisted then after i show you how to hang them up maybe you can come down and help out every now and then you know it might make things here better if you donthave to do the exact same thing every day and i would get to spend more time taking pictures and less time in the dark room i smiled genuinely that would be great ok then let get started again the process of hanging the photographs to dry was rather self explanatory though i had more problems with it than with putting the pictures in the potion to develop all hanging the pictures involved was using a pair of forceps to gently slide the photographs out of their trays lifting them up to drip for a few seconds taking them over to available spots on the string and attaching clothespins to them no matter how hard i tried i could not master the forceps i dropped a few pictures i tore another the rest of them took me so long to hang that i hardly helped ian at all with that part of the process why cantwe just use magic to get those out of the trays i asked still frustrated even though we were finished ian shrugged you could i guess sometimes it just easier to do things the muggle way i snorted and ian laughed dontworry about it i didntlike the picture you ripped in half anyway you did you said so when i put the picture in the tray yes ian admitted but that doesntmake you feel better i smiled now you re crossing into dan sense of humor how is that different from percy s it not really dan is just a bit kinder ian nodded slowly and coughed again as he had when he d mentioned dan right after i d come downstairs i sorry i said quickly for what i didntmean to make you uncomfortable i i know it an uncomfortable topic ian shook his head i hardly knew dan laura i thought the subject was making i you i uncomfortable i no i just the subject caught me a little off guard last time and i didn t i mean i didntwant you to think i d forgotten about maybe a little uncomfortable i laughed at myself i just not used to people not beating around the bush when they talk about dan ian awkwardly shifted his weight to one side i ll try to keep that in mind i shook my head no need to i smiled i guess i d better go back upstairs and proofread another section my guess is that at least two sections are sitting on my desk as we speak ugh ian said making a face desk work another reason i dontlike the main workroom yeah the desks arentmuch i agreed walking to the door but the chairs are great i stuck an arm out of the now cracked door nox as i reached the staircase the lights went out again and i heard ian call my name i turned and saw his silhouette standing outside of the darkroom what i called there a photography position opening soon simpson retiring you should think about it he said loudly not moving from his spot outside of the door i dontknow anything about taking pictures so learn ian raised his wand the lights started to flicker back on nox i didntthink about what he d said until i got back to my flat one night about a week later joan had sent another letter with news about herself and our friends it seemed as if all of them were moving forward she was doing well in the summer classes she was taking and loved volunteering at st mungo s adam had just gotten a role in a production of the merchant of venice even cedar the most indecisive and noncommittal of all of us had learned she liked working with money and had gotten a permanent position at gringotts i felt like the only one floundering yes i had a job but not a career i wanted to be able to say that i did something at the prophet not that i merely worked there i thought about what ian had said about considering photography at the time it seemed like a great alternative to the crap i was doing in the main office on a whim i went to my parents house to borrow my dad old camera after fiddling with it for an hour he remembered enough to show me how to focus it and adjust flash levels and film speeds i had no idea what i was really supposed to do but i wasntabove experimentation within a week i had a few rolls of pictures i d taken at the park near my flat and at a busy street in london the pictures were sitting in my bottom desk drawer waiting for the chance to be shown to ian finally a few days after i d brought in the prints to the office ian sent a note asking for help developing his film that afternoon well the good news is that you re not hopeless he said after looking through the prints quickly i d dragged him into the hallway after we d finished putting his pictures into the developing potion you re figuring out the focus which is probably the hardest part here what you need to remember in magical photography the subject of the photograph will move we charm it to do so the background however stays the same so it the background you want to get perfect oh i said somewhat dejectedly ok i ll try again do that ian said smiling but now let hang up some pictures i did much better with the forceps not tearing a single photo i had several rolls of pictures by the time he called me back down a week later he recommended that i keep paying attention to backgrounds but said that i was on the right track if i got a job as a photographer what would i be taking pictures of i asked ian shrugged whatever your beat is i take pictures of sporting events as well as news events that take place in diagon alley not much happens in diagon alley so mainly i do sporting events that seems like a random assignment not really i travel a lot for the sports pictures so i need my other beat to be close to the darkroom my guess is that whoever gets the new position will get a rather boring beat hogsmeade and hogwarts maybe those places to need their own photographer no but people like to read about their kids and see their pictures in the paper ian said he took out his wand nox the lights popped out back to work my meetings with ian became regular once a week i d go down to the darkroom and show him photos once a week he d tell me i was making progress and to keep trying i no longer had to concentrate as much while putting pictures into trays of potion or while hanging up the photos to dry while we worked ian gave me tips about how to improve my photographs and explained some of the subtleties of using a camera my weeks revolved around those meetings which got longer as he started showing me how to do tasks that were more complicated i genuinely enjoyed learning about photography and i liked ian company i was rather lonely at the time i guess i felt as if i had two friends joan whom i never saw and ian whom i saw once a week sure i was friendly with some people in the office i ate lunch with elliot the man who d taught me about the network and a few women from the local and national news sections of the paper though i enjoyed being around them i didntfeel as if those were real friendships not like those friendships i d had with the other seventh years with percy with oliver i missed them both despite the boring nature of my workdays that didntinvolve trips down to the dark room christmas and new year came much faster than they d ever seemed to come before are you coming to the office new year party elliot asked me during one of our group lunches there is one i asked i had wondered but thought someone would have mentioned it sooner than a few days before the event oh yes it quite a good time and cuffe kind of expects everyone to come hilary one of the women from the national section said you should definitely come i grinned joan had been on my case for the past month about going to the wood party she d assured me oliver did not mind if i came though i couldnthelp but wonder if she d even brought up the possibility in her letters to him for the past week i d been desperately searching for a better excuse than i dontwant to go the office new year party would was a better excuse than i ever could have hoped for i ll definitely be there i said nodding good elliot said the party went well and i met several colleagues i d never seen in the main office space before including some of the photographers i had a good time still i couldntsilence the small part of me that wondered what would be happening if i d gone to oliver house but it was only a small part i d gotten short breaks from work for christmas and new year s when i went back i was sure that every additional day i spent with the network was a day that i wouldntspend with my grandchildren the work was so boring i thought it was impossible that the tediousness wasntcutting time off the end of my life i started to put all of my effort into photography spending lunch breaks in the dark room to develop my own pictures and to practice charms on them i enjoyed experimenting with the different charms ian had shown me different charms made people do different things some charms the charms most commonly used on the photographs that normal wizards take and have developed by a professional made people do whatever they were doing when the picture was taken ian called these the candid charms other charms made people act in certain ways no matter how those people had felt when their photograph was taken i could make sad people smile and wave i could make happy people angry about five months after i started working with ian and about two weeks after i d learned how to charm pictures i finally asked him what had been bothering me since he d told me about the different types of charms arentwe doctoring these photos i asked ian a muggleborn was familiar with the term and shrugged technically i guess isntthat dishonest ian laughed if by dishonest you mean that the photograph isntrepresenting what was actually happening at the very instant the picture was taken then yes however here here an example ian took down a photograph of a quidditch seeker reaching out to catch the snitch this woman missed the snitch by inches ian said he performed one of the candid charms to show this happening now you cantreally see this person reaction however i can assure you that she almost broke her broom in half while still riding it she was so angry he performed a charm that increased a subject anger the person in the picture started making signs of frustration after continuously missing the snitch not exactly her reaction but it does represent her feelings is that dishonest he asked i paused kind of but not horribly exactly it no different from touching up a photo to increase the quality not really it simply makes a better product ian said i guess i agreed some of the photographers here do perform charms to inaccurately portray their subjects ian said lowering his voice a little even though there was never anyone else in the dark room with us at least i about ninety nine percent sure that they do i cantprove it of course what they do yes is dishonest and i strongly suggest you never do it he rarely got preachy on me that was one of the only times he ever did i solemnly promised him that i never would publish an inaccurate or truly dishonest photograph he smiled nodded once and turned back to his work i started hanging pictures in silence while ian continued to charm a few more pictures it was uncommon that we worked without talking usually about photography but sometimes about other things never highly personal things perhaps with the exception of our shared experiences as muggleborns i tried to avoid personal subjects partially because he was a coworker and i d always been told not to get too close to people i worked with also ian was a bit nosy at the time i was still a little worried he d try to get involved if i told him too much like joan had done in the past would you like to be a photographer for the daily prophet ian asked suddenly yes i said immediately dropping the picture i d been hanging to dry i talked to cuffe this morning told him you already know how to do the lab work and are getting rather good at taking pictures too and considering that i taught you everything myself i was able to assure him he would save time and money hiring you because you know how things here are done it was true charming photographs had been his last lesson for me i d already learned now to make the dangerous developing potions i d even learned how to resize and place photographs onto the broadsheets so that they could be published the job yours ian said looking up from the photograph he d finished charming i didnteven bother to pick up the dropped photograph oh thank you ian i said beaming and practically jumping up and down thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you ian laughed and bent over to pick up the picture still lying on the ground after he stood back up i threw my arms around him and hugged him tightly thank you i said one last time and kissed him friendlily on the cheek ian laughed again a bit embarrassedly you re welcome i ll just have to leave that part out when i tell my girlfriend you accepted the job you have a girlfriend i asked surprised but not unhappy yes i ve told her a lot about you actually she particularly liked the story about when you threw yourself under this table he motioned to the center table which we were standing next to when you thought your developing potion was going to blow up oh i did not i said waving a hand dismissively you did ian said smirking why didntyou ever tell me you had a girlfriend i asked to change the subject you never asked i never asked well why didntit ever come up well if i would have mentioned sarah then you d have asked about her then i would have had to ask you if you had a boyfriend which would have led to oliver wood and you never seemed so keen to talk about him i dontseem not so keen to talk about oliver i said after blowing air out of my nose i blinked and looked at him more closely in the poor light wait ian was trying to hide a smile so large that it was clear he was only barely keeping himself from laughing i the quidditch photographer laura ian said as if in explanation for knowing information about me that i d never told him so he asked about you when i took his picture at the beginning of last summer i kind of suspected he d dated you based on how he asked and your reaction to that one article confirmed my suspicions he laughed at my still befuddled face i simply put two and two together after several seconds i said i think everyone else is better at math than i am maybe if i werentstill so happy about not being the prophet tool anymore i d probably be rather pissed right now i know that why i decided to confess now ian said grinning i shook my head and smiled despite my best efforts not to your sense of humor is definitely more like percy than dan s ouch ian said wincing in mock pain i d complained to him once or twice about percy lack of communication anything else you d like to confess while i in a good mood ian paused but shook his head no you should go upstairs and tell cuffe you ve accepted the new job ok i said in my excitement i almost forgot to nox the lights in the hallway before leaving the dark room which ian probably would have killed me for even if that would have meant someone would have had to train a new photographer i was able to see mr cuffe right away which was unusual if one didntmake an appointment come to accept the job cuffe asked from behind his clean desk before i d even reached the chair across from him i nodded and stopped walking here the contract he pushed a piece of parchment across the desk take it home tonight read it sign it bring it back tomorrow ok you ll start next week you can spend the rest of this week familiarizing yourself with your beats hogwarts and hogsmeade i guessed hogsmeade yes you wontget hogwarts until after the triwizard tournament is over rita skeeter has that story and she has her own photographer bozo so until you get hogwarts back you ll take over one of simpson assignments which is i asked praying it would be a decent beat london just the general stories we ll send out more experienced photographers for bigger stories and diagon alley is ian s yes sir i think the assignment will be good for you you re from london correct the editor asked though it was clear he already knew the answer yes sir then i sure you ll do fine cuffe smiled not kindly but still supportively the kind of smile that oliver used to give his players before a match i thought the thought made me uncomfortable the past few months had been good for me where oliver was concerned i had had other things to think about like learning about photography the better i d gotten at photography though i still was by no means great the less angry i was at oliver for succeeding at his job i was still angry with him for giving up on the relationship of course i missed having him to talk to and as far as i was concerned it was his fault i d lost him as a confidant thank you i ll do my best i promised cuffe i ve no doubts of that now go unpack your desk for the next unfortunate person to receive your job yes sir i said with enthusiasm turning to leave dontforget the contract i spun around quickly picked it up and headed out of the office that night i got out a quill and parchment and sat at the small table in my kitchen dining room living room to write my first letter to joan that wasnta response to one of her letters joan they finally offered me the job i accepted of course tell oliver love laura author note sorry for the long wait for this chapter school got in the way of writing fan fiction unfortunately thank merlin for vacations be on the lookout for more updates at least one between now and the end of january in the next chapter which was originally going to be part of this chapter oops about six months after the end of this chapter laura career makes her first reunion with the seventh years quite uncomfortable shouldntbe an extremely long chapter though i ve said that before chapter 16 binding that a nice picture of the castle ian said looking over my shoulder at a picture of hogwarts i was hanging to dry most photographers at the daily prophet preferred to develop their pictures alone to prevent their colleagues from seeing the bad photographs they d taken that week the bad pictures were inevitable news is hard to capture in a film clip imagine trying to capture a story in one frame of that clip even if the subjects in the frame can move yet even though all of us photographers knew that all of us took bad pictures most of the people at the prophet tried to hide it it was a pride thing i could understand that but ian and i had no reason to hide our pictures from one another he d seen my first pictures i d helped him develop enough rolls of film to see some of his not so great shots truth is we d gotten used to each other company and preferred to have someone to talk to in the dark room it helped keep the rather monotonous task of developing film from getting boring i looked forward to seeing ian which i only got to do while i developed my pictures each week thanks my first picture for my hogwarts beat it ll look great next to the catching headline school closes for summer i said sarcastically ian laughed good naturedly that an important story happens every year as if anyone needs the reminder i highly doubt the professors or students are going to care to read about the end of term in our paper not every story has to be earth shattering yeah well you have to say that you cover sports ouch ian said but he laughed he was more than used to my abuses of the sports section which i hardly ever really meant that coming from the hogsmeade photographer turned wedding photographer oh shut up i said seriously turning away from my string of drying photographs to give ian a dirty look it did no good his back was turned and he was shuffling through photos to find the ones worthy of charms anyway i added turning back to my work i still have the london beat cuffe letting me keep it over the summer so he ll be paying me for something too bad there a lot of money in wedding photo ow oh i didnthit you that hard i said moving my hand away from the back of his head anything interesting happening at hogwarts ian asked catching the hint that a change of subject was in his best interest you mean other than a student dying ian paused oh yeah oh yeah i mimicked guess that all i should expect when his death was hardly a footnote in the paper well other things kind of overshadowed the story ian said slowly knowing i wasntgoing to like his comment even if it was true i not saying it should have been the front page headline i saying his death should have had a headline yes ian agreed he paused even longer than he just had know him no i said i stopped hanging pictures knew who he was of course didntknow him personally i knew i d sounded relieved i was glad i hadntknown cedric diggory personally i d gone to the school on the last day of term to take pictures of the students leaving the castle to get into the thestral drawn carriages it was obvious that the school was reeling from the loss i pitied those who had known cedric i knew how they felt how they would feel for a long time i wouldnthave willingly taken any of their places i see ian said i knew what that meant it meant that he knew there was more than i was saying he knew i was glad that i hadntknown cedric and he knew why i was glad a few months previously i d asked him why he never talked about the weasleys despite knowing bill fairly well when they were younger at first he d tried to get me to believe that he didntwant to bring up percy which made no sense i complained about percy lack of communication periodically it had gotten to be routine i complained about it more for the sake of complaining than because i was actually still angry with percy for burying himself in work that just the way percy was no reason to take it personally do you remember how i said i didntremember you from hogwarts ian had asked avoiding my gaze yes that was true but i do remember you being at that funeral dan funeral i had winced slightly not my best moment ian still didntlook me in the eyes but he said i remember thinking you were taking it very bravely a gryffindor could say nothing kinder to another gryffindor i never told ian anything else about dan and me ian never asked but i think he suspected a lot that brief conversation made us better friends we d clearly established what our conversations could not cover which opened up a world of subjects that we could discuss i absently gazed at a picture that i d taken of hogwarts at dusk debating whether or not to say what was on my mind dan didntget an article either i know ian said we worked in silence except for ian charms for a few minutes i quickly worked myself out of the sadness i felt after thinking about how the people who were missing cedric were feeling i thinking of moving to hogsmeade i said it ll cut down on travel plus i wonthave to be in london very often when i lose the london beat would moving really be worth not having to apparate to hogsmeade every day ian asked no but it would be worth being there if anything happens that is important ian laughed quickly in hogsmeade how likely is that i shrugged all of my photos were now drying i turned around so i could lean up against the center table and face ian back depends on whether or not dumbledore telling the truth ian turned his head to the side you believe it he was clearly surprised i dontknow while the kids were leaving the castle i heard people talking about the speech professor dumbledore gave dumbledore definitely believes he back doesntmean it true ian said no i shivered slightly even though the developing potion brewing in the corner made the room quite warm i went to hogsmeade library after leaving the school looked at some papers from before you know who died or disappeared maybe another shudder i hope he wrong you know who doesnt seem to be back no i agreed time will tell i guess i guess ian shifted his weight i was glad to see him give a sign of uneasiness ian was a muggleborn like me so even though he would have been old enough neither of us could remember you know who first reign nevertheless i was still highly unnerved by the stories dumbledore was telling and was glad ian seemed to be too i didntwant to feel cowardly you ask elliot to the wedding yet ian asked clearly trying to change the subject and choosing his current favorite topic because it was my least favorite thing to talk about no i said darkly i not going to we haventbeen dating that long a few months and he d just be bored i continued ignoring the interruption i ll be taking pictures most of the time ian laughed i scowled it wasnt my idea i said you still said yes what was i supposed to say no joan i wonttake pictures at tara and adam wedding in fact i dontreally even want to go of course not ian said you have to go see i said they should never have asked you to be the photographer it rude ian said in what could have been interpreted as sympathy if one didntknow better ian and i had been through this conversation before it didntmatter ian found the situation highly amusing i found it displeasing and had to vent frequently about the future situation joan had set me up for truth is i thought being the photographer would help me out i admitted having a job to do means i wonthave to be as social ian snickered are you joking you ll have to be around the bridal party all of the time you ll get to be social with a camera in front of your face i groaned you could try to make it seem as if this wedding wontbe hell for me i sorry look would you like me to come i snorted you just want to witness everything in all of its horridness for yourself no ian said affronted i raised an eyebrow ok partially ian admitted but i could also help maybe make things less awkward you could introduce me as a friend you d have to talk to me which will give you an excuse not to talk to them it not that i dont want to talk to them just under different circumstances i ll gladly come ian offered once more thanks but no thanks i said politely you d be just as bored as elliot would be and i dontthink there a person on earth i could bring to make this less awkward than it going to be it would help if you d seen your friends in the past year i know i said i ve written to all of them at least once late christmas cards all of them ian asked fully knowing the answer he wasntfacing me and i could still see him grinning shut up i muttered almost all of them not oliver ian said unable to control his laughter anymore well it been a year maybe it wontbe so bad i said are you still angry with him a little i admitted maybe a little more than a little ian started laughing even harder oh it going to be bad you still have time to get back in contact with him i could i said nodding you won t ian said finally turning around to face me if i know you you ll put it off as long as possible yes i didnttry to deny his allegation well look at it this way it will be over in september lovely a whole three months of dreading the wedding ian smirked on the plus side you ve plenty of time to find a dress you really are an ass i said arentall of your friends ian asked smugly i laughed appreciatively now that you mention it yes ian went back to his pictures which were lying on one of the tables that line the walls of the dark room wonder what that says about you ow he spun around on his heel clutching the back of his head i know exactly what it says about you i grinned yes he grasped for words for several seconds before giving up you re lucky i too nice to call you any of the words that just came to mind i nodded once i sure i am i said with false sincerity sure you dontwant me to come to that wedding ian asked preemptively putting his arms up in defense get back to your work i said laughing i spent all summer dreading the beginning of school i was reasonably sure i was the only person who wasnta student or a professor who felt so negatively about september first yes the beginning of the school year meant that i would actually have something to take pictures of at hogwarts other than the practically empty castle despite its lack of activity i was required to go to the school for a certain amount of time each week i usually had tea with hagrid we avoided serious or even half serious topics small talk was about all we could manage because of his negative feelings towards the prophet after i d convinced him that half of the people at the paper hated rita skeeter he became more welcoming and i enjoyed his cheerful company conversely the beginning of september also meant that i would lose my london beat which i rather liked because it frequently got my pictures in the daily prophet and even the sunday prophet and of course the beginning of the term meant that the ominous wedding would be less than one month away since i was dreading the beginning of that month so much september quickly came the only good to come of the month was that i was able to move out of my small flat in london to a small house in hogsmeade the house was not a lot bigger than the flat in london but the kitchen and the living room were separated by a wall which i was thankful for on the day of the wedding i spent all morning preparing for the mid afternoon ceremony three months of misgivings about the wedding had hardly motivated me to prepare for it i scrambled around my house gathering the equipment and film i would need i wasntleft with much time to get ready myself i skipped lunch in order to do something with my hair before apparating to tara aunt estate where the wedding and reception were taking place i had to apparate twice to get all of my stuff there people working at the main and quite large house directed me to the back i levitated my gear and walked around the side of the house a lovely backyard if an area so large can be called something so quaint came into view the trees were turning colors and falling to the ground the grass was still bright green and well manicured a pond with a guesthouse was on one side of the grounds and a few gardens of varying types were scattered about a vegetable garden was near a tool shed a couple of flower gardens were near the house there was even a small rock garden with a fake waterfall small fountains were placed deftly in rather bare areas despite the variety of things in the yard it did not appear cluttered or distasteful but rather holistic and well thought out the photographer in me immediately began focusing on the locations that would offer the best backgrounds for portraits one of the best was a small light wooded gazebo near the center of the yard that unmistakably was where the ceremony would take place so i headed in that direction the people moving around the space quickly came into focus the wedding was still a few hours away so no guests had arrived several people were working at magically setting up chairs and decorations i took a couple of shots of the scene before coming into the area it wasntuntil i saw the small group of men in tuxedos goofing around that i realized how nervous i was about seeing everyone again i felt a strong urge to turn around and run or to throw up adam saw me first laura he said starting to walk down the aisle towards me and the other three men followed i met them in the middle of the rather long aisle holding the biggest smile i could manage and keeping my attention on adam i clutched my camera to keep my hands from shaking you haventmet my little brother adam said pulling forward a young man i didntrecognize i took the opportunity to look at the whole group mark and oliver were smiling politely mark nodded slightly when i d caught his eye and i nodded back this is evan adam said i shifted my camera over to my left hand so that i could shake evan extended hand nice to meet you and you evan just began at cambridge adam said proudly cambridge i asked impressed it a university adam started i know it a university i interrupted it a very good university well one of us had to get the brains adam said laughing pleasantly and one of us had to get the magic evan grinned unfortunately neither of us got both adam punched him playfully i realized my smile was much less forced than it had been i d missed adam sense of humor and way of making people feel more at ease it appeared as if both he and his brother had gotten those traits i always wanted to go to cambridge when i was young i said honestly directing my comment at adam slightly younger brother it great evan said enough about evan adam said how are you i good i said taking my camera in both hands again you never came to see me in merchant i was spectacular you never wrote and told me when it was playing i said you never wrote and asked there was a brief pause which adam broke with laughter i in a wizarding production of the same play now perhaps you can come to it i did promise to see one show might as well get it over with i joked i looked around the gazebo where are the girls inside getting ready mark said motioning to the main house all right just let me take a few pictures of you all standing around before the wedding and then i ll go say hello ok adam said shrugging carelessly he was by far the least nervous groom i d ever seen the men hardly moved apart from shifting their weight from side to side all of them watched me as i walked a few steps away and focused the camera we stood there for a minute me with the camera to my face ready to take a picture and them facing the camera looking somewhere around my stomach with half smiles on their faces unsure whether they were supposed to be posing or not finally blushing i took the camera down just pretend i not here oh mark said he turned to oliver well that shouldntbe too hard for one us oliver muttered something that made mark laugh but that i couldntmake out i quickly brought the camera back up to my eye again to hide my cheeks which were getting even redder the group stopped looking at me and started having a fake conversation i took a couple of quick pictures thanked them and headed for the house i held out hope that the reunion with the girls wouldntbe as bad once i finally tracked down the room someone told me they were getting ready in i knocked lightly praying one of tara relatives wouldntcome out in a towel or anything equally or more embarrassing yes tara called i er it laura i said loudly i came early to get set up and get a few shots before the ceremony i sighed and leaned my head against the door the door didntsupport my head for long well why didntyou just come in joan asked flinging open the door and dragging me into the room i was less hesitant to look at the whole group of women than men tara was sitting in front of a mirror in a bathrobe while rose put the bride hair up into an intricate weave of braids and curls the process seemed to involve both a lot of magic and a lot of hairspray the two girls smiled and waved into the mirror looking at my reflection cedar had been looking out of a window and over the grounds but now was facing me she smiled kindly and i smiled back over joan shoulder caught in her enthusiastic hug no one had begun to dress yet how are you joan asked letting go and pushing me away so she could take in my whole appearance you look nice i looked down at the purple dress i d gotten for the event it was conservative enough that i wouldnthave to worry about my movements while trying to get good shots thanks i said and i fine tara dress was hanging on a mannequin in the corner of what appeared to be a spare bedroom it was a quite lovely dress with a simple sleeveless cut and a short train the material was so rich looking that a fancier cut would have been over the top oh that quite lovely i said automatically bringing the camera up and focusing on the dress carefully including the window that was lighting the dress in the shot that will turn out well cedar laughed i dontthink i ve ever seen laura take something so seriously well perhaps except she coughed joan tells us you re doing well at the daily prophet well enough i said thankful that cedar had averted whatever had popped into her mind a moment previously stop moving rose scolded tara gaining everyone attention i not moving at all tara said turning her head to look directly at rose rose took her head gently i hope and made tara face the mirror again you are moving you re shaking like a leaf i canthelp it tara said there are going to be so many people the blotts wouldnthave it any other way you ll be fine after i finish you ll look stunning rose said she hardly needs your help for that joan said walking behind the two so tara could see her smiling reassuringly wouldntbe so bad if adam was at all nervous or could understand why someone would be nervous tara said cold feet i mouthed to cedar walking over next to her cedar shook her head no just stage fright she whispered i smiled mind if i take some pictures of you all getting ready a friend told me that those make some of the best wedding pictures go ahead tara said it was so nice of you to volunteer to be the photographer laura it hard choosing people to help that you believe you can trust so adam and i were quite relieved when joan said you d offered i looked at joan quickly her facial expression didntchange a bit i smiled and looked back at tara quickly my pleasure i started fiddling with the camera and noticed most of them watching this works much better if you just pretend i not here i spent the next hour with the girls and i quickly lost that feeling of apprehension that had been hanging around all day i took my time getting good shots of the girls preparing for the wedding making sure everyone in each shot was dressed while still managing to keep up with the conversation which was relatively normal considering the situation i was reminded of the later part of our seventh year when all of us were in our dormitory together i d belonged then and i felt as if i belonged with them at the time despite being the only person present who was not a member of the bridal party i reluctantly reminded the girls that there wasntmuch more time to take the formal wedding pictures it had been nice spending time only with them i wasntlooking forward to seeing all of the seventh years together yes naturally i had missed them i missed sitting at the gryffindor table eating breakfast i missed the hour long breaks on the evenings while we were taking n e w t s i missed seeing my friends suffering through the same classes i was suffering through those were the people i d been friends with i hardly knew these people but with the girls i could forget that it had been much more difficult to forget while i was with the boys taking the formal pictures didntgo as unpleasantly as i d expected we couldntuse the gazebo for the pictures because guests were already filling the seats set up in front of it however there was a fountain near the house with trees behind it that made a lovely background for the portraits the group followed my directions without question which sped up the process only the pictures with the entire wedding party took any significant amount of time at all whenever i requested that only certain people be in a shot the rest gladly left the frame after we finished i left the cheerful group to finish preparing for the ceremony i walked over to the gazebo to take pictures of the guests whom i d heard chattering the whole time i was in the yard i was used to taking pictures of crowds of people unlike the staged pictures i d just finished so i found it easy to get a few good shots of the people waiting the music that had been playing changed to more traditional wedding music and the groom and groomsmen came out from behind the curtain hanging at the back of the gazebo i still not sure how they got there without anyone noticing the group walked to their assigned places as the crowd whispered excitedly before quieting down as the music grew louder i didntthink much about the sudden appearance of oliver i was concentrating on my job which i knew was about to get much more difficult my goal was to get as many good pictures of the ceremony as possible i took several pictures of the men waiting for the women in the bridal party to appear before my attention had to go back to the aisle it was a lovely ceremony though i couldntlisten closely to what was being said during it i noticed a few differences from normal muggle wedding vows and what the judge from the wizengamot said but i was surprised that the ceremony was only slightly different from the muggle weddings i d been to upon further thought i suppose it not that strange that the highly ritualistic events are almost identical in the wizarding and muggle worlds the two groups are not as separate as they sometimes appear to be at least not among most of the wizarding world which is largely made up of part muggle part wizarding families i noticed a few younger muggles in the crowd who were entranced by the magical parts of the ceremony even evan who surely had seen his witch mother do plenty of magic was obviously impressed by bigger shows of magic than the everyday type he d grown accustomed to it was strange taking pictures while making a conscious effort to stay as unnoticed as possible while taking pictures for the daily prophet i always tried to be unnoticed by the subjects of my photographs but rarely cared whether anyone else noticed that i was taking pictures at the wedding i had to try to be unnoticed by the guests at the ceremony while getting close enough to the bridal party to get decent pictures it was difficult but not impossible and i believe i did rather well the vows were exchanged the couple was presented to the gathering of friends family and acquaintances and adam kissed his bride i hurried to the end of the aisle to take pictures of the pairs of bridesmaids and groomsmen and of course the bride and groom as they walked down the aisle through the crowd by now i d impressed on all of them that i did not want them to look at the camera and they obliged perhaps oliver made a bit more of an effort than the rest the bridal party formed a reception line behind the seating area so that the guests could congratulate adam and tara as they walked from the gazebo to the main house the bridal party stood at the beginning of the line slowing down the guests to give people more time with tara and adam i stood near the couple and took photographs of the guests greeting them the mood was so festive it was wearing away at my unease again and i laughed along with everyone else near enough to hear adam and evan jokes after everyone had moved through the line i quickly offered adam and tara my best wishes before following the crowd up to the main house where they would welcome the bridal party to the reception tara family guided the rest of us into a very large room near the front of the mansion the room had been set up nicely for the event a long table at the front of the room had one row of chairs facing the many circular tables arranged around an open circular area for dancing the crowd was chattering happily and moving to form a circle around the edge of the open area i followed suit keeping my camera ready when we d all gotten into place the circle had neither openings nor places where people stood two deep the adult wizards in the group took out their wands adam a half blood so there were several muggles in the group but i noticed that they were not grouped together i found it somewhat comforting to see no divisions between the two groups i was about to ask someone what was going on but my friends arrived before i could the crowd started cheering and the circle broke to let them through the bridal party walked in arranged into the pairs in which they d walked down the aisle after the vows the four pairs of bridesmaids and groomsmen walked to four points of an invisible square they stood about halfway between the circle of guests and adam and tara who walked to the middle of the circle faced each other and clasped hands the cheering diminished into silence i was mesmerized by this tradition which was so established that a group of a few hundred people could participate without any discussion i hardly remembered that i had a job to do i took a hurried picture of as much of the scene as i could bring into focus before the judge who had presided over the wedding stepped out of the circle the guests moved to fill in his empty spot and walked over to adam and tara who didntacknowledge his presence but continued to look at each other the judge suddenly raised his hands over his head the guests raised their wands i heard the people near me say creounum the crowd did not speak in unison though it was obvious that everyone was performing the same spell even through a camera lens the sight took my breath away and i took as many photographs as i could thin strands of light came out of every wand and orbited the couple and the judge before streaming above them and knotting together the woman on my right placed her hand on top of my camera and pushed down forcing me to remove the camera from my eye i looked over at her angrily you too she whispered and smiled i understood her and smiled back anger completely leaving me to be replaced with warmth i took out my wand and repeated the spell i d watched the others perform creounum my own thread of light shot out of my wand encircled adam and tara and knotted itself with the others strands i could feel a slight pulsing coming from the gathering of light the judge lowered his uplifted hands onto tara and adam still clasped hands two families become one family two groups of people become one community the judge said loudly enough that everyone could hear this is the power of two people coming together you are one the people around the circle flicked their wands cutting the knot from their wands i quickly mimicked their actions the knot of light compressed and imploded into a brilliant flash of multi hued light then the crowd cheered again and adam and tara kissed slow music began playing adam and tara put a hand in each other and their other hands in their proper positions and began dancing now you d best start taking pictures again the woman who d told me to join the spell said kindly oh yes i said following orders i d been caught off guard by the first dance happening so soon in the reception no one else joined in the dancing which didntlast long the guests congratulated the couple through applause and cheers at the end of the song and then began seating themselves around the small tables i rapidly started to feel very lost despite all of the unfamiliar traditions i d seen i hadntfelt overly anxious over them no matter what had happened at the wedding my role had been well defined by the camera in my hands however there was no reason to photograph people sitting for dinner my role now was the same as everyone else s only all of the guests had someone to sit with laura i looked around for the source of the shout joan was looking at me still in the empty area of the room she motioned for me to come to her as she leisurely walked with the bridal party to the main rectangular table i quickly caught up with the slow moving group you ll join us joan asked smiling oh i i assumed i d be sitting with everyone else i said feeling my face flush tara turned her head to see the two of us walking behind her of course not but isntit just the bridal party tara shook her head close friends and family too she motioned towards our destination there a spot for you if you ll have it i i fine with sitting with i stopped talking as i realized how rude i was being it was very kind of her to include me thank you tara smiled and turned her attention back to her husband the photographing going well joan asked oh yes quite well i said good we were reaching the table and joan stopped walking unfortunately i believe we re sitting on opposite sides of the bride and groom enjoy your dinner thank you you too i said i made my way to the opposite end of the table joan was walking towards i was still surprised by tara kindness at letting me sit with the group the two of us never had been extremely close though we never had been at odds with each other either i considered the possibility that i had downplayed how close living together for seven years made two people or perhaps tara would have felt bad for leaving me out of the group even though i hadntbeen a part of the group for very long before we graduated or more likely i decided tara was just a very kind person and she had anticipated that finding a seat likely would have been a very awkward situation for me i d been expecting a seat near the end of the table as i walked past place cards with other people names on them i started doubting that any of my three reckonings were correct though perhaps a combination of the three was true when i finally reached my seat a quick glance at the place cards on either side of me revealed what was likely the real reason i had a seat at the main table joan had helped tara with seating arrangements my spot was right next to the bridal party right next to oliver author note ok the wedding and the wedding reception were supposed to be in one chapter that one chapter ended up being forty pages long so i split it in half the next chapter will be up very shortly preview oliver and laura seated next to each other at tara and adam wedding reception have to choices they can force themselves to have a conversation or they can sit in awkward silence bear in mind that the wedding reception has its own chapter now which choice do you think they ll make author note here the second half of what was going to be i one i chapter about the wedding this is definitely the more important half but the other part was quite necessary to set the scene cantleap right to a reception without having a wedding ceremony after all even if the reception always is the best part of a wedding chapter 16 fair warning up to that point my tactics of merely ignoring oliver as much as possible to avoid as much awkwardness and perhaps conflict had been successful it was clear that i was going to have to take a new approach to the situation probably the more adult approach to take after all i couldntexpect to sit next to oliver through an entire meal without speaking oh shit i muttered to myself resignedly looking back and forth between the two place cards making sure they really did say laura debman and oliver wood they did indeed say just that there was nothing to be done i couldntsit elsewhere without offending my friends i set down my camera on the table pulled out my chair and used every bit of my self control to stop myself from collapsing into the seat defeated i had barely had time to start planning my revenge on joan when movement next to me caught my attention oliver had pulled out his chair but was still standing looking down at me he was obviously caught off guard furthering my beliefs that the whole thing had been joan idea anyone else would have given oliver some warning he managed a small smile before sitting down ian going to hurt himself laughing when i tell him about this i thought even a part of me wanted to laugh at the two of us set up once more by joan and almost as at odds as we had been the first time she d decided oliver and i needed to spend a little time together the part of me that wanted to laugh helped me return a polite smile how are you i asked not looking away from him i all right oliver said and you i good he nodded i glad so work all right oh yes i said smiling a bit more genuinely it not what i ever imagined doing at the prophet i patted the camera sitting next to my plate but it s great good and you i asked your job i mean you enjoy it of course oliver said it quidditch he didntquite meet my eyes i guess i didntneed to ask i said i paused realizing i d probably sounded more hostile than i d meant to i added quickly but you re doing well i ve seen you in the papers a few times yes they re letting me substitute in some real matches now oliver said unable to keep some pride out of his voice but able to look at me directly again granted it only when we re so sure to win i cantdo any real damage it still really good i said i hesitated i glad really or are you just saying that oliver asked i raised my eyebrows i hadntexpected the conversation to go much farther than small talk and niceties of course i hadntexpected to have to carry on a conversation that would last long enough to get beyond what we d just said really i said oh oliver blushed just a little i probably wouldnthave noticed if i hadntseen it so often i sorry i didn t he must have decided saying what he didntdo wouldnthave improved the situation everyone in the room had found a place to sit and food magically appeared on our plates i gratefully turned to the appetizer glad to have an excuse to delay the conversation i turned my head to see who else was near me at the table i recognized adam mother beside me i had seen her and her husband greet their son in the reception line i didntrecognize the people next to them but they were older so i assumed they were some of adam grandparents i ate the appetizer which was some kind of croissant wrapped around some type of meat i didntrecognize though i suspect that if i had known what it was i wouldnthave eaten it oliver started up some small talk with mark and i turned my attention to the adam parents conversation which was rather uninteresting and mainly centered around the wedding that had just occurred but at least i felt no obligation to enter it how percy oliver asked unexpectedly i looked over at him to make sure he was addressing me he was and i frowned why why oliver asked furrowing his brow dontyou read the papers i said no oliver said but what does that have to do with percy he been in the paper periodically for the past year and a half for what oliver asked skeptically murder i said seriously i couldntresist what oliver said raising his voice in surprise you re joking of course i joking i said laughing at him oh oliver half smiled and then gave into a bit of laughter himself so what was he really in the papers for work i said i briefly told him about how percy had judged the triwizard tournament then had been in trouble for not noticing warning signs that there was something wrong with his boss crouch and then had been promoted to assisting the minister of magic he got promoted after getting in trouble oliver asked i shrugged i guess the ministry realized they were being unfair no one noticed the warning signs that crouch was under the imperius curse the biggest warning sign was crouch almost constant absence from work which everyone knew about still not exactly like the ministry to be that forgiving no that what the weasleys told him i looked down at my plate which had the first course on it it occurred to me that percy probably wouldntwant oliver hearing about all of this though it was a bit late to stop the story i bet percy took that well oliver said sarcastically i blew air out of my nose not at all i dontknow exactly what happened all i know is that now the family isntspeaking to him and vice versa oh he picked up his fork to start eating that too bad i wasntsure if he was being sincere or not i decided not to question him on it it been coming for a long time since dan died i think they ve always given him such a hard time he would have stopped talking to any other people years ago he deserved most of oliver trailed off and took a bite of another meat i was unsure about he never really done anything to any of them percy is how he is which is completely unlike the rest of the weasleys they ve never understood that oliver looked over or they ve never been able to help him loosen up either way the family wound up in the same position it not their place to try to change him i said coldly it no one place i picked up my own fork and tried the next dish it was delicious even if it was as unrecognizable to me as the appetizer oliver and i both turned our attention back to our meals i didnteavesdrop on any other conversations because in some strange way i knew i was still in the middle of one i was only vaguely aware that adam parents were talking with the presumed grandparent nearest to them and that mark and adam brother were bantering with each other it struck me that the discussion oliver and i had just had about percy hadntbeen unlike any other conversation about percy that we d had as friends or while dating when we got started on a subject things seemed to go smoothly enough it was when we stopped talking that our relationship reverted to awkwardness after looking back on everything i realized that our relationship always went south when oliver and i couldnt wouldn t probably would be more accurate speak to each other the realization made me want to ask something anything to restart the dialogue but the continuing silence made all topics seem unsuitable finally i resorted to the one thing i knew oliver would willing talk about with anyone at anytime tell me about quidditch i said after finishing the first course and losing my excuse not to speak at all oliver had finished the first course a few minutes previously and had been intently looking at his plate perhaps willing the next course so that the silence would be more acceptable what about it he asked looking over at me i shrugged what you do i guess what it like being on a real team oliver looked straight ahead into space but smiled a bit well we practice a lot there was never time for enough practice at hogwarts with school and all of that at puddlemere when we re not playing matches we re practicing hours a day it doesntget old does it get old taking pictures every day for hours a day oliver asked shifting his gaze back to me yes i said honestly though i dontspend hours a day taking pictures i spend hours a day looking for something worthy of having its picture taken or waiting for the prophet to tell me about some event they re covering oh oliver said but you enjoy it i smiled for some reason i guess it like that professional quidditch is more monotonous than i d expected but i enjoy it so it doesntget old and when you re not practicing i asked we spend a lot of time traveling most of our games are nearby but it still takes time to fly there you fly well we ve all got brooms why not apparate you can bring supplies with you we could but we ve got a fair amount of equipment to bring and plenty of people to apparate with it not everyone that comfortable with apparition anyway flying gives us time to practice formations and to as our captain loves to point out increase team bonding the concept of traveling any other way than by apparition seemed insane to me the daily prophet staff relied on the fast mode of transportation i knew a few people at the paper who apparated between any two places farther apart than a block seems hard to practice formations while carrying equipment oliver grinned the reserve team does most of the carrying equipment the real team does most of the practicing talking about quidditch was making oliver visibly more relaxed i d spent so long being angry with him for placing so much importance on quidditch i d forgotten how much of oliver was quidditch and the matches i asked before the dreaded silence could take over again oliver laughed a little reservedly i mainly help anchor down the bench i smiled at the joke because despite it being true he had been joking and how is that my favorite part he said and the honesty in his voice shocked me he must have noticed do you know what it like to be a part of a team and to watch that team play he asked no neither had i until a year ago it like all of the stress the pressure is gone but you still care just as much about the outcome as the people on the field do you dontwish you were out there playing oliver shrugged sure a little it great fun having fans cheer when i block a goal and when i help the team win but that doesnthappen often i wasntsure what to say to that agreeing obviously would have come across badly disagreeing would have come across as false flattery we both knew that oliver still didntget to play in real matches that often although he did very well when he was given the opportunity to prove himself so i let the comment hang opening up another period of silence tell me about the daily prophet oliver said after a few minutes of the two of us looking around the room pretending as if everything was perfectly normal what about it what you do it rather boring i said partially apologetically partially embarrassedly oliver shrugged tell me anyway well i cover hogsmeade and hogwarts the two most eventless places in great britain at least as far as the prophet is concerned anyway as i said i mainly go looking for things to take pictures of sometimes carol the reporter who covers my beats do you remember carol browning a year older than us slytherin vaguely oliver said anyway carol tells me when she needs a picture of something specific most of the time she can find a picture from the stock to go with her article what do you mean basically i go around taking pictures of specific places and people say something happens at the three broomsticks there are plenty of pictures of the building already taken as well as of the people who work there most of our stories dontinvolve real events so a generic picture of places and people work fine if there is an event it usually preplanned a club meeting or a competition at hogwarts or a convention in hogsmeade for example so i go to those events to take pictures and on the rare occasion that something unplanned happens real news i rush to get there praying there will still be something to take a picture of as i said it rather boring stuff i finished wouldntit be easier to take a picture whenever it needed instead of making a stock probably but then the dark rooms would always have too many people in them only the photographers who cover the big events have to develop pictures every day i guess that makes sense the job keeps you moving then yes i paused then caught myself better to keep talking i get to go back to hogwarts fairly often oliver smiled i jealous i shook my head it different when you dontgo to school there it s it still hogwarts but it strange plus the professors there arentthe daily prophet biggest fans it took me half of the summer to convince hagrid that i had nothing to do with anything rita skeeter published about him er i sighed and shook my head you read the paper while we were at hogwarts because you told me which articles were worth my time do you even get the paper i asked yes oliver said quickly but you dontread it parts of it oliver said getting defensive admittedly for a good reason i was getting rather accusatory sports i said i didnthave to ask he d been the one to tell me if any articles in that section were worth my time yes and the comics oliver said he stalled and i try to do the crossword he knew that wasntgoing to improve his case for not keeping up with current events but it was another section of the paper that he could say he looked at that it i asked no he turned his head away a little i look at the pictures he could still see me out of the corner of his left eye oh the pictures i said mockingly then i understood oh i felt my cheeks starting to get hot and i faced my plate again which mercifully had the second course on it i picked up my fork well you should skim the front page sometimes i do sometimes we both started eating yet again despite skipping lunch i was getting full the lull in the conversation only lasted a minute before i had to break it silence is always awkward but the pause we were entering into was so uncomfortable i could almost physically feel it anyway i said the paper reported that hagrid is a half giant oliver didntsay anything for several moments i not sure if he hadntbeen expecting me to say anything and was busy trying to figure out what i d said or if he had lost track of the conversation we had been having before the digression or maybe he was just finishing chewing before speaking i dontknow i was still looking at my own food so oliver said finally i thought that was rather obvious well the paper exaggerated said being a half giant made him dangerous that s preposterous i know that i interrupted then why did you i didn t i didntknow anything about the article until i read it with everyone else i looked at him so he would know i was telling the truth hagrid knows that now though i still never take his picture it the only way i could think of to make him trust me again oliver didntrespond right away i didnthave to explain why i cared whether or not hagrid trusted me oliver understood how hagrid had helped me he d done the same for oliver for a longer amount of time after all worth it i d say oliver said definitely i sighed at least it easy to keep hagrid out of the shots he always off somewhere working it potter that difficult you canttake pictures of him either harry potter isn t getting the best press i passed up the chance to tell him he d know that if he read the paper potter was in the background of this picture i took for the stock someone printed it the thing is that i didntcharm it when i developed it i didntbother didntthink anyone would want it still i used the prophet supplies so i had to give them the picture someone at the paper took the picture and charmed it to make potter look like the daily prophet thinks he is crazy i lost oliver said after taking a moment to process my ramblings i promised someone i d never charm a picture dishonestly and publish it you didn t the person i promised didntknow that he wouldnttalk to me for a week so now i just not taking that kid picture anymore cuffe he the editor is not going to like that much when he finds out oliver was smiling what i asked nothing it just nice of you to stand up for potter i shook my head i not i just not going to let them doctor my pictures well right now that still in potter favor i guess i said what about dumbledore i ve heard that the paper is being rather harsh on him oliver said neutrally it was a nice change normally when people mentioned how the daily prophet was treating dumbledore and his campaign to let the world know of he who must not be named return they were very opinionated i have to take dumbledore picture and he never tried to stop me i shrugged actually he always polite when i have to see him that dumbledore yes i agreed he not there often anyway he gives the other photographers more of a chance to take his picture at least the type of picture the prophet is interested in you dontbelieve him oliver said simply i thought you didntread the papers i said dodging the question oliver smiled you donthave to read the papers to have heard what dumbledore is saying about you know who no i admitted do you believe him oliver didntanswer for a minute he didntlook away though he wasnt really looking at me i dontthink potter lied he eventually said noncommittally his eyes focusing again why i asked because i ve never heard another explanation for how diggory died i ve only heard the way potter told dumbledore it happened oliver said simply no i haventeither i said slowly and i didntget to know the people on my team well it what stopped me from being as good of a captain as dan or charlie were but potter wouldntlie about something like that period he wouldn t i dontknow why he would i admitted but you still dontbelieve him oliver said well i dontknow why he would lie oliver but what he says doesntmake sense people dontcome back from the dead some argue that you know who not a person i rolled my eyes there a difference between being not being a good person and not being human i agree dumbledore says that you know who never died i didntanswer right away of course i d read all of the reports of dumbledore saying the same thing there was no good response to it i think if you know who were back there would be signs i eventually said oliver nodded i ve thought about that i hope they re both wrong i not saying potter and dumbledore are lying i just hope it not true i said quietly oliver nodded again he managed a thin smile i hope the same thing i smiled back it was true that oliver had never been good at forming relationships with the people on his quidditch team something dan did naturally in that sense dan was a better captain than oliver was i wondered if oliver while leading the gryffindors had used the skill that could make him a great captain he could be comforting and realistic about a negative situation at the same time a slight increase in the chatter in the room at large and movement at the main table caught my attention adam and tara were standing presumably getting ready to walk somewhere what going on i asked cake time oliver said happily they re going to serve the cake i thought oliver simply meant that adam and tara were going to cut the first piece and share it a classic photographic moment though they did do this and i got a couple of damned good pictures of it oliver truly had meant that the couple would serve the guests mark the best man cut the cake and tara and adam delivered the pieces to the guests patiently waiting at their circular tables i sensed that it was an important tradition among the wizards so i dutifully took several pictures i also had an opportunity to pay more attention to who was at the wedding which made me more appreciative of how important tara aunt was in the wizarding world several high ranking officials in the ministry were there although the minister himself was not many guests appeared to be wealthy i saw more people from school like flint and dave whom i d expected to see earlier in the day i even caught sight of oliver parents whom i hadnt expected to see i took that picture from a distance the bridal party and other guests at the main table were served last which i guess was appropriate seeing as they were the hosts it worked out well for me because i could sit and eat cake with everyone else this is marvelous i said after sitting and immediately trying the cake oh i glad you like it adam mother said tara and i worried about how it would turn out you made it naturally the bride and future mother in law always make the wedding cake you re kidding i said of course not she said laughing gives the mother in law a chance to see the bride cooking skills she winked and turned back to the conversation she d been previously engaged in with her husband that is a bizarre tradition i said aloud to myself oliver laughed it is rather odd i guess i ve never thought much about it i going to fail that test i afraid i said going for another bite of the cake i could almost swear that oliver choked a bit on his dessert he covered it well quickly taking a sip of wine to wash down the bite are you getting married he asked trying to sound nonchalant and almost managing not to fail miserably no i said quickly i mean i hope eventually but not i laughed he seemed too embarrassed for me to be embarrassed by his question i not engaged if that what you mean oh oliver said simply he laughed a little too i guess i misunderstood i guess i said still grinning oliver took another bite of cake so i did the same dating anyone he asked after swallowing with the aid of another sip of wine i swallowed the bite of cake i d just taken yes you are he asked surprised yes i said a bit defensively i sorry he said quickly i just joan didntsay i mean i grinned you mean she kept you up to date on what i up to oliver smiled back i see i not the only one getting updates no i said are you dating anyone no oliver said i mean i not dating any one person oh i see i said laughing he laughed too that not what i meant i just mean i not dating anyone seriously i know that what you meant i giving you a hard time he nodded acknowledging that he knew that too but you are dating one person i mean he asked i nodded do i know him he asked going for another sip of wine i decided wine wasntthe worst idea um you might he raised his eyebrows surprised elliot murphy i said the sports reporter oliver asked that him he blinked you hate the sports section i laughed that not true you never even read the sports articles i pointed out to you while we were eating breakfast at hogwarts oliver said i skimmed them anyway i might not care much about the topic but i like the people in the sports section do you know ian mallory yes oliver said a bit hesitantly he one of my good friends got me into photography he a good photographer oliver said nice guy too i laughed nice enough i guess you d like him he a lot like percy i thought you said i d like him oliver interrupted i cocked my head and lowered my eyebrows in a mild reprimand he like percy without the reasons you dontlike percy fair enough i almost agreed to bring him i kind of wish i had now i said why not bring elliot oh well i didntwant to have to leave him all of the time to take pictures it wouldnthave been very much fun for him he agreed not to come anyway oliver asked i frowned at him no oliver looked confused for a moment and then smiled a bit you didnttell him about the wedding no i said defensively in order to save him from the boredom and myself from the awkwardness but i wouldntadmit that to oliver did you bring anyone i asked no as you said it wouldnthave been much fun for anyone while i did groomsman stuff oliver said you understand then i took a big bite of the cake but i didnthave a steady girlfriend to ask oliver said i took my time chewing before swallowing and replying no you don t i d made my point we ate the rest of our cake quickly compared to everyone else the cake was rich and the others were engaged in conversations which slowed them all down for the first time the silence wasntawkward which i was thankful for even if the alternative to awkwardness was mild hostility elliot is a nice guy oliver said after we d both spent a few minutes sipping wine because we didnthave any wedding cake left i looked over at him it had been as much of an apology as i was going to get he is and he a puddlemere fan it was as much of an apology as i was going to give oliver smiled some soft music started playing i looked around for the source but could find none it an orchestra in the other room the sound is coming in here magically oliver said oh what did you think about the binding ceremony he asked after a few moments the binding ceremony what happened right after we all came in here oliver gestured towards the whole room you ve never seen a binding before right oh no i haven t it was amazing i smiled and for some reason started blushing i laughed to try to rid myself of the sudden embarrassment where did it come from it the traditional wizard wedding ceremony oliver said well part of it most weddings now are mostly like the muggles weddings pureblooded families still have purely wizard weddings the binding ceremony the only part worth keeping really it the important part does it really do anything i asked i mean really bind the bride and groom oliver squinted thinking kind of really the spell is more for the guests performing the spell brings people closer together with people they dontknow well the whole two groups of people become one community thing i asked yes exactly it makes people feel more like a community but it does nothing for the couple it a magical contract it the only way to make the ministry acknowledge the marriage that why the guests perform the spell a muggle would be unable to this way the ministry can acknowledge marriages between a muggle and a wizard or witch that makes a lot of sense i said rather surprised that something at the ministry was that simple yet logical yes oliver said laughing at my amazement he continued to explain where some of the differences between muggle and magical weddings came from such as the first dance happening right after the binding as we talked some of the guests started walking into the empty area of the room to dance at first they were just a few kids messing around then adults started joining in older couples first then younger couples still there werentenough dancers to really catch many people attention by then most people were more concerned about their wine than anything else would you like to dance oliver asked as we watched the people on the floor after i d exhausted oliver knowledge of wizard weddings i looked over at him quickly me i asked stupidly oliver laughed no mark he said mark turned away from his conversation with evan adam and the girls yeah mate nothing never mind oliver said turning to him then why d you say my name mark muttered turning his back on us oliver faced me again he didntsay anything for a minute and i rather hoped he d just forget he d asked what do you say damn i dontthink that a good idea why not for old time sake he said still holding his smile that why i muttered going for the wine glass again the glass never emptied which i didntnotice until that moment i dontmean anything by it laura oliver said seriously that hurt more than i d thought it would have just that neither of us brought a guest he continued he d lost his smile i know what you mean and i know neither of us brought a guest i said i just dontwant to dance he nodded once that fair enough thank you for asking though i said my forced and automatic politeness made me want to laugh at myself or maybe i wanted to cry i wasntsure then and i not sure now he nodded once more forget i asked i sorry i said bringing a hand up to place on his forearm but i changed my mind halfway and put my hand on my camera instead i should really get back to my job i said picking up the camera and placing the strap around my neck yeah i understand oliver said one more nod i ll see you later yes i said standing i moved out of my chair and walked around the table and among the dancers more and more people were joining in the festivities which i was thankful for it meant that i really should be with them photographing you did the right thing i told myself over and over i knew dancing with oliver wouldnthave turned out well it had nothing to do with elliot if he would have found out i d danced with a friend even an ex boyfriend it wouldnthave bothered him of course elliot never would have found out i didntwant to dance with oliver because i knew that dancing with him wouldnthave turned out well it hadntturned out well after i d danced with him the first time the activity on the dance floor distracted me enough to concentrate on what i came to the wedding to do photograph the event for adam and tara soon the newlyweds joined the dancing which encouraged more guests to join i forgot about everything except capturing the fun on film after an hour it was obvious that i wasntgetting anything different it was going to take me hours to develop all of the film from the wedding and i already knew that i was going to get tired of looking at and charming the pictures of people in strange mid dance step poses i stood off to the side of the dance floor to look for something worthy of having its picture taken it was only a matter of time probably a short amount of time before the endless amounts of wine would start resulting in interesting events as i surveyed the crowd i noticed oliver and joan dancing i watched for a minute she noticed me and waved and i waved back before turning my attention back to scoping for something photographic good evening i looked to my left quickly mr wood was standing beside me watching the dancing too d j vu struck rather hard and unpleasantly as i remembered the last time mr wood had come up beside me while i watched a group of people dancing i couldntprevent a small groan good evening i said quickly afterwards hoping mr wood didntnotice my displeasure at seeing him he didntlook over so i looked back to the crowd lovely wedding he said simply yes i agreed wishing he would go ahead and say what he wanted to say he didntmake me wait long i tried to warn you what i asked confusedly turning my head quickly he still watched the dance floor to leave him alone mr wood said keeping his tone polite i hadntexpected mr wood to say anything pleasant but i was still caught off guard by being trapped in this already disagreeable conversation i grasped for a response and decided to go with the it wasntmy fault approach look no offense but it wasntmy fault that things turned out how they did mr wood stopped watching the dancers and finally looked at me which was at least a little better it made me uncomfortable when people refused to make eye contact you didntsee it coming no i said bluntly i didnt see oliver breaking up with me for an illogical reason i thought you did of course the relationship obviously wasntgoing to last forever the end of your schooling was the most predictable time for one of you to break it off still a very calm voice it made me wonder where oliver got his tendency to shout when he was angry i felt my temper rising quickly what do you mean it obviously wasntgoing to last forever i know my son i did too mr wood regarded me for several seconds obviously not well enough obviously i snapped did you talk him into it into breaking up with me unexpectedly mr wood eyebrows shot up in surprise no he shook his head he hadnttold me yet that he d made puddlemere i asked no that he was dating you i thought about that for a few seconds but it still wasntmaking sense what do you mean he hadnttold you what i said he tells you everything i countered suspiciously he did but not that mr wood said he narrowed his eyes a bit he never told you he hadnttold me no i said my anger directing itself at another target i scanned the crowd again oliver was still dancing with joan his back to the two of us which was lucky for him but he told you after we d broken up yes mr wood said he knew that what you d want to hear i spat my anger getting the best of me probably mr wood admitted nonchalantly i sure you assured him that he d made the right choice he did make the right choice for both of you you re both doing well i shook my head he d struck a nerve when he d told me oliver had kept the relationship a secret from his father the one person he told everything suddenly the anger i d felt when oliver had broken up with me which had almost disappeared over the course of the year and definitely during dinner was back but when oliver had broken up with me i hadntquestioned the relationship at all only oliver intelligence now doubts about why he would have kept the relationship a secret leapt into my mind i just wanted you to know that i tried to help you both mr wood said with that same infuriatingly calm voice i blew air out of my nose thanks i said before walking away it was rude but not undeserved and i had to get away i walked out of the room and into the entryway of the large house the entryway ceiling was three floors up and had a large chandelier hanging from it it was a typical entryway for a typical large house of a typical rich family i let out my anger by continuing to mentally tear apart the room the walls were painted pure white family portraits hung on the walls all of the way up despite the fact that no one could possibly see the ones on the top the front door was made of a very dark wood that looked out of place in the light colored room i ve never been back to that house but i remember the entryway quite well in fairness i was overly harsh on that room but taking my anger out on the entryway let me walk back into the hall where the wedding reception was taking place and keep doing my job without being unkind to anyone who came across my path which did not include oliver at around eleven o clock a high pitched bell sounded over the music that was playing as the bell became more noticeable the music stopped and other bells all with different high pitches joined the first i walked through the crowd trying to find the source of the ringing but it wasnteasy the guests were excited and were talking more than normal which was saying something considering the amount of alcohol the roomful of people had gone through and the bells didntsound as if they were coming from one area eventually i did discover one of the bells joan was holding a silver bell with a wooded handle over her head and ringing it energetically evan was nearby her and he too had a silver bell what going on i asked the nearest person to me which happened to be a young girl who was probably about ten years old she looked up at me as if i was the village idiot the bride and groom are getting ready to leave for the honeymoon i asked yes she said implying by her tone that it had been a stupid question thank you i said moving farther into the crowd it didnttake long to find adam and tara saying goodbye to the guests huddled around them tara mother was crying a bit but she was smiling i sure i didntas strongly feel what she was feeling but i did understand the tears it was a little sad to see my two friends leaving the room as husband and wife after knowing them as boyfriend and girlfriend for so long they seemed like different people than the gryffindors i d sat in class with perhaps oliver had been more literal about the effects of the binding ceremony than i d thought maybe the binding really did make the guests see the couple as one entity in a community my feelings didntstop me from taking photos and my aching back didntstop me from reveling in the fact that as soon as they left the rest of the guests including me would be free to go adam and tara wouldntcare if they had pictures of the party breaking up i hugged tara and adam hurriedly right before the large group of friends family and acquaintances pushed the couple towards the entryway and out of the front door i instinctively looked for the white stretch limousine that should have been sitting outside of the building waiting for the newlyweds nothing was waiting for adam and tara they moved out from the crowd gave the crowd a wave and disapparated to somewhere in london to catch a portkey to italy it crazy to attempt to apparate that far the company moved back into the house quickly it was a rather chilly september almost november evening the departing of the couple made an immediate impact on the mood of the guests i expected that everyone would be gone by midnight i planned to be back in my small house in hogsmeade within half an hour my equipment was in a small room right off of the main entranceway i went straight there after going back into the building it was going to take me several minutes to put away my camera and the film i still had with me i couldntfind the light switch in the room so i left the door open and moved my gear close to the doorway so that i could see what i was doing i only looked up from my task when a rare usually drunk person would greet me on his or her way past the room feeling some need to praise my skills at staying out of sight or other almost backhanded compliments i was almost ready to leave when oliver stuck his head in the doorway i would have already been gone if i hadntbeen trying to arrange my stuff in some way that would allow me to only apparate home once i d gone through the same process earlier in the day but i was still holding out hope that it was possible to make it in one trip apparition wasntdifficult for me i d had plenty of practice while working for the prophet but it still takes concentration and i was exhausted do you need help oliver asked politely no i said looking even more intently at the equipment which at least showed me that there was no way i was going to get everything home in one trip are you leaving he asked yes he paused is something wrong i looked up no i lied are you sure yes i said impatiently he knew i was lying i could tell that he knew just as easily as he could sense the lie ok he said slowly unconvinced i ll come say goodbye to you all before i leave i said and i winced at my coldness so did he ok he said but he didntleave i just wanted to talk to you about something before you leave go ahead i said he nodded and hesitantly stepped into the room blocking my light i stopped uselessly moving around my stuff and stood up as straight as i could ignoring my back complaints i dontwant to scare you oliver said i lowered my eyebrows and frowned even more than i had been i dontknow what i thought he wanted to talk about but i certainly wasntexpecting him to scare me i was expecting him to piss me off laura if you know who is back you need to be careful i was only more confused yes i agreed so do you he nodded in that way he did when he agreed with my statement but when i had completely missed his point everyone does he said you need to be more careful than most what do you mean you have access to hogwarts he said and harry potter at hogwarts so is dumbledore i said exactly if if you know who wants to get to potter he wontbe able to just walk in you can just walk in are you saying that you know who going to try to use me to get into hogwarts i asked narrowing my eyes at him i saying that it not a bad idea which means he very well might think about it yes oliver said quickly you haventthought about this he noticed sounding a bit surprised no he nodded that what i was worried about when you said you didntthink you know who was back you ve been thinking about this i said that why dumbledore been trying to spread his message as much as possible oliver said so people will think about these things i surprised he hasnttalked to you personally about this he must not think it s he must be extraordinarily busy oliver interrupted like i said i not trying to scare you i just telling you to plan for this in case it does become an issue what am i going to do about it i asked if he comes and tells me to help him and i refuse he ll kill me if he uses the imperius curse i wontbe able to do anything about it i dead or he uses me to get into hogwarts two wonderful choices there oliver shook his head just protect your house you still live in hogsmeade alone yes put up some spells to protect the house the ministry has a list of good ones and can help you with them make it so you or anyone else can only get in through the front door or the fireplace make sure you can always disapparate from the house have people watching for the imperius curse like ian or elliot i nodded ok ok oliver said sounding relieved are you doing these things yes oliver said he smiled my best bet is just to stay out of everything that everyone best bet it easier for you you dontwork for a newspaper i said i know look if you ever need to get away fast apparate to my parents house no one would expect you to go there and there plenty of space to hide if it comes to that i thought about his offer for about two seconds i dontthink your parents would appreciate they would never turn you away if that what you mean i wasntso sure and it must have shown on my face they won t go there then we can help you ok i said tears starting to enter my eyes i forced a laugh to calm myself down you are scaring me a little i sorry oliver said sincerely i just wanted to make sure you had a plan i will i promised thank you oliver he smiled and nodded you re welcome ready to say goodbye to the rest of the group yeah i almost tripped over the equipment lying in front of me which i d completely forgotten about i walked around it as gracefully as i could i saw that oliver said smirking a little saw what i asked ignorantly never mind i smiled saw me almost fall on my face he laughed something like that yes oliver yep he asked why didntyou tell your dad we were dating his smile faltered quite visibly i did while we were dating i specified oh he said does it matter i thought about it for a few seconds i wasntangry anymore i knew that his warning very well could save my life maybe others lives as well the issue of whether or not oliver told his dad about our past relationship seemed pale in comparison to what everyone could be facing if what dumbledore said was true no i admitted i thought he d try to talk me out of it oliver said answering my question anyway would he have he d have tried would it have worked oliver shook his head you should have told him yes oliver admitted i shrugged a little oh well oliver blinked are you serious yes another pause you re not angry not anymore i smiled genuinely at first but it go more and more difficult to hold after all it done it doesntreally matter anymore he looked at me carefully in the light coming from the entryway no one was walking by anymore i shifted a little under the scrutiny no i guess it really doesn t oliver said slowly i d better go say goodbye before i too tired to apparate home oliver followed me into the hall the reception was taking place in already the crowd had significantly decreased in size it was easy to find the rest of the bridal party standing near the main table write to us joan said after i d hugged her and the rest of the girls i do write when i get letters first i said smiling write to me and you ll get a reply i said to the group at large dontforget to come say hello sometime cedar said we work too close for you not to i will we ll plan lunch sometime she nodded and smiled rose and i will come too we re in london mark said shaking my hand come with ian to see a match sometime oliver said you might enjoy it i laughed start reading the paper you might learn something that a fair trade he stepped forward and hugged me be careful i returned the hug but let go quickly i will you too i said goodbye to the group at large walked to the small room and disapparated with half of my stuff directly into my living room oliver warning came to mind and i realized how unsafe it was that anyone could apparate into the house it didntstop me from apparating into the house on the second trip predicting how much i was going to miss doing so once i followed oliver advice which i did the very next day he who must not be named showed himself to people in the ministry of magic including the minister himself at the end of that year the daily prophet retracted its statements about potter and dumbledore admittedly in a very small note in the middle of an issue full of many articles that were more important things started getting bad for the whole nation including the muggles not long afterwards oliver sent a brief note making sure that i d acted upon his warning at the wedding dear oliver i went to the ministry of magic the day after the wedding and put up as many of their recommended defensive spells as i could ian agreed to watch for the imperius curse as did professor dumbledore whom i spoke to not long after you warned me about the danger i might pose to his school under the worst circumstances as he called it he even put some more powerful spells on my house so i should be very safe there professor dumbledore wants me to thank you for looking out for your friends and for his students hope all is well laura it was the fourth or fifth draft of the letter i didntget a response author note we ve crossed the three hundred page mark i dontknow whether to put an exclamation point behind that or not i not sure when the next chapter will be finished but i hard at work on it please stay with me we truly are in the home stretch now next chapter there a chance meeting in diagon alley and that all i going to say because i dontknow where this next chapter is going to end i have a feeling it could end up like this last chapter too long to be one single chapter author note i know it has been quite a while since the last update thank you for your patience and for all of the polite reviews e mails telling me to get my rear in gear this is the first of three completed chapters the other two will be up soon chapter 17 four years later so you re finally giving up the hogwarts beat ian asked me as he gave some of the daily prophet money to the cashier at photographic parchment inc the only photography supply store in diagon alley the photography division of the newspaper had a contract with the store we d do all of our business with them in exchange for modest discounts it worked well for the photographers to have the shop there we could walk down the street to get more film and photography paper whenever we needed it and the owners knew all of us well and were quite helpful i figure it time to pass hogwarts down to the new guy i said examining a camera lens carefully i decided i didntneed it and put it back down in its display next to the counter the new guy been waiting for almost two years ian said laughing as he took the receipt and the chemicals we d purchased for the developing potion from the cashier i grinned and now that harry potter is out of there he can have it you know i never realized how much more exciting hogwarts got after potter got there you know voldemort living in the same body as the d a d a teacher the chamber of secrets opening sirius black breaking into the castle all because of one student in other words now the hogwarts beat is boring again ian asked opening the door for me as we walked out into diagon alley which was back to its pre war levels of traffic extremely boring i agreed laughing i thought the christmas holiday would never come the new photographer can have the beat i happy with london and diagon alley which you stole from me ian joked i hadntstolen any beat from him he d been dying to get rid of the diagon alley beat so that he could completely concentrate on sports mainly quidditch you gave it to me i said maneuvering through the post christmas crowd towards the prophet office anyway the diagon alley beat is too dangerous for a father i said smirking up at him that wasnttrue anymore either really the diagon alley beat had never been more dangerous than any other beat during the war but it gained that reputation at the prophet office because that was the only beat all of us at the paper had to deal with since we all knew the dangers we all exaggerated those dangers while talking to one another ian became a celebrity in the office for having the courage to photograph the damage the death eaters did to any business on the street that did not support them them the ministry had aurors in diagon alley at all times but thankfully the daily prophet had extra protection which saved our office and many lives more than once how is sarah doing i asked more seriously she doing great she misses work but i think she still planning on spending more time at home with brandon ian said smiling proudly as he always did while talking about his family how old is brandon now i said sixteen weeks ian said a bit impatiently because i asked every week born at the end of august remember yes i said i always remembered how old ian son was after he told me i just had difficulties keeping track of how much time was passing time had been going so fast since i was eleven i have to stop by quality quidditch supplies to look into whether or not the owner can get me and my camera a sneak peek at the new broom that nimbus is releasing ian said adjusting his path and hence mine accordingly you can tag along if you d like it wonttake long i shrugged it was either go to the quidditch shop for a few minutes or go back to the dark room and start making development potion that much sooner if i waited for ian he would probably make the potion while i helped by staying out of his way sure i could make the potion but he was better at it after silently debating my options less work won out all right i agreed we were almost at the door of the shop anyway i let ian approach the storeowner alone it was easier to convince people to let one person in on a secret than it was to get them to agree to tell a secret to a group i wandered down an aisle of the shop barely looking the only thing in the whole store that could keep my attention was in the window front i walked over to the display meant to be seen from the opposite direction an array of golden snitches that could be charmed not to fly away from a small area for use in yards without the benefit of the walls of quidditch stadiums sat on stands holding them down the snitches werentprofessional grade but they looked the same i d found snitches to be quite pretty since oliver had shown percy and me a box of gryffindor quidditch supplies that had been about a month before he d tried out for the team there were many people walking by the storefront because of that post christmas surge in shoppers still the top of a little kid head popping into view caught my attention i watched the young boy with dark hair and darker eyes peeking at the snitches after several moments he realized that i was looking at him and his eyes lit up a bit more which i suppose meant that he smiled at me he was too short for his mouth to be in view the kid brought his hand up and waved i laughed and waved back one of the adults walking by stopped behind the boy and looked to see at whom the child was waving i stopped waving but shock prevented me from lowering my arm for several seconds oliver hardly seemed to notice my raised arm he d frozen when he d seen me in the window display too both of us snapped out of our astonishment at about the same time i walked to the door where oliver met me smiling pleasantly what are you doing here oliver asked surprise still very evident in his voice we stepped out of the doorway and into the store so that customers could enter and leave the shop as they pleased i running errands for the prophet i said smiling up at him i was happy to see him i d hardly heard a word from oliver since adam and tara married which had been about four years previously i had sent christmas cards always late but i d never written much to him his responses were always equally short after all we would have had to have written pages in order to get beyond what joan already told us about each either even joan didntwrite as often as she had exchanging a letter with her once a month seemed frequent how are you i asked reaching up to hug him friendlily i good oliver said returning the hug with one arm when i stepped back i noticed why oliver was holding the hand of the little boy from the window surprise washed over me again probably even more than it had right after i d seen oliver the boy who appeared to be three or four years old was smiling up at me rocking a little which was making oliver arm sway slightly too and who how are you i asked the boy smiling back at him it was hard not to smile although not as hard as it should have been good the kid answered still grinning this is bernard oliver said still looking at me my surprise at seeing oliver unexpectedly and my surprise at seeing oliver with a little kid were added to my surprise upon hearing the boy name you named him bernard i asked not hiding my feelings on the name no oliver said immediately making a small face of course not his mother did and you went along with it i asked raising my eyebrows well oliver shrugged and shook his head i didntreally have a choice in the matter no choice in his name oliver didntsay anything for a few seconds at first i thought he was confused but then he smiled a little and said his mum liked bernard who would i be to go against his mother who is his mother celeste oliver said simply as if the name should mean something to me ian had walked over next to me no luck on the broom he said before seeing in whose company i was i hardly noticed his comment who celeste i asked oliver after failing to think of a single person named that my mum bernard chimed in still gazing up at me oh ian said quietly to himself he started to walk away but i grabbed his arm impulsively to keep him there the four of us stood in our small square for several moments i could see the whole group but my focus was on oliver who was looking at ian curiously but with recognition ian was looking down at bernard and bernard was moving his stare from adult to adult trying like the rest of us to figure out what was going on did you marry his mother i asked oliver finally i said it accusingly and meant it that way because i was almost positive that if oliver engagement or wedding announcement had been in the daily prophet i would have noticed it oliver switched his gaze back to me i didntthink anything else could surprise me oliver wide smile did seeing my anger made oliver quickly break into laughter the other three of us watched for several seconds with blank expressions what so funny bernard asked oliver that i said seriously is a good question the group waited for a response oliver calmed down enough to answer bernard whom i had no part in naming is my cousin i blinked your cousin i asked emotionlessly my supply of astonishment running dry oliver nodded still laughing my aunt celeste son the name clicked oliver aunt celeste mr wood younger much younger sister the woman who d trapped oliver and me in a net during the new year game of wizards and warlocks your cousin i repeated thickly ian had more than enough information to understand the joke and he added his laughter to oliver s that only increased oliver response to the situation and it took almost no time for ian and oliver who were building off each other to be in hysterics i dontget it bernard said looking up at oliver his cousin i looked down at bernard the only other person there not laughing i knew i was blushing furiously again bernard seemed to sense that i was looking at him and he returned the gaze waiting for an explanation i smiled at him which quickly turned into a broad grin i brought my hand up to cover my eyes as i started laughing too bernard last comment and expectant stare had made me see the humor in the situation oh it was embarrassing horrifying more like but that what was so funny i dontget it bernard said more loudly not appreciating being ignored i uncovered my eyes oliver had let go of bernard hand when he d started cracking up now oliver messed up the boy hair a bit laura thought you were my son oliver explained he was barely able to stop himself from laughing again i didntthink i could get any redder but i pretty sure i was wrong my cheeks definitely got hotter bernard processed what oliver had said for a minute that funny it bloody hilarious ian said wiping away the water streaming from his eyes but mercifully he did not laugh anymore we had all calmed down quickly though we were still smiling at the joke this is my good friend ian mallory by the way i said emphasizing good more than was needed to get the irony across i know oliver said shaking ian hand though it nice to more formerly meet you and you ian said as the men took their hands back that was a bloody good game you played last month against the cannons that was a great save oliver smile grew even bigger thank you i saw your picture of it in the prophet that was a good picture wasntit ian asked shifting his camera case off his shoulder so that he could stand more comfortably yes it was oliver agreed i had no idea what game save or picture they were talking about i stopped listening to the men conversation about quidditch when bernard pulled lightly on my cloak when i looked down at him he asked is my name bad my eyes widened as a small wave of shame swept over me i bent down so that i didnthave to look down at the little boy no your name isntbad i said smiling as kindly as i could it isn t bernard asked no you have a nice name i lied convincingly i was just upset that oliver didnttell me he had such a nice younger cousin it had nothing to do with your name so you like my name the boy asked smiling i laughed a little bernard is a fine name what your name bernard asked laura debman bernard wrinkled his nose i dontlike that name i laughed appreciatively at bernard comment it made me feel not quite as bad about being so blatant about how i felt about the poor kid name after i d first heard it it not so bad is it i asked playing along bernard thought about it for several seconds no he admitted do you like quidditch oliver cousin said better at continuing small talk at age four than i was at twenty two it ok do you like quidditch i love quidditch bernard said enthusiastically do you what your favorite quidditch team puddlemere he said rocking back and forth a little as many kids do when they re forced to stand in one spot of course oliver said approvingly bending down to take bernard hand again i hadntrealized that oliver and ian had stopped talking to listen to my conversation with bernard i stood up straight again but didntstop looking at the boy what your favorite team bernard asked me i shrugged laughing i dontknow i haventreally thought about it her favorite team is puddlemere too ian said grinning down at bernard really bernard asked excitedly sure how old are you bernard ian asked in his regular voice ian didntbelieve in baby talking younger children even his four month old baby sarah his wife didntuse a babying voice either when she was around ian but i heard her use baby talk more than once while eating dinner at the couple house three bernard answered proudly he almost four oliver told ian and me and what are you doing in diagon alley bernard ian asked getting ice cream bernard said turning towards oliver and jumping up and down a couple of times you dontwant to look around at the quidditch stuff first oliver asked laughing no oliver looked up and over at me well i sure you re busy and if i dontget bernard to that new ice cream parlor within three minutes he might hurt me oliver said while bernard tugged on his arm excitedly it was nice to see you i said wanna come bernard asked the rest of us looked down at him he was still tugging on oliver arm but he was looking up switching his gaze between ian and me i sure ian and laura are busy not really ian interrupted oliver he looked over at me with a look that reminded me a bit too strongly of joan grinning he turned his focus back to bernard at least laura not we have to develop our film i said and it was true we have to make the developing potion first and i can do that alone just as easily as i can do it with you looking over my shoulder ian said that was true too i tried to glare at ian without letting oliver see it but it proved impossible so i probably looked like i was staring blankly at my colleague you can come if you want oliver said ian nodded go get some ice cream and bring me back some fizzing whizbee fruit wham i glanced down at bernard who was looking up at me hopefully all right i said a bit reluctantly yeah let go bernard said moving towards the door and making it very difficult for oliver not to follow i ll see you back at the office ian said giving me a shove making us both follow the woods out of quidditch supplies oliver slowed bernard down long enough for me to join their group i walked up on bernard side and he took my hand before pulling oliver and me in his wake have you been to the new ice cream parlor i asked oliver looking straight ahead to make sure that bernard didntpull me into anything solid not yet is it as good as fortesque s about the same i said dodging a person who wasntwalking in accordance with bernard idea of the flow of traffic the fizzing whizbee fruit wham is good oliver asked and i could hear his smile ian likes it it slightly better than its name which isntthat great careful you might hurt its feelings i looked over at him just long enough to make sure that he was kidding he was but i still felt as if i should apologize i sorry about that whole thing both for insulting bernard and for you know accusing me of having a kid without letting you know oliver asked laughing i guess i said laughing and blushing again my reaction probably would have been about the same oliver admitted do any of the old seventh years have kids i asked so i not caught off guard again as far as i know only adam and tara i would have slapped myself lightly in the head if i hadntbeen afraid of hitting someone in the crowd while bringing up my hand i knew that joan wrote to me as soon as tara would let her their kid is two a little over two now i think oliver said we d reached simons ice cream shoppe and oliver opened the door for bernard and me since i was still holding bernard hand i led the way to the counter bernard and oliver took their time looking at all of the flavors in the shop and after much debate all of us placed our orders and brought our dishes to a small round table tucked in the back of the store since it was december the place wasntvery busy based on the number of packages placed near tables most people in the parlor looked as if they were from out town and they probably hadntbeen to the new store yet bernard sat in the seat that faced the majority of the shop so that he could watch everything going on which positioned oliver and me across from each other bernard seemed more than satisfied with his ice cream and the view so oliver continued our conversation you know that rose and flint eloped no i said when about three weeks ago i guess when did you find out joan wrote a week ago i surprised she didntwrite to you about it yet she was pretty upset that she wasntgoing to get to go to a wedding ceremony i laughed that joan and i guess that rose and flint too yes oliver agreed after swallowing a spoonful of ice cream i saw in the paper that dave and cedar decided to get married oliver nodded took them long enough although i have to admit i thought those two would put it off for another five years they re not very good at making decisions no i said although they stick by their decisions so their marriage should be a long one oliver laughed for better or worse joan never writes to me about these things is she still dating evan oliver looked mildly surprised adam brother yeah they were dating they started dating about a year ago cedar told me one time when i ran into her at gringotts i never heard about that oliver said he shrugged so i have no idea if they re still dating i bet they still are i said are you still dating elliot oliver asked there wasntmuch emotion in his voice so i didntthink much about the question no we broke up years ago why oliver asked if you dontmind me asking he added quickly i shook my head i dontknow we just didnthave all that much in common hell i covered my mouth and glanced over at bernard who didntrespond sorry heck though that not much better he heard worse oliver said dismissively i smiled from you no thank you from his parents oliver said smirking sorry again then what were you going to say before the minor curse word it took me a few seconds to remember i was just going to say that elliot and i didnttalk much ah oliver said nodding that seems to be the death of most of my relationships too are you dating anyone i asked no not right now i ve been really busy since i became puddlemere keeper after the old one was traded to another team that was over a year ago i said oliver laughed to answer the question implied in that comment it been a while since i seriously dated anyone i smiled then caught myself and made my face as unreadable as i could you oliver asked raising his eyebrows i not dating anyone now no too busy oliver asked i shrugged same as always oh i thought maybe oliver took another bite of ice cream i guess i just meant that i assumed you d be spending more time developing pictures since your pictures have been in the paper more and more i smiled glad that he had noticed so i wouldnthave to brag if he asked about how i was doing at the prophet i spend a little more time there but the amount of time i work still evens out some of your pictures have been all over the place oliver said i nodded i wish they could have been pictures of better events i had become the hogwarts photographer at one of the school most news making periods in recent history i was about the only photographer who could get pictures of harry potter on a regular basis and the prophet printed many of them those pictures got me some attention in the office which was nice who doesntlike to receive a little appreciation for doing his or her job well unfortunately it took a tragedy for me to make a name for myself when professor dumbledore was murdered i was the only daily prophet photographer who was allowed to take pictures at the funeral because the event took place at hogwarts so my pictures became the visuals of that funeral for most wizards in great britain a few weeks later i was digging through my stock for recent pictures of dumbledore and i discovered a picture of snape and dumbledore together i had taken it after snape became the new defense against the dark arts professor school hadnteven been in session at the time i took the picture and the paper had decided not to run an article about snape appointment to the new teaching position but it was still the last picture and one of the few pictures taken of the pair the paper printed the picture with a follow up story of dumbledore death and then other publications started using the photograph too for about two days the picture itself became a story and since i had taken that photograph i was dragged into the story too it not your fault that the things you took pictures of happened so there really no reason to feel guilty that the pictures made you famous oliver said simply but seriously they didntmake me famous everyone knew your name for a few days i interrupted just long enough to get me promoted oliver shook his head most people want to be famous he said smiling i wouldntmind it i just would rather be famous for something more pleasant than taking a picture of professor dumbledore and his murderer there no reason to feel guilty oliver repeated i nodded and focused on my ice cream again several people at the daily prophet had told me to enjoy the attention and that there was no reason to feel guilty for what had generated that attention it the nature of news to benefit from misfortune it cold but it true ian had been the only one at the office i d actually talked to about the whole thing everyone else who came up to me knew how i was feeling because they d been there themselves ian who was known for photographing quidditch needed a bit more of an explanation he d been quite supportive after listening to what was bothering me and he had convinced me that there was nothing to feel badly about i wasntfocusing on my ice cream because i felt guilty i focused on my ice cream instead of looking across the table because oliver hadnt needed me to tell him why i had felt guilty or even that i had felt guilty at all the idea that i might be feeling badly about benefiting from the death of a man whom i respected had never occurred to anyone outside of the paper or at least no one outside of the paper had ever said anything to me about it before then all right oliver asked yeah i fine i looked up and smiled and i know there no reason to feel guilty i don t but thank you anyway i done bernard said oliver and i looked over to see a very messy young wizard sitting in front of an empty dish we laughed as bernard smiled at us unconcerned with the dirty state of his face and black cloak scourgify oliver said after taking his wand out of his cloak pocket and pointing it at his cousin the ice cream on bernard disappeared and the boy didnteven blink i gathered that he was used to having the spell performed on him and i briefly wondered what my own mum would have done to have been able to use a spell to clean me up when i d gotten messy when i was bernard age can laura and i finish our ice cream oliver asked bernard nodded but he already was moving around in his seat i ll tell you what oliver offered if you sit quietly for five minutes i ll take you for a ride on the nimbus at home ok bernard said bouncing up and down in his seat but only if you dontlet go of the broom this time oliver said quite seriously and it took a lot of control not to laugh ok bernard promised solemnly five minutes oliver said he took off his watch and placed it in front of bernard when the bigger hand points to this number oliver said pointing to the face of the watch bernard nodded i think i the only one who can get him to do that oliver said looking back at me and jerking his head towards bernard of course i the only one mad enough to take him up on a broom i laughed still watching bernard who was staring intently at the watch how percy oliver asked i shrugged i not sure he hasntwritten in a while i heard about his mum i nodded and looked back to oliver who appeared to be rather sad which didntsurprise me oliver had known mrs weasley when we were just starting school it was easier for him to go to the burrow than it was for me to get there because oliver parents could use magic to bring him is the family doing ok oliver asked politely i shrugged one shoulder yeah now they re doing ok as far as i know but it been more than a year since mrs weasley died i couldntbelieve it when i read about it in the paper oliver said shaking his head as if he still had trouble believing it which i sympathized with i couldnteither i said i thought percy would have although i sure percy was much too upset to think about writing to tell anyone oliver looked at me for a few seconds but he didntsay anything which i was somewhat glad about i could tell he was trying to figure out what i d meant but hadntsaid he was good at it percy ian and my mum could usually do the same thing thankfully they all eventually learned that it was best not to run their guesses by me their guesses were usually correct which pissed me off did you go to the funeral oliver asked eventually yeah figured percy could use a friend since you know things werentso good with the family before mrs weasley passed away are things ok between percy and the weasleys now i thought about it well they re talking again and mr weasley apologized even though he was probably more correct about the whole fight than percy was oliver smirked percy didntapologize he d phrased it as a question just to be polite of course not i grinned back but family is better at forgiving that kind of thing oliver smile barely faltered as he accepted the implied accusation behind what i d said even though i hadntmeant it in anyway against oliver that true i suppose oliver admitted i looked down at my empty ice cream dish i was kind of expecting i mean i thought you would have come i kept my head down but moved my eyes up to see how he took the comment his face didntchange noticeably i thought it would be best to stay away after a bit of consideration i decided maybe you were right i knew you could handle it i raised my eyebrows in disagreement well i tried you tried oliver asked i rubbed my forehead a little to give myself time to figure out how to say what i was thinking i guess holding someone hand just isntenough anymore did you try it i laughed a bit humorously all day of the funeral i mean percy wonttalk about it no will he talk about anything oliver said putting his spoon and crumpled paper napkin into his empty bowl i smirked other than work oliver added quickly no oliver collected bernard ice cream dish and trash in silence i could tell the five minutes was about up because bernard was starting to look excited and was moving around in his seat well if he couldnttalk to you who could he talk to oliver said placing bernard trash on top of his own he held out his hand across the table to take my empty ice cream dish i handed the bowl across the table that what worries me i know it is i laughed silently to myself of course he knew i wish i could still help him but i started five minutes bernard said throwing his hands up in delight and hopping out of his chair he ran around his chair and over to oliver whom he immediately began pulling on five minutes it pointing to where you said oliver smiled apologetically at me before facing his cousin with a more open grin i promised five minutes you did damned oliver darned well oliver corrected himself grinning at me the time suddenly seemed much more important than it had a moment previously and i checked my watch oh wow i stood up and looked around the table for anything i might have put down i d kept my cloak on because i was eating ice cream in december i need to get back to the prophet ian finished the potion by now i sure oliver stood as well oh ok it was nice seeing you i nodded and smiled sincerely you too oliver i looked down at bernard who was still tugging on oliver arm while looking up at me and it was lovely meeting you bernard the boy beamed up at me thank you oliver and i laughed what he means is that it was nice to meet you too oliver said looking down at bernard to make his point yeah bernard said so i ll see you around i said my eyes traveling back to oliver he nodded once i hope so yes is she going to new year s bernard asked oliver looking up at his cousin for the first time since all of us had stood oliver was caught a bit off guard by the question i she can if she wants he turned his gaze back to me you can if you want i hesitated come bernard said letting go of oliver arm to tear around the table to grab my arm he jumped up and down a couple of times it fun come i laughed as oliver walked around the table to try to prevent his cousin from taking my shoulder out of its socket ultimately i couldntsay no to bernard i thought little kids were all right but i was rarely easily persuaded by one but bernard was more likeable than most three and four year olds sure he was a bit of a hassle but he wasnta brat merely for the sake of getting attention or causing trouble and the war was still very much with everyone including me that made bernard simple humor quite appealing so was being reunited with old friends whom i d worried about frequently despite never being good at keeping in touch with them and not attending the daily prophet new year party which was almost exactly the same each year was tempting too all right i said i beamed down at bernard i ll be there yeah bernard said pulling on my arm a bit too harshly as he celebrated we ll see you there then oliver said this time remembering to disconnect bernard hands from the sleeve of my cloak yes i said i ll see you both there i nodded once at the pair of woods before turning uncertainly and walking out of the simons ice cream shoppe alone about damned time ian said when i slipped into the dark room quickly before the lights in the hall could come back on ian was already putting his photographs into trays of developing potion did you bring my ice cream i winced oh shit i lost track of time and then when i realized what time it was i completely forgot about your ice cream i said i ll go back and get some dontbother ian said quickly no one in his right mind wants ice cream in december i was just giving you an excuse to go ian smiled at me and yet again i was a bit reminded of joan so it went well then ian asked watching me move around the center table as he smirked knowingly i nodded i guess it did we had a decent conversation when are you seeing him again ian asked laughing apparently pleased with himself for making me go eat ice cream with oliver i laughed too it wasntthat kind of conversation it was just friendly just friendly yes it was more like a conversation with an old friend than with an ex boyfriend ian nodded sarcastically yes i accuse my old friends of having children out of wedlock all of the time it a great way to oh shut up i interrupted but i laughed at the joke so when are you seeing him again ian asked again turning back to his work new year s ian laughed i ll cover for you at the office party thank you i said but i still only going as an old friend i know ian said in a voice that clearly told me that he didntmean it because bernard asked me i know ian repeated how could you know ian turned smiling genuinely laura he interrupted me just go have a good time with your friends i nodded once in mock defiance maybe i will ian laughed and shook his head at me and try not to be so stubborn i not his almost cruelly skeptical look broke me off i ll try author note thanks to marie for bernard name i asked for a horrible name for a child and she didntdisappoint me my deepest apologies to anyone who has the name likes the name gave a child that name the next two chapters are finished and will be posted very soon preview laura goes to the woods for the first time in five years to bring in a new year the rest of the old seventh years show her how much has changed and what has stayed the same chapter 18 owed apologies the timer on the oven in my parents house went off earlier than i d been expecting i cursed under my breath and threw my heavy winter cloak on over my muggle clothing imagining i smelled smoke i sprinted down the stairs and into the kitchen i neednthave worried mum already had the chocolate chip cookies out of the oven sitting on their baking sheets on the counter i running late i stated the obvious yeah a little mum said taking the cooling racks out of the cupboard for me why didntyou just make these at home it has to be easier to make these by magic it is i said going through drawers looking for a spatula but they taste better when they re made by hand i found the spatula and brought it over to the counter upon which the cookies sat they were a great success last time i went if food tastes so much better when it handmade then why dontyou get an oven i laughed because then i would have to ask for your help if i try to make food here i know you ll help me mum smiled appreciatively you said you were going to see oliver wood she asked nonchalantly yeah i started moving the cookies onto the cooling racks too soon they started falling apart i thought about whether or not cooling the cookies with magic would make them lose their non magical flavor and i decided that it wasntworth taking a chance after going through all of the effort of baking the cookies the boy you dated at hogwarts mum asked failing at sounding uninterested yes i answered even though i knew she knew the answer i d told her when oliver and i had started dating and right after i d come home after graduation i d told her we d broken up is it a date she asked taking another spatula out of a drawer in order to help me move the cookies off the baking sheets i laughed you sound like ian is that a bad thing mum asked grinning she had heard me talk a great deal about work and she liked hearings stories about ian more than any other person at the paper i raised my eyebrows depends what you re or he s saying and in this case in this case you re both wrong it not a date oliver little cousin invited me to go to the party and the kid impossible to say no to so i agreed to go that it ok mum said sounding unconvinced but unwilling to start a conversation that could lead to an argument over the matter are you apparating there i nodded yeah i know where it is and remember enough about the place it ll be fine out of all of the magic my mother knew about apparition was the spell she distrusted the most it probably had something to do with the seeing is believing concept i could make something levitate and my mum could accept it because she saw the whole process when i disapparated mum never saw me arrive somewhere else when i apparated mum never was sure where i came from be careful that always what she said when i told her i was going to apparate somewhere once not long after i d turned seventeen i d apparated upstairs just to make the process seem more graspable for her she d only gotten upset with me for using magic frivolously mum finished moving the cookies off the baking sheets and she started moving dishes over to the sink i started to help her but she shook her head and smiled you re late go finish getting ready i smiled my thanks and went back upstairs to brush my teeth and to grab my camera mum had the cookies on a cheap serving plate with some aluminum foil covering them by the time i got downstairs how d you cool them so fast i asked i put them in the freezer mum said grinning i laughed as i took the plate from her genius practical mum responded laughing along with me have fun at your party thanks mum i pecked her on the cheek and walked out of the room to disapparate so that mum wouldnthave to watch it the front door to the woods large house in scotland was already open when i apparated onto the front steps i hadntbeen thinking about the fact that many other people would be coming in through those doors a middle aged couple had just walked into the small entrance hall and i breathed a sigh of relief that i hadntlanded on them i moved off the steps and to the side of the door while i waited for the pair to exchange civilities with mr wood and oliver whom i could hear speaking to the couple i feared that my sudden nervousness at being back at the woods home might be interpreted as impatience after i heard mr wood move the couple along politely of course i stepped back into view acting as if i d just arrived oliver was just about to shut the door to keep the winter air out of the house he grinned when he noticed me walking up the few steps to the landing my hands gripping two sides of the plate ah miss debman mr wood said seeing me come in it cold outside he was correct about the cold and i followed his directions smiling at him as kindly as i could i hadntseen him for four years but i still did not trust him if anything my distrust had increased since the wedding i was relatively sure that he wouldntsay anything to me in front of oliver but i couldntbe quite sure really i couldntbe sure that mr wood would say anything unpleasant to me at all even if oliver wasntthere oliver shut the door behind me i wasntsure if you d apparate or use floo powder i came from my parents house so i had to apparate i answered shivering a little because of the temperature difference between the entrance hall and the front yard i d been out in the cold just long enough to feel it and do i smell chocolate chip cookies mr wood asked i smiled more sincerely and nodded homemade of course i said my mother did most of the work honestly i pulled back the aluminum foil and offered the plate to oliver dad thank you mr wood said taking one of the smaller cookies off the top of the pile oliver can take those into the kitchen for you you know where the main room is i nodded and let oliver take the plate from my hands to keep my hands from showing any of my anxiety i clasped them together in front of me you can come with me to the kitchen if you d like oliver said starting to lead the way after nodding once to mr wood who returned the gesture with a small smile i began following oliver to the back of the house joan will be happy to see you i told her you might be coming oliver said after we d gotten down the hall from his father the others are here too even rose and flint i asked oliver nodded they re still in that honeymoon phase though it rather unpleasant for the rest of us he said seriously i laughed and the two of us had to step aside for a group of young children who were running down the hallway in the same direction we were going a couple of young women a few years older than us followed in their wake smiling at oliver and me as they passed a lot more younger ones now that our generation getting older oliver noted i didntknow how to respond i d never really thought about the matter before the people i were around most of the time were so submersed in their careers that they werentthinking much about starting families a little scary isntit oliver asked smiling slightly bloody terrifying i said quickly oliver laughed at my immediate response and started walking to the kitchen again it only took a few more seconds to reach the small room with the door that led to the backyard i was surprised at how well i remembered the house everything looked pretty much exactly how it had been when i d visited five years previously my mum been talking about these cookies every new year since you brought these oliver said as he set my mum plate on a table with the rest of the desserts the guests had brought you re lying i said but i smiled anyway oliver laughed ok you caught me i ve been talking about these cookies every new year since you brought these my grin didntfalter though i felt my cheeks get a little warm i ll take you to the other seventh years oliver said moving past me to open the door into the hallway again after we were about halfway to the hall where the party was held i asked do you all get together very often oliver shook his head no just here once a year i hardly see any of them other than at these parties do they see each other often i was walking slightly behind oliver so he had to glance over his shoulder to look at me er tara and joan see each other fairly often because joan baby sits for them and mark and adam see each other sometimes i think after a short pause he added we all ought to make more of an effort i suppose i agreed with him but dontworry about it things go back to normal when we are together oliver said briefly looking over his shoulder at me again well except adam and tara have to look after the kid sometimes and one year joan had to leave because there was an emergency at st mungo s and during the war rose couldntcome one year because she was on duty at the ministry that back to normal i asked sarcastically oliver laughed under his breath now it is we walked into the large room and had to cross the empty space in the middle of room to get to the table where our friends were sitting joan stood to greet me with a hug and the others around the table said hello from their seats i returned their salutations with a wave and a hello of my own i have to get back to the door but i ll join you all as soon as i can oliver said to the group at large save me a seat he added looking at me i smiled and nodded before taking the chair that was nearest to me i glanced around the table quickly i d seen all of the seventh years at least once during the previous four years working in diagon alley made chance run ins more likely as a whole the old seventh years looked slightly older naturally but the older appearances were not only from the physical differences between a person who is seventeen and that person when he or she enters his or her twenties the seventh years presented themselves differently they had a great air of independence they seemed more responsible more mature they were adults about time you decided to show up adam said good naturedly grinning from across the table he had a two year old girl sitting on his knee her head was cocked to one side as she looked at me curiously this is laura claire say hi to laura the girl waved shyly and mouthed hi i said hello back smiling broadly at the little girl with blonde hair like both of her parents she a little shy tara said reaching out and stoking her daughter hair a couple of times to get out a few small snarls she gets that from her father of course said evan leaning past joan to smirk at his brother i correctly decided that it was safe to presume that he was still dating joan based on his presence at the party and his spot at the table not to mention the fact that they were holding hands of course it could have been easy to miss evan and joan holding hands because their actions were being vastly overshadowed by rose and flint who were somehow managing to make it appear as if they were sitting in one chair despite both having a chair of their own rose practically beamed at me which i found rather unnerving that not to say that rose didntsmile much but rarely was her smile so large and open flint smile and gaze were only for his wife while i had to admit that the couple was cute i also immediately agreed with oliver it was rather annoying to see the two people with normally cold personalities so smitten still i congratulated the couple and they thanked me quickly before turning their attention back to each other i was just as happy to focus on other occupants of the table and i gave my best wishes to cedar and dave for their recent engagement the two were happier to turn the congratulations into a conversation which joan and gradually everyone else happily joined i quickly forgot that i had been nervous to be with the whole group again little had changed in how the group got along although the topics of discussion had shifted greatly because we saw each other so infrequently it was easy to talk for an hour about what everyone had been up to at work and at home rose mark and flint were all doing fairly well in the ministry though none had received any spectacular promotions at the time mark enjoyed the competitive environment and rose and flint liked having the same work hours so all three were happy working for the government joan was astonishingly busy working at st mungo s she was the newest midwife to join the staff and the others were happy to give her the least desirable hours and patients who lived in the places that were the hardest to reach evan joked with the group about how they didntget to see each other enough and while that was probably true no one took him seriously both because the couple seemed happy and because he was adam brother adam acting career was going well and the tendency for his play practices and performances to be in the evening made it possible for him to stay at home while tara worked at the flourish and blotts in diagon alley to which she d recently been promoted it was clear that their home life came before their work so i couldntrelate to them as well as i had when we had been fellow students but their dedication to their daughter made me respect them more the two were meant to be parents they werentperfect at it it was fairly clear to all of us that their firstborn was going to be a bit spoiled and maybe a bit na ve like her father however the child was happy and healthy and at two what else really matters oliver joined the group after a little over an hour and dinner was set out within minutes of that but neither changed the conversation much mark and adam liked hearing about life as a professional quidditch player so the discussion still was very centered on our present lives as we girls grew tired of the sports topics we started our own chat about more interesting matters the rumors we d heard about the people with whom we d graduated from hogwarts i told them the basics of what percy had been up to but kept my worries out of it in his career percy was doing very well and that what he d want me to tell others about so i strayed very little from the subject of ministry of magic while speaking about him i sure that rose and flint stayed with the conversation as long as they could but once other guests at the party started finishing dinner and moving onto the dance floor the newlyweds couldntturn down actually having an excuse to be touching each other they hastily excused themselves from the table and moved to the center of the room to flaunt their happiness cedar was quick to force dave to dance with her and evan and joan werentfar behind them i thought that tara and adam were going to stay for a while but claire was rather restless and wanted to play with the other small children so the couple took their daughter to the backyard to which many parents and children had been disappearing and then there were three mark said glancing at all of the empty chairs oliver and i laughed both of us thinking that three was better than two because we knew who the two left at the table would be guess i could try to find someone to dance with so that the two of you can dance without feeling badly for leaving me mark said turning to see if any eligible witches were sitting at the tables behind him oh that all right i said quickly mark gave me a short intent look but he quickly shrugged and smiled ok then i guess it the three of us he said a bit less sarcastically looks that way oliver said mark optimism concerning his company had come too soon silence was about the only thing that the three of us could produce correctly all of us tried to start a pointless discussion or two by making an obvious remark about our surroundings but the only response that an obvious remark can get is agreement or sarcasm neither of which last very long oliver was the first to crack i quite thirsty he said picking up his empty cup i going to get some punch would either of you like some oh sure mark said passing his own glass across the table which oliver took while standing laura oliver asked gazing down are fred and george here i asked yes oliver responded furrowing his brow in confusion then i think i ll pass i said remembering how the punch had faired the last time i d visited the woods but thanks anyway oliver nodded once before walking away to get refreshments i think i might have to go find someone to dance with mark said quietly and i wasntsure if i was supposed to hear him or not i was debating whether i should tell him that i wouldntblame him or not in one sense i wouldntblame him for wanting to leave the awkward conversation at our table but on the other hand i would blame him for possibly making the situation even worse for me i didnthave much time to weigh my options because my thoughts were broken off by a short tug on my sleeve wanna dance i looked over to my right to see bernard small face looking up at me smiling i smiled back do you know how no oliver cousin said undaunted by that tiny problem his smile only got bigger making his dark eyes get smaller i laughed cheerfully he really was a cute little kid and almost impossible to say no to but that hadntspoiled him yet all right i agreed bernard grabbed my hand from where it was resting on the table and i stood up quickly and grabbed my cloak i ll be back soon i told mark he smirked well at least one of us found a dancing partner i smiled back briefly before bernard tugged on my arm i followed the boy through the crowd of dancers he could dodge between people more easily than i could which was leading to me apologizing more than bernard found it necessary to do where are you going i asked after we d gone through the entire room and into a hallway outside bernard said watching where he was going and making his way to the kitchen quite quickly it cold outside i said more out of amusement that as an objection no it not he said simply opening the door leading to the backyard i shut the door behind us why are we going outside i asked grown ups dance inside i almost said i am an adult but that sounded rather childish so instead i silently walked behind bernard into the crowd of younger people there were many more small children outside than there had been when i d been at the party five years previously and once again it struck me that these were likely the children of people i went to hogwarts with there were some people who were hogwarts aged and they had grouped together with some couples dancing on the edge of the crowd to me that whole situation looked as if it would be quite uncomfortable but that where bernard led us what now bernard asked facing me but not letting go of my hand i had no idea clearly we couldntdance how oliver had taught me for one bernard wasnttall enough to comfortably hold my hand or put his hand on my waist and i wasntgoing to dance on my knees secondly i probably couldnthave taught bernard a four year old how to dance even if i d wanted to still i had to figure out something give me your other hand i said holding out my hand that bernard hadntused to drag me into the backyard bernard followed my directions now what er sway sway bernard asked looking up at me doubtfully yeah i said more confidently sway pick up one foot a little he did i picked up my opposite foot now put that foot down and pick up your other foot just a little we both did this at the same time now keep doing that so we did picking up our feet just a little making ourselves sway the teenage girls dancing nearby thought it was cute and made sounds indicating this i looked over long enough to see the boys smiling they knew that it would be a mistake not to show a reaction to a scene their female dancing partners were gushing over some of the younger children also noticed bernard and i dancing and they started mimicking us nearby holding hands and swaying they didntbother breaking into pairs of one boy and one girl it was only a new game after all i heard some laughing from behind me right next to the house a small group of adults was sitting in chairs monitoring the yard which primarily was full of children still too young to go to hogwarts i didntblame the adults for choosing that location bernard hadntlied it wasntcold outside at least not where we were dancing but it wasntroom temperature either bernard and i kept swaying for about five more minutes making common adult child small talk it was somewhat hard for me because i was unsure what young wizards did all day they didnthave televisions after all turns out that they mainly play inside or nearby the house listen to the radio while playing inside the house and have short lessons on reading writing and math with their parents the difficulty of keeping the conversation with bernard interesting kept my attention and i didntnotice when oliver entered the scene may i cut in oliver asked coming up beside us on the side of the younger children he was looking at bernard smiling kindly i doubted that bernard had ever heard the expression cut in before but he seemed to get the general idea of what oliver wanted no bernard said simply and almost politely oliver laughed and said uncle frank is looking for you something about needing help with wizards and warlocks bernard definitely understood this statement he dropped my hands and bolted towards the door that led into the kitchen catching the attention of most of the adults outside all of us watched as bernard struggled a bit with the door before it was opened by a young woman coming to join the group of supervisors well i said i guess i dontcompare with wizards and warlocks who does oliver asked after a short pause i asked does wizards and warlocks take long to set up it takes a little time i checked my watch it not even eleven not that much time oliver admitted mark told me where you went and i just didntwant bernard to bother you oh he wasn t we made a little bit of small talk about bernard but we quickly ran out of material so we looked around the yard pretending that we had purposely stopped talking the adults were gossiping with each other while looking frequently to the young children who were still playing the new game i had inadvertently invented the teenagers were joking with each other in small circles of friends or they were dancing with each other on the outskirts of the group of students what are they doing oliver asked at last looking down at the small children on his left dancing i said simply he looked over at me raising an eyebrow you try to teach a four year old how to dance i said in mock defensiveness oh i ll teach him how to dance oliver said in another six or seven years it a good skill to have i laughed you mean it will help him meet girls it already has he said motioning towards me i nodded that true oliver nodded too but once again the conversation faltered i looked away from him the teenagers were still chatting and dancing some of the children were starting to realize that swaying back and forth really isntmuch fun especially if you cantkeep time with the music the adults laughed at something that must have been particularly funny i haventbeen out here on new year eve in years oliver said partially to himself you never got to see this side of the party did you no i said shaking my head we spent most of our time inside when i came right oliver looked around a bit more i wish you had gotten to see this side of everything i shrugged it much more fun when you re a part of it oliver said incorrectly identifying my shrug as one of indifference i ll take your word for it i said smiling oliver nodded i guess you ll have to guess so oliver face lit up a bit or we could dance now i froze having not expected the offer oliver hurriedly added i did tell bernard that i would cut in you also said that your dad was looking for him i said after recovering from the momentary surprise oliver smiled it wasnta complete lie the adults inside really were looking for him well then i glad you didntlie to him for my sake i smiled to show that i was joking and the group of adults started laughing again for a moment i thought they were laughing at the two of us but i realized that fear was groundless the adults didntcare about oliver and i having a conversation any more than the little kids starting a game of tag or the dancing teenagers in their own little worlds did we donthave anyone else to dance with oliver said matter of factly not insultingly i sure you could find someone oliver laughed a bit self consciously so that was a no it wasnta no i said starting to feel myself turning red i took a moment to wonder what had taken so long for me to start blushing then what was it it was a i just dontthink it a good idea i said why i grasped for words finally finding everything between us is going well how it is no need to risk messing that up by dancing oliver asked grinning i didntrespond i dontmean anything by it he insisted really i asked skeptically turning my body to face him directly oliver smiled a bit more we were only friends last time we danced yes i admitted so let dance he said sensing that he was about to win for our old friendship sake i paused before realizing that i was being stubborn there was no reason to say no no practical reason oh all right i conceded oliver smiled more genuinely and took a step in my direction holding his hand out for me to take once i d put my hand in his he put his other hand lightly on my waist and moved close enough that i could comfortably rest my other hand on his shoulder remember how he asked teasingly i shrugged a bit i guess the truth is that i thought that forgetting dance steps was the least of my potential problems oliver led and i followed his steps well enough i had to concentrate on what i was doing for a few minutes but the steps took my mind away from whom i was dancing with and i loosened up a bit dontlook down oliver said i hadnteven realized i was watching our feet i snapped my head up quickly and saw him holding back a laugh i laughed instead which oliver took as permission to stop trying not to laugh arentyou glad you agreed to this he said half jokingly yeah see what were you afraid of he laughed i didntanswer and caught myself before looking at the ground again instead i settled for moving my gaze to over his shoulder laura nothing i wasntafraid of anything i smiled without showing any teeth while cursing myself for not saying this immediately after he d asked his question you re lying he said there was no point in lying again if he was able to tell if i was doing it i was just a little worried because things didntturn out so well last time i said yes i think he winced slightly it was hard to tell in the faint light and i felt badly for hurting his feelings oliver steps got smaller but he didntstop dancing things didntturn out so badly not for our careers i agreed but you and i ended up hardly talking for five years oliver lowered his gaze dontlook down i said mockingly trying to lift some of the heaviness that had entered our discussion oliver looked back at me and smiled slightly at the joke i guess things didntturn out so well between us oliver had to admit i just dontwant to go through all of that again i donteither i resisted the impulse to tell him that it was his fault that wasntgoing to help anything i owe you an apology oliver said both of my eyebrows shot up in shock i definitely dropped a step or two of the dance and my jaw might have even dropped oliver took my reaction rather well he laughed i know i horrible at apologizing yes you re willing to listen anyway if apology meant that he was going to admit that he had been wrong and that i had been right then i absolutely was willing to listen yes i said instead of what i wanted to say oliver took a minute to gather his thoughts we kept dancing and i dontthink he realized we were he could probably dance in his sleep but it still took a bit of concentration for me to match his steps in time to the music so i took back my arm that was resting near his neck coming out of his thoughts he took his hand off my waist and looked around us let move away from the crowd meaning the group of hogwarts students who were dancing near us i followed him as he moved through the kids playing tag they hardly recognized our intrusion in their game unless they were using us as shields to hide from the boy who was it oliver stopped walking once we d reached a point where there were no people not even little children within earshot a large tree was growing nearby blocking whatever light was coming from the moon some light coming from a window in the house made it so that i could make out oliver profile but little else and i had a feeling that oliver had chosen the place because the darkness would hide his facial expressions it even colder over here i complained drawing my cloak closer around my body maybe by half a degree that colder i persisted oliver wasntabout to move closer to the other people in the yard we ll go back inside soon this wonttake long i had my doubts about this oliver and i had never had a short important conversation and our apologizes tended to be the longest discussions i decided not to point this out on the chance that doing so would prevent oliver from apologizing at all ok apology oliver said after several moments of silence and shivering on my part after a minute of waiting for the apology i had to say something that wasntit was it oliver smiled slightly i think no thank merlin i said smiling back i might not have spoken to you for another five years if it had been oliver laughed at the joke as only one of the two of us could fully appreciatively of the humor but also a little sadly that what i need to apologize for i wasntsure what he meant so i didntrespond i shifted my weight a little to make myself more comfortable for what i was now sure would take a while i tried to block out the noises coming from the crowd behind me the sounds made me want to turn around and see what was going on but i didntwant oliver to think i wasntpaying attention for not writing i mean for five years he said as if this explained everything you wrote a little only in response to your christmas cards you do know christmas is in december not february right i laughed shortly i have to put them off for two months before i can face writing them yeah that why i dontbother i just write back to the people who send cards to me which you did every year i said still a bit unsure why he felt the need to say that he was sorry for this instead of other things that i thought necessitated an apology but my letters didnt say anything no neither did yours i shrugged a little what was there to say joan tells us both everything there is to write about yes but you re missing my point oliver said frustrated he backed up a few steps to put his back up against the tree we were standing under making it even harder for me to see his face i stayed in place i think i am i apologizing for being such a horrible friend for the past five years i didntknow what to say he hadntbeen a great friend but neither had i i broke up with you and cut off all communication for a year and well you promised we d always be friends oliver explained i clearly remembered the promise he was speaking of immediately we d been standing in front of the window in the small hallway near gryffindor tower the same hallway in which he d broken up with me the night before oliver last quidditch match at hogwarts i d finally admitted to myself that i hadntwanted to be only his friend moments after making that promise the memory scared me more than it should have i didntwrite either i said uncharacteristically trying to share some of the blame no but i broke up with you so it was my responsibility to write that what i said i muttered to myself oliver chuckled see yes i said plainly after a short pause so that my agreement wasntrude oliver and i didntsay anything for a few minutes at first we looked at one another waiting for the other to keep the conversation moving but our gazes started wandering once it became clear that neither of us wanted to speak next there wasntmuch for me to look at since my back was to the action i gazed absently into the dark wooded backyard nothing distracted me from my thoughts there was no wind so not even the trees moved it worse than not just writing oliver said suddenly he didntgive me a chance to respond to that statement i wanted to warn you about protecting your house for months and i only had the nerve to do it at the wedding i what if something had happened oliver interrupted nothing did happen i said unnerved by his unease it very well could have i know you heard about madame rosmerta being under the imperius curse yeah i said everyone had heard about it joan told me about how something tried to break into your house that same year you arentsuggesting i am oh i doubt malfoy would have thought of you thank merlin but it may have been someone wanting to steal something valuable i said quickly oliver paused but only briefly so what if it was only a robbery that could have happened before the wedding too yes but dontapologize for trying to help me i should have written is all i saying i know and maybe you should have but at least you told me when you did and it prevented a robbery i looked down quickly so thank you i d wanted to thank him since the attempted robbery nothing had happened i d heard someone trying to get in through the door and a window in the living room in the middle of the night it still had frightened me badly the only reason i d told joan about it had been so she d tell oliver it had been my way of thanking him until i had a real opportunity to do so you re welcome i looked back up at him smiling feeling better is there anything else you d like to apologize for oliver seemed to debate this shortly i thought he was just playing along until he said yes yes i very very sorry for not having told my dad i was dating you while we were actually dating he said almost too quickly for me to understand him i think you already apologized for that i said after deciphering what he d said i didn t but i should have so i am now it ok i said i wasntmad anymore when i brought it up i know oliver said there was another short lull in conversation before he abruptly added which is why i sorry for some of the things i said about you late that night after the wedding what i asked raising my voice slightly i was rather drunk and angry that well that things between us had gotten so bad they werentso bad i was expecting a lot worse i said i was expecting things to go back to normal it wasntall my fault that they didn t i said sharply imagining some of the worst things he could have said about me while drunk or sober for that matter which is why i apologizing for what i said what d you say i demanded oliver gave a short forced laugh i not that stupid laura you re stupid enough to admit that you said anything at all i trying to be honest oliver said all right who d you talk about me with oliver long hesitation let me know that i wasntgoing to like the answer his answer didntgo against my dread dad he muttered oh lovely i said i was sorry you went home drunk in the middle of the night to talk to your father i asked oliver shrugged i said i was drunk which implied that i wasntthinking anything else i asked more seriously this time yes he said immediately oh my god i reverted to my muggle curses this is going to sound bad at first so dontget too angry until you hear me out ok i said suspiciously and not completely honestly ok i sorry that i didnttell you the whole reason i was breaking up with you oliver said not moving his gaze from my face what i asked dangerously after what he d said sunk in i didntknow myself at the time so you didntbreak up with me because you didntthink we d be able to concentrate enough on work oh no that was part of it at the time i thought that was all of it ok but it wasntall of it oliver said discreetly what was the rest of it i asked crossing my arms not to keep warm i panicked laura oliver said almost miserably he leaned a bit more into the tree behind him how do you mean i asked hardly aware of the adults who were watching the children laughing uproariously at something everything was changing so quickly there were n e w t s graduation moving away from friends and suddenly i holding this letter about quidditch the thing i used to run to in order to escape from change and instead that letter made me want to run to something else oliver explained using his hands to gesture but otherwise not moving from his slouched position against the tree trunk to what i asked already guessing his answer you he admitted but that didntseem stable either suddenly with work would come less time together we d be making new friends possibly growing apart so the more i thought about our relationship not lasting the more i turned back to quidditch only to realize that it had become less important because i didnt need to run back to it anymore but i wanted it to be important i wanted it to be everything because it always had been does this make any sense no oliver sighed frustrated in my mind losing quidditch was like losing myself quidditch was me so i had to get it back then i heard percy telling adam or mark i dontremember which how he and penelope had broken up for the sake of their careers and it made sense if i only had quidditch to focus on it d be everything again i stared at him intently for a minute thinking about what he d said i still didntreally understand his logic but i was more thinking about the fact that there had been something emotional behind oliver decision to break up with me i had thought that he had only had success on his mind when he had resolved to end the relationship i had thought that his emotions were completely on my side i wish you would have told me all of that at the time so that i could have told you how stupid you were being i wasntbeing stupid oliver said a bit defensively i wasnttrying to take quidditch place i never said you tried why does it matter if i was taking its place i asked showing him that i still didntunderstand i thought i was losing quidditch i thought that not needing to hide in the sport meant that it was becoming less important it was i stated exactly and what else did i have quidditch was who i was is who i am i gaped at him for several seconds thoroughly surprised by what he d just said how is it that i never convinced you that that wasn t and still isn t true i practically yelled out of disappointment in both of us my god oliver i thought you d moved past that idea years ago oliver didntsay anything there a difference between what you do and who you are i said more composedly you ve always said that but it not true it is true i started raising my voice again it not he snapped if you cantsee yourself by what you do how else can you see yourself he slowly added by seeing yourself through the eyes of someone else oliver didntanswer yet again he merely crossed his own arms do you think i saw you as gryffindor captain do you think your father sees you as puddlemere keeper i asked no because it not who you are then who am i if you know me so well oliver asked starting to raise his own voice for the first time you re you i answered pathetically how do you tell someone who they are in mere words when you ve clearly failed so dismally in showing them who they are through actions and feelings i haventknown who that is in five years oliver said quietly you obviously didntknow then i said bitterly and you knew who you were oliver asked skeptically no but i was making progress and i wasn t i hope you were i said i thought you were i had less progress to make oliver said obviously without thinking first i took it as a blow and a rather low one at that i sorry oliver said right away either seeing my expression or sensing from the silence that what he d said had hurt what do you mean you had less progress to make i managed to keep control in my voice oliver uncrossed his arms and used one hand to push himself off the tree he took a few steps toward me but i took one step back to stop his progress i didntmean anything by it he insisted you re lying i said and i wasntguessing he wasntthe only one who could detect an obvious lie when he heard one i only meant that you were dealing with more than i was at the time with percy and dan oliver said so i didntknow who i was because percy was being an ass and because dan was dead i asked coldly no laura that not what i said and you know it then i have no idea what you said because that what it sounded like to me oliver couldntcome up with a response do you mean that you were better at helping me with my problems than i was at helping you with yours i asked plainly of course not oliver said taking another step forward because you were better at it i said uncrossing my arms oliver looked down and i sorry that i wasntbetter i said looking down too i started to feel tears prickle my eyes but a little blinking stopped it i wouldntcry over what i d said i felt better after admitting it i d been thinking it was true through most of the conversation for much longer than that really hey oliver said getting me to raise my head he was looking at me again you helped me more than you know i smiled slightly it had been his way of admitting that what i had said was true but that it was ok i just wasntas good at helping myself i wasntsure how he said you just have to pay more attention to how other people see you i will oliver promised because i promise you that they see more than a quidditch player oliver looked at me as carefully as he could in the poor lighting before nodding i sorry for hurting you it ok i already not angry anymore i thought about this and decided that it was close enough to being true to make correcting myself unnecessary i dontmean for just now he said well for that too but that not what i meant i sorry for hurting you when i broke up with you if i could take back the decision it ok i interrupted i stopped being angry over that years ago i know but i still wanted to explain i glad you did were you still angry at the wedding oliver asked drawing his own cloak around him a bit more tightly it was getting colder outside as it usually does at night yes i admitted i thought so had you figured out all of the reasons for breaking up with me by the wedding mostly he said shrugging slightly you should have said something i didntthink you d listen oliver responded laughing slightly i probably wouldnthave oliver someone called from near the house oliver looked over my shoulder and i turned my head to see a woman standing near the open kitchen door almost everyone had left the backyard and wondered how i could have missed the commotion a few adults were left gathering a few younger children to go inside for the minute of silence and spectacular fireworks that would bring in the new year are you two coming in for the fireworks the woman asked loudly we ll be inside in a moment aunt celeste oliver called back why should i have said something he asked me getting right back to the discussion on the off chance that i would have been not as stubborn as normal i turned back to him and smiled would anything have turned out differently probably not oliver started laughing at first slightly and then a bit more and i quickly joined him maybe someday we ll stop sucking at life he said speak for yourself i joked oh you think you ve gotten better at life than i have he played along no idea but i ve gotten better how so oliver asked seriously but still grinning i had to think for several seconds before coming up with well i never once threw you in a lake during this whole conversation and i wouldnthave even if there was a lake at hand not even when you deserved it oliver laughed and i not holding a grudge except maybe for you talking to your dad about me as if he didnthate me enough oliver started i said you re sorry i know hey oliver said as if something had just occurred to him i apologized for four things tonight admitted that i was wrong he grinned see how much you ve helped me he said half kidding there hope for us yet really oliver asked sure he paused slightly for us i quickly started turning red and looked down it hadntbeen what i d meant but at the same time no had not leapt immediately into my mind when he d asked the question it should have i thought oliver laughed awkwardly and i joined in the laughter yet again because there was nothing else i could do hope for you and hope for me he clarified definitely i agreed quickly we ll be ok especially with a friend to help out of course i agreed nodding i grinned i promised promised that once we were friends we always would be and this time i was pretty sure that we could actually carry out the vow oliver took another step towards me are you two coming or not you ll miss it we re coming adam i called recognizing his voice and spinning around before hurrying towards him oliver followed me to the door where adam met us smiling innocently as usual author note the next chapter is finished and will be up soon chapter 19 clich adam oliver and i walked into the main room for the new year party just in time for the moment of silence the three of us stood somberly looking down but my mind was running wildly i wouldntallow myself to think in words because my own thoughts concerning the conversation i d just had with oliver scared me what was left when i for the most part eliminated the words from my mind were the strong feelings of confusion and hope i think i d missed him i d missed having a friend who already knew everything that i d been through while growing up i d missed knowing someone well enough to know what that person meant even when i couldntsee his face i d missed the relative ease of communication even when that communication came through bickering spats or awkward yet telling silence the fireworks were a welcome relief from the effort it took not to pay attention to the few thoughts that were breaking through the barrier i was trying to put up between my subconscious and consciousness the show was as spectacular as i d remembered it being the last time i d visited oliver house the fireworks lingered near the ceiling spelling words and painting picture through sparks of light i noticed several quidditch related shapes including some banners supporting puddlemere united and the team keeper there was no chance to speak to anyone after the last of the fireworks had been exploded people immediately started lining up in the middle of the room to be chosen for wizards and warlocks adam was the most enthusiastic of all and oliver and i followed closely behind him we stood on opposite sides of adam who was the first to be chosen he had still never been on a losing team of the magic equivalent of capture the flag mark rose and i joined him on the wizards team that year and the rest of the old seventh years ended up with the warlocks only tara chose not to play saying that she should stay with her daughter and i sure tara welcomed the excuse not to participate once everyone who wanted to play had been separated into opposing teams mr wood explained the rules briefly passed out armbands and sent the teams out to hide their flags rose and i fell to the back of the group of wizards who decided to hide the flag on the ground behind a tree near the center of our side of the large wooded yard one of the rules in wizards and warlocks was that only two people could guard the flag so some of the older men on our team came up with a strategy that involved sending some pairs of people as pseudo guards all that the pairs had to do was listen for people approaching and convince members of the opposing team that the flag was near them the warlocks would obviously come closer to try to spot the flag and the fake guards could not only tag them but do so in a way that implied that the warlocks had gotten too close to the flag for comfort hopefully the opposing team could never figure out exactly where the real flag was rose knew an easy job when she heard one and she immediately volunteered to watch over a nonexistent flag since she was the only one on my team except for mark and adam who would certainly pair up that i knew i said that i would be a decoy with her she approved the idea and the two of us hurried off near the west edge of the grounds to find a suitable spot to stand throughout the game not long after we d found a nice large tree to stroll around a horn sounded the beginning of the first out of a potential three games the game ended up making the match in which i d ended up in a net with oliver seem like the epitome of fun everything that rose and i could have spoken of we had already covered during the long conversation with the other seventh years during dinner and i suppose we werentreally supposed to be speaking anyway a few warlocks fell for our trap at the beginning of the game but we apparently werentconvincing enough in our role because it was clear that the other team had learned to avoid our area of the playing field by the middle of the forty minute long game the two of us ended up sitting on the ground with our backs up against a large tree and my mind started wandering back to the conversation with oliver again i had to concentrate on making sure that i didntheed a few of the things i was thinking i tried to focus on the things that he d apologized for instead of the apologies themselves i reflected on how i had almost failed at helping him instead of how much he had assisted me and i thought a lot about how i meant to follow through with my promise to always be his friend no matter what your hair looks like shit rose said loudly i looked over at her quickly scowling thanks a lot she smirked you should have heard what i said about your cloak your hair was about the fifth thing i insulted trying to get your attention oh i said looking into the distance on the off chance that someone from the other team would come into view giving me an excuse to get up sorry it fine rose said and she meant it what i said three times before trying to get your attention was that i think the game should be over soon i checked my watch it only been a little over half an hour we could be here for another hour nice optimism rose said sarcastically i laughed a little sorry the two of fell back into silence and my thoughts quickly went back to where they d been before she d interrupted them i haventbeen paying much attention to you and oliver tonight rose said and i was pretty sure that she wasntrepeating herself i turned to look at her profile in the dim light again shrugging you haventbeen paying much attention to anyone tonight except for flint we didnttake it personally i joked true rose said shortly but now that i paying more attention she d let her sentence trail off but i was confident that i wasntgoing to like what was sure to come i glad that you re so happy i tried to distract her saying the first thing i could think of that had nothing to do with me thanks you re welcome you re in love with oliver she said bluntly without missing a beat i opened my mouth to respond but no words came out of my mouth i just sat on the cold ground with my mouth gaping open while leaning up against a tree in the middle of what was turning out to be a boring and now embarrassing match of wizards and warlocks things could be worse rose said not putting any more emotion into her voice because he in love with you too spoken language was still lost on me mark mentioned that the two of you were outside for quite a long time which all of us know means that the two of you were fighting about something or other doubtlessly something that happened years ago i couldntdeny that although she paused to offer me the opportunity to do so and if the two of you were left to yourselves it would probably take another six months before you finally admitted to each other that you loved each other however i sure that at this very moment joan is plotting ways to put you into an uncomfortable situation that sure will speed up the process but i know that joan set ups are far from fun you ve been through one i muttered three we wontgo there it not the point the point is that you are quite possibly the second most stubborn person on the face of the earth only second to oliver but you re not stupid your choices are to talk to oliver on your own terms or to suffer through one of joan good deeds i know what i would pick i was a little more uncertain oh come on laura rose said making sure that i could see her rolling her eyes take your happiness into your own hands for once i ve taken my happiness into my own hands before i snapped then do it again she responded a horn sounded from the house easily gaining our full attention we won she said simply standing i followed her cue and the two of us stretched our backs before starting towards the source of the loud sound to rejoin our team rose didntcontinue the lecture she left me to my own thoughts which was even worse than listening to her preach at me the second match between adam wizards and the warlocks was hardly a contest we wizards abandoned the fake flag approach even though it had worked and instead sent as many pairs as possible into the opposing side even though many people were tagged at the beginning of the game we located the flag within ten minutes after that it was only a matter of negotiating it so that a large group of us wizards arrived at the flag at the same time overwhelming the guards and safely running the opposing team flag over to our side of the playing field hence winning the game both sides were happy with the quick match not only because they considered the wizards win to be inevitable because that what side adam was on but because there was plenty of time for a quidditch match there was a small open area near the house avoided during wizards and warlocks for obvious strategic reasons with goals set up on both sides the pitch wasntthe official length of a professional quidditch pitch but both sides had the same advantages and disadvantages from the size difference so it worked people who had stayed inside during wizards and warlocks came outside to watch the quidditch match evidently it had been several years since a team had won the two out of three games required to end the wizards and warlocks competition in only two games so the guests were excited to see the return of quidditch to the new year party i had a small suspicion that they were also interested in seeing the new puddlemere keeper play in his own backyard i let myself admit to myself that i wanted to see the same thing there were no stands or bleachers for the spectators who instead gathered on the ground on the edges of the pitch some stronger lights than the ones in the backyard were brought outside and pointed towards the sky making it possible for the quidditch players to see what they were doing and for the people on the ground to watch choosing teams was much less official than it had been for wizards and warlocks oliver and mr wood were the captains for the two teams and they asked whomever they wanted of those who had brought brooms to join them adam and mark were automatically on oliver team and i gathered with the rest of the seventh years to cheer them on most of the crowd was more apt to cheer for mr wood team everyone likes the underdogs would any of you like to play oliver asked walking up behind me and addressing the group we say no absolutely every year rose said from flint arms if anything they d gotten even cuter after being reunited after the long separation caused by being on opposite teams during the previous two games of wizards and warlocks i ll play flint said squeezing his wife a little tighter you ll have to let go i muttered oliver laughed quietly behind me ok then with the weasley twins i ve got a full team come with me after a kiss from rose flint complied with oliver instructions you didntwant to play did you laura oliver asked after he d walked several steps away i turned no i definitely don t he smirked just thought i d ask thanks but no i repeated he nodded and hurried off to strategize quickly before the match i avoided rose gaze as i turned back to the group i listened as my friends talked about some other quidditch matches they remembered from when they were younger this was the first year that oliver team was expected to win although it wouldntbe the first year they did win fourteen wizards and witches on brooms were in the air within fifteen minutes of when flint had joined oliver team mr wood team wore some red reflective tape on the backs and sleeves of their normal cloaks so that the people on the ground could tell who was on each team i also thought that it might give mr wood team a slight advantage because they could more easily see each other in the air the red tape didntprove to be enough of an advantage mr wood keeper was more than competent especially considering the strange lighting but oliver was professionally trained he d been good at hogwarts but even i could tell that he d gotten better the other players had a very small chance of putting the quaffle past him you let that in mr wood accused after making the only goal his team would make only if you can prove it oliver said seriously and loudly enough that everyone on the ground could hear him mr wood laughed heartily before jokingly shaking his fist at his son and flying after the other chasers to the opposite side of the small pitch flint captured the snitch one charmed to stay within a certain area like the ones i had seen in the window at the quidditch supply shop after about half an hour securing a win for oliver team the crowd clapped politely before heading back inside where it was warm we former classmates waited on the sidelines for our friends who joined us still excited by their predicted win the boys led the way back into the woods home and into the large room where the party was taking place joan joined me at the rear of the group made a bit paranoid by rose warnings i kept joan involved in a conversation about her experiences at st mungo so that she wouldnthave a chance to pick her own subject matter we continued the chat once we d entered the room which was less crowded than it had been during dinner several people were hovering nearby mr and mrs wood trying to appear as if they werentwaiting for their chance to thank their hosts and to excuse themselves from the party evan interrupted my talk with joan to ask her to dance which i urged her to accept she did so although she looked a little hurt by my apparent excitement to get rid of her i smiled and told her that i didntwant to take time away from evan which he laughingly thanked me for joan accepted the excuse and joined her boyfriend on the dance floor which held several couples mainly middle aged i stood in place uncertain what i should do i glanced over at the table that i d eaten dinner at but no one was sitting there and i didntreally feel like sitting alone waiting for someone to join me i glanced at my watch noting that it was a little after three seeing a good reason to be tired allowed everything that had happened to catch up with me and i yawned carefully surveying the room i finally spotted oliver with his back to me getting a late night snack at a table with adam and mark the knot in my stomach gave me one more reason to call it a night and i walked over intending to thank him for extending his cousin invitation and for the nice evening i would have done exactly that had i not caught my name while approaching the group of three friends i stopped in my tracks and none of the boys noticed that i had approached i moved a little closer so that i could hear their conversation justifying my eavesdropping by telling myself that if they were talking about me i had a right to know what they were saying the truth is that i probably would have considered eavesdropping even if i hadntheard my name you saw how quickly she ran away adam oliver said holding a cookie not one of mine but not seeming very interested in eating it it was almost time for the fireworks i would have run too mate adam said before taking a bite of something oliver shook his head no believe me she was running from me he brought a hand up to his forehead i shouldnthave asked her if there was still a chance for us he mimicked himself mark started laughing although to be fair he did try to mask the laugh by pretending to cough loudly sorry wood he apologized i sure that had nothing to do with it mark lied turning his head to search the table for something to eat oliver turned his head to glare at mark and i froze to avoid being caught in the act of listening when i shouldnthave been fortunately oliver turned his gaze back to the food she hardly looked at me since then oliver continued finally taking a bite out of the cookie she hardly been around you since then mark reasoned what should i do oliver asked putting a hand on the table and leaning forward to shift his weight off his legs adam shrugged you could tell her how you feel he said simply with a mouth half full of food how do you feel mark asked looking over at his friend barely managing not to laugh oliver didntnotice mark amusement i love her he said sounding as if he was surrendering a large smile spread across my face without my thinking about it as i ignored the tone of voice hearing only the words hell i understood the tone of his voice we both were giving in our whole relationship involved giving in we d given into our assumptions during our fight during our second year we d given into loneliness when we became friends during seventh year we d given into our feelings later that year no one else on earth at that moment could have understood why oliver sounded so defeated as i did oh merlin dontsay you never stopped loving her mark said completely seriously the smile on his face turning into a mocking grimace adam nodded laughing it clich he added oliver started to turn his body so that he could glare at his friends a bit more effectively and possibly so that he could walk away from them why he turned wasntreally important at the time what was important was that i was about to get caught eavesdropping i had to either run or say something i never stopped i said quickly loudly and clearly enough to be heard by all three boys standing in front of me my smile only slightly faltered when all of them spun around oliver the most quickly and i realized what i had just said no one responded to my outburst and i didnttake my eyes away from oliver at first he looked nothing if not horrified and blood rushed into his cheeks but as he saw my smile the horror started to be replaced with hope what oliver asked after several seconds a smile starting to play at his own lips i loved you i said trying to sound calm and i never stopped again silence fell between the four of us oliver smile grew bigger and i took a moment to glance over at mark and adam who were also grinning although still looking surprised adam looked over at mark i ll be damned he said simply and sincerely mark didnttake his eyes off me why didntyou say something sooner you were killing the poor bloke he motioned towards oliver i followed mark gesture and looked back at oliver who was still staring i laughed releasing some of my nerves so that my voice wouldntshake i was scared not scared that things werentgoing to turn out well not scared that i was going to be rejected i was scared by the possibilities of what would happened after everything did turn out well because i stupid i said answering mark question and because i stubborn and proud as hell i let my broad idiotic smile show a bit of an apology but mainly stupid all of us looked to oliver for a response but he was unable or unwilling to give one at the moment she not the only stupid one mark said to oliver no oliver admitted before laughing oliver beamed down at me but he didntmove after several seconds of nothing happening adam finally snapped just kiss her he said impatiently oliver nodded once before taking the few steps necessary to reach me he put his arms around me so that his hands were on my back before pulling me to him bending down and bringing his lips to mine i closed my eyes and wrapped my arms around his neck convincing myself that everything was really happening and that it should be happening after a minute i pulled away a little and put my hands lightly on both sides of oliver face please dontscrew it all up this time it will take another five years to fix everything and i dontlike the five years between when we re friends oliver smiled sweetly drawing me even closer to him it your turn to screw up i laughed dont let me screw it up or i probably will that probably true mark interjected oliver shook his head still looking down at me he didnthave much of a choice his face was still between my hands she won t i stood up on my toes and leaned my head to the side to kiss him again for merlin sake adam said if we dontstop them they re going to be worse than flint and rose all of us laughed and mark and adam jokingly walked on either side of oliver and took him by the arms they pulled him a few steps away from me although he didntlook away oliver remained a captive of mark and adam just long enough to ask will you dance with me laura i nodded without any hesitation yes mark and adam let go so that oliver could lead me to the dance floor i glanced back to smile at them thankfully and spotted mr wood standing near where everything had taken place he was watching oliver and me seriously his gaze stern and i suspected that i hadntbeen the only eavesdropper that night i gave him a small smile at first i was met only by coldness then mr wood looked down and turned his back on us my smile disappeared but not for long oliver stopped walking and faced me putting one hand on my lower back before bending down to kiss me quickly as oliver took my hand that wasnton his shoulder to dance we heard a loud noise of excitement coming from across the room although the noise stopped instantly it gained oliver attention and mine we began dancing but did not move in a circle as oliver had taught me to do five years previously instead we both intently watched joan who had taken the lead from evan and was turning their dance into a trek across the floor towards oliver and me it took her longer to reach us than it should have box steps are not the most efficient way of traveling when joan and evan finally came up next to us joan smiling madly stopped dancing and drew oliver and me into a large hug oliver and i let go of each other hands to return her hug she pulled away quickly taking our hands and pushing them back together oliver squeezed my hand and grinned but we faced our friend instead of continuing our dance oh i so happy that the two of you finally came to your senses she said tears entering her eyes you can stop plotting against us now oliver said laughingly joan looked at him her eyes widening out of indignation i was not plotting against you two oliver and i gave her skeptical looks i was plotting for you she muttered grinning up at us i was helping evan admitted he reached out and hit oliver in the shoulder sympathetically i was actually going to feel badly for putting you through it wood you wouldnthave felt badly oliver countered no probably not evan laughed sounding insanely like his older brother so when the wedding joan asked seriously looking at me i turned bright red but i couldnthelp laughing it kind of early early he fell in love with you ten years ago ten years oliver asked quickly yeah when you were first starting school joan said oliver shook his head that not true he said quickly joan looked surprised but she recovered quickly anyway there will be a wedding right oliver and i didntsay anything i glanced up at him to see him peeking down at me both of us started turning red and looked away which made all four of us laugh there will be a wedding joan said quite seriously to evan after the laughter had died down i didntgo through all of that work during our seventh year for nothing if we leave them alone maybe he ll ask her evan suggested looking over at the two of us and giving us a quick grin i thought that adam probably would have winked but evan was a bit more subtle than his brother joan laughed and looked at evan are you telling me i should leave them alone would i tell you that evan joked joan rolled her eyes at him before looking directly at me i ll leave but i d better have a good spot to watch the wedding and i dontmean a seat in the front row i grinned i know what you mean and she prompted i dontthink you re supposed to request to be a bridesmaid at evan started oh is that what you re talking about oliver interjected well hell who else would we make the matron of honor i slowly moved my head to look at him questioningly hypothetically oliver added quickly joan almost giggled let leave these two alone evan she said as if it had been her idea have a nice night you two the couple ended up deciding to leave for the night and they quickly thanked oliver for inviting them promising that they d come again the following year as i hugged joan goodbye i whispered thanks for being so nosy i smiled at her gratefully as we pulled out of the hug i only so nosy because i care joan said so that all of us could hear her evan laughed even harder than i did he put his hand on his girlfriend back and started to lead her away i hear that every day he said over his shoulder as the couple left oliver and me alone in the middle of the dance floor do you think she really was coming up with a plan for how to get us back together i asked moving my eyes off the retreating couple and back to the man holding my hand i have no doubts that she was oliver said completely seriously i grinned we re lucky we had her oliver nodded we wouldntbe standing here together without her he acknowledged we ll make it up to her someday he nodded again smiling broadly i let go of his hand so that i could put both of my hands behind his head i stood up on my toes to meet him halfway as he leaned down to kiss me after several seconds oliver wrapped his arms around me and pulled me closer and closer to him turning our kiss into an ardent hug i didntprotest on the contrary i slid my arms more around his shoulders so that i could hug him back i didntcare that the two of us were standing in the middle of a still semi crowded room in his parents house it had been a long time since he d hugged me so fervently and i didntwant him to let go laura oliver asked oliver i said gently placing my forehead against the hollow between his neck and his collarbone i didntfall in love with you ten years ago i smiled i know that it was nine i was a second year i blinked and moved back only far enough to be able to see his eyes you re lying oliver shook his head slightly no second year i wontsay that i never stopped you re not lying i said pulling back just a little more to take in his whole face but you cantfall in love when you re twelve he shrugged his shoulders a little moving my arms that were resting on them you fell in love at fourteen what the difference i dontknow two years i wasnteven thinking about this kind of thing when we were twelve i wasnt thinking about it i didntthink about it for years he laughed to himself you know when i finally did think about it no when you scared the shit out of me in the forbidden forest it was like when we were kids joking around with percy well joking around with percy present percy used to joke around with us too oliver nodded shortly anyway i remembered how much i missed you at that point i lowered my eyebrows a little skeptically you hid it well no there was just nothing left to hide like i said i couldnthonestly tell you that i never stopped loving you after our second year i looked around us quickly younger and middle aged couples without children were scattered throughout the room talking and mr and mrs wood were still dealing with an unending queue of quests to thank for coming and to invite back to the festivities the following year adam and tara were standing at our table adam gathering their daughter things and tara holding the sleeping claire cedar and dave were sitting at the table talking to tara about something flint and rose were flirting in a corner and mark was still at the table of food searching for anything worthy of taking back to his flat and merlin only knew where percy was everyone had changed so much since we d started school the relationships between us had changed and i finally accepted it we were different than we d been at age eleven and twelve but we werentunrecognizable and most of our relationships though different were still intact the relationships that hadnt changed had fallen apart i just thought you d like to know oliver said after waiting for a response i snapped out of my thoughts and smiled as sweetly as i could i am glad to know i shouldnthave said anything i mean it was a long time ago it was i smirked slightly teasingly of course it was the only thing you ve admitted to me tonight that has made me want to kiss you more than it made me want to kick you the only thing oliver asked taking one of his arms from around me so that he could bring a hand through some of my hair yes i said plainly the others were how you told you dad drunken stories about me how you didntwrite to warn me about the danger you thought i was in how you broke up with me for very complicated reasons that i still dontunderstand and for um being a horrible friend oliver helped right those are rather kick worthy offenses he said shrugging slightly again before moving his hand under my chin yes i agreed though you apologized for some rather heavy stuff as well yes i said more reluctantly he laughed under his breath at me before asking i haventadmitted anything else to you that made you want to kiss me i furrowed my brow trying to think of something but he interrupted my concentration i haventadmitted that i love you he asked softly my heat skipped a beat a smile lit my face quickly while my cheeks grew hot i think you might have told mark and adam he moved his hand from under my chin to my cheek i love you simple three words three words that i d heard from him from a couple other men my family and some close friends surely by now after people have used the words so many times when they didntreally mean it or when they werentreally thinking about what they were saying the phrase means very little but to me at that moment the phrase wasntworn out it wasnta clich because in those words he d said more than a clich ever could at that moment those words meant everything worth saying or worth feeling or hearing or touching or tasting at that moment the scene didntremind me of every i love you scene in any romance novel or movie because it wasntlike any of them and i love you i never stopped he said grinning in a way that showed me that the three words had meant just as much to him except after our second year i reminded him he laughed loudly ok he conceded i brought both of my arms from his shoulders and cupped his face drawing closer to him i ll never stop i whispered oliver didntrespond in words he didnthave to author note only an epilogue left to wrap up a few loose ends but this is the end of the main part of the story i can hardly believe it almost done expect a long author note after the epilogue until then i ll thank marie electronicquillster on mugglenet read her story for all of her help with these last three chapters and i ll thank all of the people who have given me their support i cantsay how much it has helped without using clich s so i ll let a simple thank you say it all author note thank you for continuing in this chapter more on the nature of oliver and laura relationship please review chapter 2 the truth is but a vision the next morning i joined percy at breakfast he looked up at me and smiled good morning i said looking down at my plate morning he said how are you fine i said a little harshly you dontsound fine yeah well i said he didntrespond at first did you have fun at hogsmeade for the most part what d you do he asked biting into his toast talked to joan rose cedar and tara i said he swallowed and frowned slightly why because they asked me to join them i said frowning back why he asked again looking confused they were being nice but why oh what do you care i asked grabbing a piece of toast from the center of the table what do you mean by that i grabbed a napkin stood up and turned my back on him figure it out percy i snapped heading out of the great hall i passed joan and professor mcgonagall who were standing in the hall right outside of the great hall her please professor i cantdo joan was saying professor mcgonagall looked a little unsure i ate breakfast in the hall outside of the transfiguration classroom people mainly from ravenclaw started coming eventually wendy lowe sat down next to me hey can you do me a favor she asked what i asked with no curiosity wendy and i got along but werentexactly friends give this to adam still for me she asked handing over a piece of parchment i sighed i don t i cantgive it to him myself and you re a gryffindor she said dropping the letter in my lap thank you she said standing up and leaving i rolled my eyes and stood up as well professor mcgonagall was coming to unlock the classroom joan was talking to her again and professor mcgonagall was nodding slowly i sat in my normal place in the front row on the corner next to the windows next to percy except now percy was sitting in the desk that was front and center and in front of penelope good morning we re working on transfiguring medical equipment out of natural materials this week you will have a partner to work with you ll be going outside today to gather materials you believe will be useful on wednesday and friday you will be given a hypothetical medical emergency and must attempt to solve it with the materials you gathered your textbooks will help you partners let see treeman and creevey spencer and still weasley and lowe she kept pairing people up i was one of the last two people to be paired up and debman and wood mcgonagall said looking just a little guilty my jaw dropped and i prepared myself to object but the rest of the class was doing that for me just by muttering their shock wood and i were not paired up percy and wood were not paired up ever not even by snape no switching partners containers for collecting materials are next to the door now go outside mcgongall said wood and i had the same idea we were at mcgonagall desk arguing before anyone else even had the chance to stand up the class filed out slowly as wood and i tried to talk over each other no absolutely not crazy we re stupidest idea joan did she put you shut up mcgonagall said throwing up her hands it about time you two put your childish issues behind you and grew up either get along for a few hours or fail now go i was shocked professor mcgonagall as strict as she was never told anyone to shut up and never insulted us wood and i walked away muttering obscenities under our breath we picked up some containers and left the castle in complete silence outside of the big oak doors leading into the castle we both stopped to think i opened my book to the correct chapter and started skimming the text grass moss scum off the top of the lake those are easy enough oak bark pine needles not too bad after that it starts getting more interesting poison ivy poison oak lady breath venus flytrap teeth sap from enchanted trees roots from nightshade pollen from blue bonnet cats eye dream catcher guard feet look i ll go this way and you go in the opposite direction all right wood said pointing towards hagrid cabin i shrugged fine with me the forbidden forest is on your side of the grounds have fun finding some of this stuff wolfsbane bloodvine dementor hug i can only imagine some of the creatures that would eat this stuff wood shivered very slightly right well we cantgo into the forest anyway it off limits where else would we get this it for a class now i dontknow about you but i not entirely fond of the forbidden forest or the caves which are in my direction and where we ll need to find some of this fungi in situations like this i not very picky about whose company i in i said dog earring the page with a chart of commonly transfigured plants wood didntanswer at first he just started off in the direction of the forest i was a little surprised and insulted of course after he was a few meters from the bottom of the stairs that led up to the oak doors he turned towards me well well what i asked unwilling to just hand over a victory he d have to ask me to come i d rather face the forest than the caves he said so i d gain a victory later the truth was i d rather face the forest too let get the normal things first ok i asked hurrying down the stairs after him and then heading towards the lake any idea how to identify an oak from every other tree around this place my business is with the sky not the ground wood said i rolled my eyes how poetic anyway tell that to the tree you flew into during our first year i said smirking if i wasntso busy watching you and percy to make sure you didntkill yourselves i wouldnthave flown into it as i recall i was yelling at you because you were flying straight for the owlery he said and i missed it you didn t you just flew in one window and out another that easier said than done apparently percy ran into one of the owl cages poor owl didntsee what was coming i laughed a little caught myself and scowled again it not our fault you werentwatching where you were going no well tell that to the tree i hit because it seems to blame the two of you for the whole incident wood said i smiled but turned my head so he couldntsee so how are percy and penelope wood asked tauntingly jealous i asked of penel because percy has a girlfriend while you mr captain of gryffindor quidditch team are single i said see it funny i care more about my friends than some girl who comes along he said whatever i muttered right see i forgot what does laura know about friendship anyway he said coldly he didntsound like he was just taunting me anymore he sounded angry and hurt what i asked narrowing my eyes as i bent down to pull up some grass by a large rock by the lake you heard me oh i heard you i just cantbelieve you said it what that supposed to mean you who stabbed your best friend in the back i spat standing up so he wasnttowering over me me he asked his eyes wide jaw dropped me who betrayed whom first what and i still made the team second year using one of the school crappy broomsticks what are you talking about i asked louder and angrier he stole my broom he took your broom because he was having charlie improve it your broom wasntexactly great wood you never noticed that it flew ten times better after you got it back charlie weasley filed down those knots on the handle and straightened out the tail you werentsupposed to try out for the team until the next day you went early you git percy wanted to surprise you it was supposed to be a gift i said i leaned over to scoop out some pond scum in a little container professor mcgonagall had given each group the next thing i knew i was being pushed into the lake i fell face down into the knee deep water and stood up quickly i turned to wood fuming you re lying he said i not you had our whole house against him before he ever got a chance to explain you must have told everyone what you thought happened except with a new spin percy wasntjust sabotaging you you said no he was against gryffindor i cantbelieve they fell for it but you were part of the team then i said climbing out of the freezing water then a better idea came into my head and i took out my wand wingardium leviosa i said wood feet flew from under him i moved him effortlessly over the water and removed the charm he came out of the water sputtering you little you asked for it you i asked for it this whole thing was your fault what that right you betrayed me you took percy side no questions asked if you would ve stuck by us both we d all still be friends now if you d been a good friend if i d been a good friend you didntask questions before turning the whole house against him you didnteven think that your best friend wasnttrying to hurt you just to help you i asked crawling onto the large rock by the lake expelliarmus i said before he could magic me back into the water i caught his wand awkwardly but i still caught it you didntask questions before assuming i was just backstabbing him for no reason wood asked almost calmly as he climbed out of the lake it looked pretty bad to percy and me it looked like you backstabbed him for no reason and when the older weasleys turned the tables on me what about then i was alone laura completely alone no friends no one to even talk to no one and you just watched from a distance you had quidditch and quidditch is still all i have he said and now now what do i have we lost that match against hufflepuff hufflepuff you have friends and you can still win that damned cup if you want to with a little luck and if you win the rest of your games of course but you can still win i said standing right slytherin would have to lose to someone besides us and and ravenclaw can beat them and even if they did we d still probably have to beat slytherin by over one hundred points he finished bitterly which you can with the team you have the only reason you haventwon the cup yet is because potter has some rotten luck rotten luck if potter had rotten luck he d be dead about three times over by now at least i nodded as this was true if rumors were correct you can still win if you put your team up to it i said climbing off of the rock now look what you ve done we re both angry and wet i tossed him his wand he caught it easily and pointed it at himself repelio he was instantly dry i performed the same charm and tucked my wand into my pocket are we going to work on this project i see no alternatives he said all right then there still stuff we can get on the kinder parts of the grounds you re sure you canttell an oak from a spruce or a cedar no i can t he said ok we ll just have to take a stab in the dark then i said walking up to the nearest tree without needles and tearing off some bark i sorry i pushed you into the lake it was an immature impulsive thing to do wood said as if it pained him i nodded yes it was he waited that it yes it was i sighed took a deep breath and said and i sorry for magicking you into the lake it was a better way to do a very immature and impulsive thing wood actually laughed i have a feeling that the best i going to get so i accept your apology and i accept yours we walked on for a few more minutes good idea by the way disarming me i mean i was debating between a spell that would make you extremely heavy causing you to sink to the bottom of the lake or a curse that would suffocate you which would have been a less stylish approach to plan a i looked at him angrily and realizing he was only kidding smiled thanks we got a few more things on the list it took about an hour because the two of us were horrible at identifying plants after running out of plants we thought we could find on the grounds we were preparing ourselves for heading into the forbidden forest we ll only go in a little way right i asked how am i supposed to know wood said you ve never been in there have you he asked of course not percy my best friend the forest is off limits need i say more but you why would i go into the forest i spend too much time flying i looked into the forest and laughed slightly why did the sorting hat place us in gryffindor again no other house would take us wood guessed what does the hat do if you dontfit in any house i asked looking at him i ve heard you pick a number one through ten i laughed let just get this over with ladies first wood said motioning towards the forest oh you wimp i said not moving hey i put myself in front of hurled quaffles on an almost daily basis a wimp that doesntknow he a wimp that the worse kind of wimp there is i dontsee you walking in there he said starting forward just be the man of the situation eh i said sarcastically yeah yeah yeah he muttered heading through the first row of trees we re in so this is it not much of a rawrrrr i yelled grabbing the back of his neck with my fingertips he yelled and spun around to find me doubling over with laughter oh you will pay for that he said seemingly battling himself on whether he should be fuming mad or laughing hysterically with me oh will i maybe i should be the man of the situation i still hate you you know wood asked and i still hate you i said still laughing but not as forcefully i just wanted to make sure we were still on the same page he said walking farther into the forest we are we kept walking and the deeper into the trees we got the darker it got and the more afraid i got i dontknow what we re looking for i said finally we d been walking for many minutes you don t no i was waiting for you to point something out he said and i was waiting for you to point something out let just get out of here scared i asked smirking what that he asked pointing where i asked spinning around here he hissed in my ear i screamed and spun back around arms flailing he laughed easily blocking my swings ass i said you scared me first we were on the edge of the forest then i just want to get out of here there must be a reason this place is forbidden and i in no hurry to learn of it scared he mocked let just say i a stage above hearing and seeing things and a stage below peeing my pants oh thanks for that image he paused actually it kind of funny i laughed i ll tell you what i ll run in that way you run in the opposite way and we ll see who gets out first i said pointing in front of us fine with me you ll be running into the forest what i asked hogwarts is that way he said pointing to someplace about ninety degrees left of where i had pointed no it that way i pointed again you re crazy me oh this is stupid he got out his wand point me he paused we re both wrong it that way he pointed to a place in between where we had been pointing i was closer i said smiling you were not i clearly was closer to where he stopped when he saw my smirk mcgonagall right how so we do have some childish issues yeah well i started walking in the correct direction we also have some not so childish issues wood didntrespond after about fifteen minutes of arguing with myself i said i sorry what i sorry i said so he could hear me wood didntsay anything i should have been a better friend and heard you out no matter how bad it looked and i sorry he still didntanswer you want to know the truth it wasntpercy who was jealous it was me you stole my no one stole your damned broom wood then why were you jealous he asked because while percy was my best friend and i was one of his the truth is you were a better best friend for him why come on i was forced to be a sort of tomboy and i wasntgood at it no you weren t i smiled a little i tried we didntcare that you were a girl no but i did but it was more than that you two used to be you used to be like fred and george joan and tara ron weasley and harry potter i was jealous because you were his best friend except for dan and i wasn t if things hadntturned out the way the did it wouldntbe like that now he said i looked back at him who to say how things would have turned out things didntturn out so badly did they he asked i faced forward again to watch where i was going i dontknow i dontknow how badly things would have turned out i said showing too much emotion percy will get used to having a girlfriend and will no i dontthink so but before this year before penelope he asked i dontknow i said bad stuff has happened i was happy for a while i think you think yeah i think i was but you dontknow bad stuff happened i repeated we kept walking carefully so we d keep going in the same direction i sorry wood said eventually you donthave anything to apologize to me for percy is no i do owe you an apology for what i said earlier to blame you for everything was unfair and incorrect not completely unfair no not completely it was partially your fault but not completely i said no ok thank you he paused for a few minutes as we kept walking out of the forest when you said that bad things happened did you mean dan partially i said he stopped walking and i turned to see why i sorry about dan i wanted to tell percy and you that but i understand thanks i got to know him in quidditch after the fight well he tried to talk me down if i would have listened he wouldnthave died i said quietly what wood asked nothing never mind i said starting to walk again no i heard you i just didntunderstand wood said starting to follow what do you mean he wouldnthave died if i would have listened to him i didntmean anything who to say what would have happened had anything changed i said speeding up no what do you mean wood caught up and walked in front of me just drop it wood i can t fine pester me until we die in here i dontcare laura what did you mean please drop it it doesntmatter he died and there is nothing we can do about it why worry over things that may have changed the past i said walking past him he grabbed my arm you cannot just tell me that it is my fault that one of my friends died and drop it you can t it not your fault it mine i said angrily realizing what i said i shook my head fiercely i cantblame myself it was no one fault what do you mean wood asked i dontwant to talk about it i need you to talk about it and i need you to drop it damn it this is more important than our stupid grudges against each other then why cantyou let it go i asked you haven t and i never will and you wonteither if it is my fault then oh my g shut up i said it is not your fault and just forget about it oliver please he opened his mouth to argue then stopped he raised his pointer finger to his mouth and turned his head a little i heard a little rustle from not far away he must have heard it too we looked at each other for a second turned towards the edge of the forest and ran like hell cantyou run any faster wood asked right on my heels if i could dontyou think i would i panted if you want to go faster then pass me i cantjust leave you out here why not i asked i would leave you no you wouldn t he said but if you cantrun any faster there the edge i interrupted gaining a tiny bit of speed the two of us broke out of the forbidden forest but didntstop running after we were a few hundred feet from the edge we slowed down to stop we turned to face the forest what do you think it was i asked i not sure it was big though he said breathing deeply but not gasping for air like i was yeah i agreed vampire we werentthat deep into the forest not to mention a vampire would have attacked before we heard it i heard a rumor about giant spiders giant spiders i asked yeah give me a break i said maybe it was a centaur maybe wait something coming out of the woods we stood completely still watching the shape become clearer until hagrid i asked smiling a little we ran from hagrid how embarrassing what kind of gryffindors are we wood asked seriously i shrugged there are different types of bravery i guess some people can face death some people can face life wood nodded and which one can we face again i think it fair to say that we cantface death i said laughing slightly but how are we at facing life he asked maybe speaking to himself more than to me i looked up at him and for the first time in five years or more i tried to see him nobody perfect i said finally he laughed after all of the shit we ve put ourselves through i think we ve done a decent job at facing life maybe wood listen dan tried to talk me down too a few weeks before he died we got into a big argument over why the two of us hate each other i didntlisten either what did dan say wood asked he seemed to really care which i found surprising though i shouldnthave dan had been nice to oliver when the rest of the weasleys were turning everyone else against oliver for a month or so he said that we hated each other because we thought we had to he said that maybe we did have to for some reason what did he mean by that i not quite sure but dan did think that everything happened for a reason what reason could there be for the three of us making each other miserable or for dan dying so young for that matter i looked down and decided to ignore the latter part maybe if we were all still friends i would have tried to fly a broom again and actually hit the owlery i tried to joke he didntlaugh i dontknow if i even believe that everything happens for a reason when you said that it was my fault i never meant it i wasntprepared for the subject and i never would have said it had i been thinking not even to you a lot of things could have changed what happened that morning but you werentone of them you were there werentyou i dontwant to talk about this anymore i said trying to smile so he wouldnttake it personally he looked away did things turn out all right for you overall i asked after a minute he thought for a second and nodded they turned out all right he said looking back in my direction i smiled i glad i wish we would have talked years ago it would have made it easier for us to just forgive each other then probably we d have been friends within a week if we d have made better decisions probably wood said again more slowly and what the difference between a week and a few years i asked half seriously about five years minus one week wood answered i sighed you dontunderstand i said mainly to myself understand what i dontknow i said he shook his head and started walking towards the castle it late we probably missed lunch you dontunderstand that we ve fought for years over nothing i said quickly i walked to catch up with him and he stopped begrudgingly you dontunderstand that i am sorry for what happened but that i cantchange it you dontunderstand that i need your forgiveness right now i knew i should shut up but i couldn t you dontunderstand that we could still have been friends if the fight hadnthappened but more than that we could still be friends despite the fight you said you were completely alone after the fight that me now oliver except i donteven have quidditch if you wanted me to pay i have i am he started walking again that it no response none i hurried to catch up again i thought you could face life right now i part of what life is throwing at you and i plan on dodging it so it wonthit me he said coldly it going to hit you all right i muttered and getting in his path he tried to get past me but i countered all of his attempts what wood asked eventually giving up i not that easy to dodge am i no and it quite annoying that life do you think if you just ignore me that i ll go away i was hoping so yes wood said the same cold apathetic hatred that he usually directed at me was back i still knew enough about him to know that any further conversation was pointless i looked up at him and nodded ok i said quietly i turned my back on him and walked back to the castle using all of my self control not to cry or get noticeably angry author note so that was chapter two upset because the fight was over something so stupid so are the characters think the fight is the only reason that everyone is holding a grudge not entirely again there was no real cliffhanger so we ll put it down here coming up in chapter three what will happen when percy finally hears what the fight was all about and who will take the initiative in starting to repair the damage p s i proofread these things a few times but some errors are sure to escape my detection see an error that really bugs you let me know and i can fix it thanks chapter 3 rows and reconciliations after releasing some fury by stomping up to the gryffindor common room after making sure wood had not followed me inside i released some more fury by stomping through the common room and up to my dormitory joan was digging through her trunk she looked up and smiled hi hi i responded flatly she frowned something wrong did you really think that one afternoon of trying to find bizarre plants in the forbidden forest would make a difference i asked angrily dropping down onto my bed you know i set you up it was pretty easy to figure it out i sorry i thought maybe if you just yelled at each other for a while then you d get it out of your systems there more to it than that i picked up my pillow and threw it across the room at the closed door it him that the problem oh i practically begged him to forgive and forget i closed my eyes god what was i thinking and you know it not the forgive part that his problem or mine we cantforget we cantforget every single little thing that we did to each other for five years maybe with some time it wontmatter i have one more memory to add to the list now i spat i sorry laura and it never been about wood and i percy and wood are the ones who really need to yell at each other and they ll never forgive each other how do you know because percy still holds a grudge against me for accidentally hexing him in charms during our third year he never forgets anything and he rarely forgives anyone oliver holds grudges too joan said obviously i muttered still what harm would there be in making it so they had to talk about what happened during second year joan asked smiling slightly i sat up quickly you just dontlearn do you i asked no joan said and if the three of you joan stop i dontknow why you care all of a sudden but you re making everything worse she looked a little hurt but i wasntin a very sympathetic mood the whole thing is so stupid and you re miserable because of it she said i not miserable i said wondering if it was the truth she nodded and i could tell she thought i was lying would you like to come downstairs with me no i have some homework there nothing oliver can do but that would be letting him win i interrupted she laughed i can talk to him if you want i d rather you didn t i said as seriously as i could she nodded then i won t but think about having percy and oliver talk to each other i will i lied quickly so i could have the room to myself she left and i took my transfiguration book out of my book bag to try to find a way out of failing the project mcgonagall had assigned wendy lowe letter to adam fell into my lap i picked it up groaned and placed it on my nightstand i looked up some plants from the transfiguration book in my herbology book and marked them so i d be able to get those plants the next day i kept looking at the letter on the nightstand oh hell i said to myself after a couple of hours picking the letter up and standing i just have to hand it to adam and walk away no talking no yelling i walked downstairs and looked over to the seventh years area of the common room they were all gathered in their tight group i walked over to the group and handed adam the letter he took it looking questionably at me wendy i said pretending to whisper but making sure all of them heard me he nodded and tucked it in his cloak while the rest of the seventh years laughed where oliver mark asked i looked at him what do you mean i d been expecting wood to be there and didnteven notice that he wasn t you didntkill him did you cedar asked smiling i furrowed up my brow slightly he didntcome back in we haventseen him we assumed he was just pissed off at you and wasntcoming into the common room in case you were in here adam said he probably in the quidditch stadium i said shrugging i haventseen him since i came inside you didntcome inside together no we re not supposed to be outside after dark alone because of black tara said looking worried i looked out of the window and realized that i must have spent more time on transfiguration than i d though when dinner i asked about a quarter past an hour ago adam said she obviously cares deeply about where he is have any of you checked the quidditch stadium i asked no they all said why dontyou you left him out there alone rose said he wouldnthave come inside with me if i d threatened him with all three unforgivable curses i snapped joan stood up i going to find him good luck with that i said turning to go back upstairs who going to go with me i cantgo out there alone she said no one said anything what kind of friends are you i asked turning back towards the people still sitting look who talking mark muttered i ignored him well i asked them they all just looked back up at me i sighed i sure he fine but looking over at joan i was pretty sure that wasntgoing to do mark go check the owlery tara go with adam to check places like bathroom classrooms the kitchens etc cedar and rose stay here in case he comes back i ll go with joan to check the great hall and then the quidditch stadium tara stood up to head off but the boys just looked at me why should we listen to you adam asked because i worried about him ok now go joan said they all stood up and we walked out of the common room we split up to check our assigned areas when joan and i were about halfway to the marble staircase percy came into sight he was walking slowly back to the common room come with us i said once we were close enough to talk in normal voices why percy asked turning and following the two of us something wrong joan seems to think so i said oliver missing she said so percy asked so we re seeing if he in the quidditch stadium joan said why are you going laura percy asked because everyone else has other places to check i said simply we checked the great hall to find it empty so we headed outside and towards the stadium what happened this afternoon percy asked put wood in his place if his place was in the lake maybe i said blandly percy laughed did you even talk a little i said i d say there was more yelling than talking good for you thanks for your support i muttered i thought you d enjoy a good opportunity to yell at him percy said so did i and you didn t no look let just make sure he not dead and then i can finish my homework fine not that i care if he alive or not but i dontwant you two to get in trouble for leaving the building alone you want the three of us to get into trouble joan asked i can get us out of a detention if it comes down to that i rolled my eyes but didntrespond we walked silently through the dark our hands positioned just above our wands i was relieved to reach the quidditch stadium i am comfortable enough with who i am to admit that i am scared of the dark especially out in the open with a serial murderer on the loose so just having walls around me made me feel better i dontsee him percy said we re barely inside yet joan snapped as we kept walking when we reached the center of the field she said i dontsee him too bad percy said his voice dripping with sarcasm maybe he in the locker room i said walking towards the far wall joan followed me and percy who was muttering about the cold followed her we walked through an archway that led to the locker rooms and as none of us had been back there we stopped which one is gryffindor s i asked they arentmarked percy said he took his wand out lumos he shined his wand on the four doors in the area there were no markings of any kind to say if they were even locker rooms we can always just look in each one joan said how are we to know one of those rooms doesntcontain every bludger gone bad in hogwarts history percy asked plus the other houses wouldnttake kindly to us snooping around their locker rooms how else will we know if he in one of the rooms joan asked one of the doors opened allowing some light to come out for a few moments before it was closed again and there were four people standing in the little passageway percy cast his light on the figure immediately i was looking forward to looking in the rooms too i said the fourth person lit up his wand and cast it on all of us i thought you were going to leave me alone wood said eventually keeping his wand fixed on me we didntknow where you were we wanted to make sure you were all right joan said she lit her wand as well and there was enough light for all of us to see each other they drug me out here percy said emotionlessly they shouldnthave wood said joan was looking at me fixedly i cocked my head a little and she smiled slightly again i shook my head as much as i could without it being noticeable but she ignored me laura wanted you both to hear something she said my jaw dropped a little i don t you do she said no then i ll tell them tell them what i interrupted what are you two carrying on about percy asked i looked at him and frowned nothing nothing joan asked if anything it should be those two that have something to say to each other i said trying to get out of that situation but making things worse forget it wood said there nothing to say what percy asked they want us to try to solve our problems to shake hands and make up wood said angrily why would they want that percy asked looking at me i looked back at him wood thought you stole his broom that why he told everyone what he did it was all just a misunderstanding you thought i stole your damn broom that piece of shit wasntworth stealing percy said turning on wood if you hadntbeen jealous of me i wouldn t jealous of you why would i be jealous of you percy asked because i was the one succeeding and and i was well on my way to become a prefect would you let me finish one though you big headed back stabbing oaf if you had a halfway intelligent thought to finish i wouldnthave to interrupt you you bone headed back stabbing me first moronic dope you stole my can we please get past that broom i interrupted if he just would have told me he was taking it it was going to be a surprise percy said why wood asked why would you want to surprise me because i wanted you to make the team i didntneed a better broom i was trying to be nice you didnthave to be nice wood yelled this argument is so stupid i yelled percy and wood looked at me would you two just forgive each other why should i forgive him percy snapped because she wants a friend wood said what percy asked me she practically begged me to be her friend this afternoon wood said it you wouldnthave ditched her shut up i interrupted i shook my head at him screw you wood it not the truth he asked laura percy asked i looked at him screw you too percy you know what i dontcare if you blame me for what happened wood and i dontcare if you never talk to me again percy go ahead and move into ravenclaw with penelope for all i care you think i failed you wood no you both failed me you failed me and you failed each other and who pays for it me me wood gets quidditch and percy gets head boy and a girlfriend what do i get left behind this argument is your problem now i dontwant it and i dontwant anything to do with either of you no one said anything for a few seconds i shook my head and turned to leave laura percy started it my turn to ditch you now percy i snapped walking away from them joan hurried to catch up laura no how do you know what i no i just wanted to say i was sorry for you just couldntlet it go could you why did you have to get involved yesterday i at least had percy as a friend in name and i wasntfighting with wood i never asked for you to butt into my business i said brushing tears off of my cheeks i know i thought i could help i thought if you all knew the truth about what happened during your second year that that it would erase everything we ve done to each other in the five years since then i asked i never meant to make things worse joan said wiping her own eyes why did you even care i asked i dontknow she sighed i just do care i canthelp it she finished angrily i sighed too i know i said bitterly luckily for you i donthave enough anger left to be mad at you for trying to help i wiped my eyes again really she asked dontmake me question it i said ok she said quickly i laughed a little despite myself we walked out of the quidditch stadium and started heading towards the castle we could clearly hear wood and percy yelling at each other but i was tired of listening to them and their words brushed right over me maybe you gave up too quickly she said i snorted they gave up not me wood gave up five years ago percy gave up last year and now it my turn you didntgive either one of them a second chance though joan said i giving myself a second chance i want to have friends i want to be happy for the first time in five years you seemed happy before it was always about percy and wood i said just ranting now always even when percy was off with penelope it was still about percy and wood joan didntanswer maybe she was finally afraid to try to help anymore by the time we got back to the common room i d stopped crying the rest of the seventh years were back and looked up at us nervously where oliver tara asked the quidditch stadium you left him again cedar asked yes i said simply there was a little pause well is he ok tara asked i thought a second hard to say really we left him with percy so i dontthink they d kill each other they may put each other in the hospital wing but what percy doing there rose asked he came with us joan said another small pause to make sure wood was ok mark asked skeptically hard to say really look i going upstairs to finish the homework i should have done by now have a nice night i said leaving before anyone could ask any more questions if joan told them exactly what happened i didntcare i just didntcare anymore i woke up the next morning and realizing that i was still alive and that it was the start of another miserable day i groaned and drug myself out of bed and into the shower all of the gryffindor girls shared a bathroom you got used to it after a while after i got dressed quickly in the shower stall i stepped out and walked over to the sinks where there were girls lined up brushing their teeth and performing charms on the rest of their faces to try to improve their appearances i wasntmuch of a makeup person and barely made any attempt to make my hair look nice either hey i looked in the mirror at the girl next to me and attempted to smile hi ginny you look nice today she said i looked in the mirror the truth was that i looked tired and pathetic really thanks i said anyway how are you she asked looking at me instead of my reflection i thought about this for a few seconds not sure to be honest you oh i all right i guess still in love with potter i asked she looked down into the sink and spat i sighed i sorry just because i in a bad mood doesntgive me any right to it ok she interrupted i smiled at her reflection as i turned the faucet and put my toothbrush under the running water i heard about what happened last night in the quidditch stadium i didntexpect any differently i said percy getting out of the hospital wing tomorrow wood getting out not long after that she said i turned and mumbled wha with a toothbrush in your mouth it hard to enunciate she smiled i kidding but you cared you cared about what happened to them i kept brushing my teeth and turned my attention back to the mirror ginny looked down into the sink again i dontblame you for what you did huh percy deserved to hear the truth i rinsed out my toothbrush and put it back in my little bag i still dontquite understand that he was never a good friend ginny said you were there for him through it all but he never really was there for you especially during the past few months i played with the zipper on the bag for a minute before answering he was a good friend ginny i know that you look at him as being boring and strict but there more to him than what meets the eye his ambitions interfere with his judgment sometimes but his ambitions also make him a good influence ginny laughed a good influence well i cantargue with that still a good influence boring i laughed you brother has lost a lot he gave up on this part of his life and made his future everything you mean he lost dan ginny asked i nodded we all lost dan she said softly i nodded again but we didntturn out like percy you re being pretty hard on him he lost two best friends in a few years then there the stress of being a prefect and head boy ginny laughed stress he loves it i laughed too ok how about the stress of having two brothers who are trying to bring armageddon to hogwarts a little early a brother who best friends with you know who most wanted and a little sister who already had one too many encounters with the dark arts she didntanswer add that to the stress of being in a big family i get your point she said we walked out of the bathroom and down into the common room together laura if you think so highly of him then why dontyou want to be his friend ginny asked i looked at her she was only twelve but i never really saw her as being a lot younger than me maybe because i acted twelve most of the time because everything you said is true to a point too i said laughing a little she nodded spotted some friends and walked away i sat down in a big chair near the fire i usually got ready for school about an hour before i went down to breakfast so there wouldntbe a crowd in the bathroom it gave me time to finish homework and wake up before classes potions was awful but i wasntexpecting a picnic charms went fine i liked charms i was good at them after class i went up to my bedroom to get the containers for transfiguration and headed for the grounds wood headed me off at the entrance let me help i frowned and walked around him out of the common room you cantdo the project alone he said following me no i turned around here i said handing him half of the bags what do you want me to get if it in the forbidden forest then you can get it we ll forget about the caves look i went through this stuff last night and i think we can get enough plants on the regular grounds without going into i know that i held up my herbology book i ve got all of the plants we need marked in this he smiled a little i kept frowning let just get the damn plants then you can go right back to pretending that i dontexist ok wood said starting to walk down the hallway fine i said following we walked out of the castle and started making our way around it to the back did you enjoy making your little spectacle last night wood asked my face had to have clearly shown my disgust you know what i did it about damn time you two realized that you werentonly affecting each other by hating each other and you think you re completely blameless no but i a hell of a lot less to blame than you two maybe that true but do you think you can just declare yourself out of this whole thing you think this is just a game that you can stand up and quit i not quitting wood percy and you quit i cleaning up the game and putting it back into the closet i was the last one who tried to play the game life isnta game it is anything where people play to win is a game i lost one game and i not setting myself up for another loss you think you were the only one to lose that game you two turned out all right in the end that winning no it isn t then what is it it not a game it life you re the one who said you have to face it but you wanted it to go away you wanted me to just go away so i agreed to it last night i was doing joan a favor that it after this project i plan on leaving you alone and percy and percy and who will be your friends then there are only a few more months left of school after that i can start over wizards make their friends for life in hogwarts then i ll go back to the muggle world and just turn your back on turn my back on the world that turned its back on my first i turned to face him what do you care why cantyou leave me alone isntthat only fair you werentthere after you left last night no kidding there a profound statement you never told percy how you felt you expected him to read your mind and he should have known that he ditched me it doesnttake a rocket scientist and he was too preoccupied to try to read your mind wood continued penelope was the first good thing to come around in years when percy ditched you it came slowly you had time to adapt what you did to him last night was sudden and unexpected how would you react why do you care since when do you stand up for percy wood ignored me how would you react if your best friend said she never wanted anything to do with you ever again out of no where i didntrespond i bent over and pulled up a flower i recognized from the herbology book and stuffed it into a bag do you end a friendship over one thing you did i spat looking up at him you ended two dontend three he looked me in the eyes i looked away from him i ve never been a good friend i ve tried god knows i have tried but i always end up you cantchange what happened during our second year but it not too late to change what happened last night i looked up at him again why are you trying to help me he frowned a little more and shrugged he pulled some of the last leaves left on a tree we were walking under and put them into one of the bags i d given him you dontjust grow a conscious overnight i ve always had a conscious i just decided to apply it to you today dontexpect it to become a habit i smiled slightly did percy get to you no yeah right i wasntthere after i left that what you said he didntmake you cry or anything did no because i would have stuck around if there was going to be a cry fest there wasntany bloody crying no i ll have to try a little harder next time then like you could make us cry he said i shrugged and looked down i wouldntbe so sure oliver oliver whenever you say my name it means you really mean it i do mean it dan he asked quietly you may not be my favorite person but i dontwant to make you cry i said dodging the subject why not i would think it would give you some pleasure you want to make me cry no see i asked you re rather ugly when you cry i faked a smile and nodded you re funny he laughed i kidding and that makes it nicer i sorry i doubt that are you going to patch things up with percy or not of course i said after a few seconds thanks oliver i mean wood let get some plants i nodded we worked on the project for about an hour before it started getting dark we decided that by the time we walked back to the castle we wouldntbe able to identify an oak from a pine tree and that we had enough plants to pass the project at least thank you for pointing out to me that gryffindor can still win the cup wood said out of no where about halfway back to the castle what brought that up me i smiled i want gryffindor to win as just as much as the next guy who in gryffindor even if i do think that quidditch and all other sports are pointless it not pointless no give me one reason hogwarts should have such a dangerous pastime things are dangerous enough in this world azkaban canteven keep us safe hogwarts has quidditch to give people like me something to be it lets people like me succeed you re a good enough wizard but that doesntmake you well known quidditch makes me someone well i never hated you for quidditch so that must not be who you are thanks a lot you re welcome anyway thank you for supporting gryffindor then you re welcome i said more sincerely after a minute i added that why you told me to make up with percy isntit to be even yeah i looked down partially because it was getting pretty dark out and i couldntsee very much of the ground in front of me lumos wood lit his wand and we walked the rest of the way back to the castle in silence after we got inside i went straight to the great hall percy was sitting at the end of the table alone i walked over and sat down next to him hi percy didntacknowledge my presence percy i sorry for saying that i didntwant anything to do with you i didntmean it i was only angry jealous of penelope percy asked coolly i trying to apologize he looked at me i guess in some ways i was jealous of penelope my best friend suddenly ditches me for some girl percy you re angry and i understand that but you hurt me you ditched me he didntsay anything and looked down at his plate i want to be your friend but you have to be a friend girlfriends will come and go and as your best friend i ll probably hate all of them because they take some of our time away from me but for them to take all of our time away from me is not fair i didnteven notice that you were hurt i didntwant you to notice i didntwant to say anything but last night i was so tired of everything you should have said something sooner percy said i know i sorry i smiled i know you are will that matter i still want to spend time with penelope and i still want you to spend time with her i just want a friend again percy he nodded and i smiled a little more so do you love her or what i asked he laughed that s possible i smiled does she love you i think so good but percy yes just dontforget that i love you too just differently he looked at me and smiled blushing a little same here what afraid to say it yes i laughed i glad we talked me too how are bill and charlie alive i dontreally know other than that he said and your parents happy they like it when we go off to school and you i good you he asked i good too now author note once again no cliffhanger the truth is that i hate cliffhangers they just are not natural places for a chapter break think of this story as being on the sitcom schedule each chapter is a small piece of the plot with its own small problem but the problem comes to some sense of closure at the end so i guess the final author note in each chapter is like the previews for the next episode next week on do be my enemy for friendship sake that would make a kick ass soap opera title while laura relationship with percy remains the same her relationship with the rest of the seventh years starts changing p s please review i cantmake this story better without feedback author note this chapter is kind of a transition chapter it mainly a few conversations for the purpose of showing relationships changing better than a paragraph about time passing and things changing could chapter 4 fears of fate a week or so passed wood and i passed our transfiguration project with an eighty percent percy and i spent some time hanging out penelope was there about half of the time it was better than before but i felt awkward and unwanted still i was happier and over the next few weeks i gradually stopped visiting penelope with percy and percy was gone more it still wasntlike before percy made more of an effort not to forget about me but it hurt that he had to make an effort i was walking down the hallway one friday heading out to the lake even though it was cold when i heard my name being called i turned to see wood walking towards me something wrong i asked after he caught up i kept walking towards the front doors and he followed no you made up with percy so you dontowe me anything for telling you that stuff about the cup if anything i owe you ok actually that what i wanted to talk to you about no kidding he ignored my sarcasm you dontowe me anything for anything i looked at him suspiciously why not because i dontowe you anything ok why did you want to talk to me again look do you want to go to hogsmeade with us seventh years tomorrow or not i didntanswer we had reached the oak doors and i turned to face wood the girls want you to come with us and i was nominated to ask the suspicion on my face showed even more are you coming with us he asked impatiently sure thank you i said slowly he nodded and walked off down another corridor i went to the lake and sat down on a big rock beside it i liked to look out over the ice in the winter we were forbidden to walk on it because in a magical lake the ice is sometimes only an illusion and it impossible to tell if it is or not without sending someone out onto it ey laura i turned to see hagrid carrying two large bags of something i stood hi hagrid need some help no i ve got this could ya come with me t open a door though of course i said following him i noticed you an percy ave been together more yes a little hey i ve heard from some people that you took my advice on teaching the older students with some pretty cool creatures the younger students arentas happy the younger students need a little trainin perhaps you re right course i am i a professor i smiled that you are professor hagrid he chuckled just call me agrid i don need a title t impress anyone you have a wonderful personality for that eh i teased he laughed again i couldnt elp but notice yeh was spending more time with oliver wood i blew some air out of my nose through matters out of my hands ne ertheless yer both still alive more than most folks would ve expected hagrid do you hate anyone that you really dontknow why you hate them you just do because you always have hagrid thought for a few seconds i donthate many people no but have you ever sure i ve never been extremely fond of filch you have a reason for that though i said smiling up at him why do yeh ask it not like you can just stop hating someone though even if the reasons for hating them have gone away why not because it only fair if i hate him back yeh wouldn be talkin bout wood now would ya i speaking hypothetically oh right and if this hypothetically speaking person just so happens to answer to the name wood so be it i added ere we are just open this ere door please hagrid said as were were standing in front of a shed near the greenhouses i did and stepped back so that hagrid could get in easily he placed the bags down and walked back outside brushing his hands together thanks hagrid said welcome he looked down at me hitting me with a more piercing look than i d have thought his kind eyes could muster he put a hand on my shoulder gently and pushed me slightly so i d start walking with him one o the biggest debates in the wizardin world is on whether er not people are subject to fate er destiny many a duel was started cause of it personally i a little on both sides what do you mean well people cantcontrol things all that well if yeh were t just look at th surface o people then yeh d have no problems believin that they were bein guided by some sort o force but then i see people do great kind things and i see people do terrible things couldntthat be fate no laura people make decisions t do great or terrible things people make choices an nothin but those people controls em control yer own destiny that what me dad used t say do ya understand i think so but i not sure what point is supposed to be coming out of the lesson fate is just what people call it when there isn an explanation for it why did i have to get kicked out o ogwarts why did i have to find aragog fate see yes but again why are you telling me this all i sayin is that yeh canthelp what brought about yer hate fer this hypothetical oliver wood that fate but yeh do have a decision t make i didntanswer hate a mighty strong emotion laura do yeh really hate im i disliked him pretty strongly yeh can get past that ya look cold go on back inside now thanks again hagrid said walking away i watched his back for a minute before taking his advice and going inside i knew hagrid had been through a lot especially during what should have been his hogwarts years hagrid knew what hate was hagrid knew a lot despite being kicked out of school maybe that why new knew so much the next day i woke up early as i had no idea what time wood and company wanted to leave it was the hogsmeade visit before christmas so it was bound to be crowded in every store i put on some warm clothes and went down to the common room about an hour later the rest of the seventh years minus percy were ready to head out we re glad you could go joan said as we walked out of the common room thanks for having wood ask me i answered smiling she cocked her head a little but didntsay anything the eight of us left hogwarts ground and again away from the eyes and ears of hogwarts we could be ourselves the boys walked faster and once they were out of hearing distance the conversations i almost never got to be a part of began what would you want for christmas if you were a seventh year slytherin rose asked brains cedar asked all of us except rose laughed she was stalking flint who like a good slytherin wanted nothing to do with a gryffindor no matter what she looked like or how pure her blood was poor cedric tara said dumped for a slytherin he was never my type no i asked no quidditch players too caught up in other things i need more attention rose said smiling broadly flint slytherin quidditch captain joan said yes but the slytherins are smart enough to just cheat it cuts down on so much practice the rest of us shook our heads remembering all too clearly the years we d watched gryffindor fall to slytherin pathetic cheating we ve got a good team this year we re sure to win cedar said we ve lost a game joan said we can still win wood will be sure of it rose groaned he obsessed poor guy it important to him joan said important and everything are two different things rose countered not always i said they all looked at me waiting i shrugged they re not always different when they kept staring i asked what did she stand up for oliver cedar asked no i said it debatable tara said she could have been standing up for someone else yes i agreed who rose and cedar asked i laughed anyone else in general i dontknow we werentsure you d want to come with us with oliver coming perhaps there still a reason for us believing that cedar said i shrugged he seemed sincere huh joan asked when he asked if i wanted to come along he said you wanted him to ask i dontneed him to say it ok you know the four of them were looking at each other what joan looked at me then away we didntthink you d want to go with him so we didntwant to ask because we didntwant to make you feel bad about saying no i didntsay anything for a few seconds before laughing quietly oh come off of it like wood would ask me to come along just just nothing he wouldn t which is why we re so confused tara said my smile started to vanish well you really didnttell him to ask me they shook their heads maybe i should head back something smells funny they nodded i laughed at their faces which hadntlooked that confused since snape hadntgiven homework during our third year i was kidding i think just if he pulls his wand on me we could easily take the guys that for sure cedar said puffing out her chest slightly bunch of girly girls not an arnold joke written before that i am almost positive we all laughed and they forgot about it i was too busy thinking about whether i should be watching my back or not to really get into any of the conversations on the rest of the way to hogsmeade we five girls caught up with the boys in zonko s i was never really into pranks but i enjoyed looking at the joke shop selection i was particularly amused by people around the store suddenly turning into canaries although i couldntfind the product that caused it anywhere i needed to get a present for percy and i got him a book on the ministry i got a book about muggle animals for hagrid as he always turned up when i needed someone to talk to and while technically it was illegal for me to give magical gifts to my muggle family i did get my parents some magical candy that they could eat when i came home for the holidays the eight of us spent most of the day just walking from shop to shop there were dozens my favorite was a little shop that sold enchanted dust collectors muggle dust collectors are the stupid ornamental things that sit on shelves and desks for years untouched and rarely looked at their one function is to collect dust wizarding dust collectors are ornamental things that sit on shelves and desks for years untouched and rarely looked at as well except these literally collect dust and save a lot of time that would be spent dusting surfaces the other seventh years each got their mothers one we were all exhausted by the time we decided to go back to hogwarts the guys decided they d walk us back i was listening to the rest of them sing professional quidditch teams songs i d never been to any professional quidditch matches to hear any of them but they were all hilarious the whinging weasels song ginny i interrupted i stopped in place i forgot to get ginny weasley a present you get all of the weasleys gifts mark asked no i ve gotten ginny a gift every year for the past six years she the only girl and well her brothers have no idea what she would want so i ve always gotten her something she used to be like my little sister over summer vacations i have to go back i said turning around we have to be back in an hour joan said i paused and shook my head it wonttake me long if i go back now i ll have twenty minutes to get something for her i ll see you back at the castle i turned and started walking quickly back to the wizarding town after a few minutes i heard footsteps right behind me i turned my head still walking to see wood catching up to me i need to get hagrid something he said quickly i slowed down so he d catch up more quickly i didntknow you were friends with hagrid oliver laughed under his breath slightly but there wasntany humor in it hagrid befriends people who need him he took me under his wing my second year i looked at wood but i wasntlooking at him i d never thought about it before i knew hagrid had befriended more students but you never saw him with any of them hagrid had started talking to me the year before when percy had really started seeing penelope all of the time the thing is that once he makes a friend he never loses one so hagrid makes a lot of christmas presents i kept walking in silence for a few minutes i didntlike the thought of people feeling sorry for me espeically not hagrid still i talked to hagrid yesterday i said i did too wood said he was still walking quickly it wasnteasy to keep up but for some reason i didntwant him to leave me behind can you slow down a little i asked why because i want to talk to you but you re walking so fast i have to use my breath to keep up i said he didntsay anything but he did slow down enough that i could ease the pain i was starting to feel in my stomach from getting more exercise than i was used to we talked about you i said quickly not looking at him me yes what about me i thought for a minute deciding how to put what i wanted to say in the least amount of words possible because i didntreally want to be the one to say them i forgot why i hated you well forgot is the wrong word finding out why you did what you did five years ago it was a stupid misunderstanding hagrid known the whole story longer than we have yeah that was just starting to dawn on me we didnttalk about what happened five years ago no you donthate me anyone and want to be friends right the way he put it made me immediately go into my defensive state i may not hate you but that doesntmake me want to be your friend i snapped why he asked you think because you re the quidditch captain and good looking everyone wants to be your friend i asked he blushed slightly that not what i meant then what did you mean i meant why shouldntwe be friends if we donthate each other i what you werentthe only one to talk to hagrid yesterday i blinked shook my head stopped shook my head again because it didntwork the first time and repeated that process once more are you ok wood asked looking at me strangely being friends with you is too close to admitting that i was wrong and stupid before it the same thing see but i admitting the same thing come off it laura admit you were wrong and move on i not even sure what i admitting that i was wrong about for letting a misunderstanding come between a friendship i guilty of the same thing i looked at him carefully you re serious about this whole thing yes then i was wrong he smiled i was wrong too i didntsay anything the rest of the way to hogsmeade i wasntonly wrong five years ago i d been wrong about him longer than that we split up right away when we entered town i headed towards some of the more popular stores with twelve year old girls i mentally went through the gifts i d already gotten her when she was seven i got her a toy wand when she was eight she got a package of muggle makeup from me and when she was nine i got her a sweatshirt that had my friend went to hogwarts and all i got was this stupid jumper printed on it when she was ten i got her some potions materials which mrs weasley practically banned me from the burrow for and the last year i had gotten her some clothes a few were new but most of them were hand me downs from me and my older cousins i think that had been her favorite present from me but this year i was drawing a blank i d thought about it before but had always brushed it off when nothing came to me thinking i d have plenty of time to pick something out for her how could i have forgotten ginny i spent half of my twenty minutes in shops that i knew werentright i walked out of a large clothing store and across the street was a beaten worn down looking building i felt kind of sorry for it and walked over upon realizing it was a shop i walked in i couldntsee anyone in there but even had there been anyone it would have been difficult to find them it was a mirror shop i wandered around spellbound looking at my reflection in them in some i saw my reflection normally in others i looked slightly older slightly younger slightly happier slightly less happy and in some i didntsee my reflection at all but places or things when i saw a person in one i jumped back and almost knocked over a mirror i spun around in time to catch it and sighed in relief if you break a magical mirror you really do get seven years of bad luck in return good save i heard from behind me i turned again more carefully this time the old man i had seen in the mirror was standing there smiling kindly i sorry i said you scared me and it happens all of the time anyway all of our mirrors are breakproof and are under a lifetime warranty so if they do break your seven years of bad luck will gladly be taken from you and you will be given a refund he said i was still too unnerved to respond to what he was saying i looking for a present for a friend but i doubt that i could afford any magic mirror i didntknow this shop existed i just sort of was drawn to it some people are drawn to mirrors the old man said smiling i turned to him frowning i not shallow or magical mirrors darling the man interrupted quickly i was in no way trying to imply that you are narcissistic what did you mean then i asked more kindly i meant that mirrors call certain people i looked around the store not all magic mirrors are expensive the man said would you like to see some inexpensive ones i nodded looking in one mirror at my house sure the man started walking through the store with me right behind him a few times i stalled not sure which one was the man and which ones were merely his reflection and in a minute we reached a section with smaller mirrors have you found anything the man asked i opened my mouth to respond but another voice came first yes i believe i have said wood as he walked around a shelf of mirrors he stopped when he saw me good the man said smiling more genuinely now which one have you selected this one wood said holding up a round mirror that was about six inches in diameter ah yes that is a peculiar mirror indeed it shows creatures in it doesntit yes wood said looking into it do you think hagrid would like it laura i sure he d love it i said feeling stupid about my book for him oliver nodded i ll take it then the old man said thank you sir laura this area would be good for a gift for a young girl i ll be back in a few minutes donttouch the surface of any mirrors please ok i said as he walked away i realized that my time was ticking away and i was probably already going to be a little late but the mirrors were calling to me when he came back a few minutes later i had my mind made up i pointed and said that one is right it reflects people honestly the man said are you sure that would be right for your friend i looked closely at my own reflection it was reflecting me honestly i looked tired a little sad mainly passive yes she a good person and seeing that would make her feel better about herself i responded eventually it five galleons the man said that fine i said after a few seconds very well you must be a good friend pick it up by the frame and follow me please he said kindly i followed him to the back of the store where he had a small cash register of some sort he pressed a few keys and after taking my five galleons made the machine spit out a warranty certificate which he sighed and had me sign as well thank you miss he said handing me the mirror in a small box the mirror was only about four inches across but i knew ginny would love it i walked out of the store to find wood waiting for me at first i went into defense mode and then i remember he seemed to want to get along the defense mode too a back burner to my try to be nice mode we re going to be late he said simply starting to walk yeah well what can they do to us have you ever had a detention wood asked looking at me strangely i dontget caught much well then dontthink about what they can do to us it only kills your nerves he said calmly we re good kids we ll just have to explain that we lost track of time together i frowned a little we can say we just didntwant to walk alone after dark together he repeated together isntalone you dontquite understand do you realize how us getting along has never really occurred to people but the professors are people dumbledore isntgoing to be the one to give us detention mcgonagall will be i winced slightly well she thinks we hate each other so it not like she ll think we were getting into any trouble together unless we were trying to kill each other or something like that wood said i laughed a little we never hated each other that much how much time do we have left before curfew ten minutes and it will take us three times that long to get to hogwarts i said by foot wood said looking at me as we kept walking quickly i dontsee a train or car anywhere i said accio cleansweep seven oliver said after he d taken out his wand oh so i can get detention alone great wood i said a cleansweep can easily carry two people and the professors will love that us flying over land that isnthogwarts grounds we re going to have so many detentions if they dontexpel us relax we ll fly over the path down low no one will see us so no one will know except for the people who see your broom coming speaking of which i said oliver broom had come flying between two trees into his hand you can walk if you want wood said i stopped walking tapped my foot a few times sighed shook my head sighed again and said you re sure that can carry two people safely i didntsay safely wood said smiling are you kidding i asked quite seriously yes i assure you that i am perfectly capable of steering this thing now do you want to cheat a little and get out of a detention or not yes i said he climbed onto the broom and his feet brushing the ground flew over a few feet to where i was standing i swung my leg over the broom and sat down behind him you re either going to have to hang onto the broom or to me wood said after a minute i held onto the few inches separating the two of us wood kicked off and started flying he sped up slowly at first and then more quickly ok he asked after a few minutes this is a little awkward but i fine i answered he laughed dontlike flying no but that not what i was referring to i said i realized that laura nothing personal wood nodded he put on a sudden burst of speed i felt like i was falling off so i leaned forward to try to counter it automatically i let go of the broom with one hand and wrapped my arm around him he stopped accelerating quickly we were flying fairly fast but were only three feet off the ground i took my arm away and held onto the broom a little tighter with both hands you did that on purpose i said bitterly just wanted to show you what awkward was i told you not to take it personally but you meant it personally he said you dontfeel weird we barely get along there a difference between being friends and not hating each other you could try not being so obvious about that though wood said i didntanswer and wood started slowing down the broom we were about a minute run from the gates and neither one of us had any doubts that the dementors would consider a broom zipping past them to be suspicious we both hopped off of the broom and started running to the gates if we were inside of those before curfew we d be fine if we weren t we d have mcgonagall to deal with once we got within a few feet we saw professor flitwick standing there with a clipboard in his hands i felt a chill go up my back how was he standing so close to those dementors waiting for all of us i got my answer when he talked he breath smelled heavily of chocolate right on time he said looking up at us carefully we though we were going to be late wood said nicely i didntsay anything i was starting to feel funny and realized i hadntbrought a piece of chocolate with me why were you going to be late flitwick asked we got caught up in a store at the last minute i could hear wood saying although i was barely comprehending it laura professor flitwick asked no chocolate i whispered oh here here take this he said digging in his robe and pulling out a chocolate frog which he unwrapped for me i took it and ate it quickly i let a few chills run down my back before thanking him you re welcome that why i here of course he said you d better go back to the castle quickly wood and i hurried past the dementors once we stopped feeling their effects he looked over at me dementors affect you i shrugged slightly not terribly i usually just walk quickly past them and eat a bit of chocolate do you see things no hear things no remember things it hadntbeen a question so i felt no obligation to confirm what he had said i remember you and percy he said quietly i looked over at him frowning i thought dementors made people relive bad memories wood smiled a little that right i started to reach out to him but quickly changed my mind i sorry oliver he just shrugged again we kept walking without saying anything for about ten minutes what your favorite color wood asked suddenly why the silence is making me nervous he said about half kidding i rolled my eyes but answered anyway blue mine scarlet imagine that no it was even before quidditch i like it it a nice color i said nice pretty better your favorite number i dontknow three i guess i said why third time a charm three strikes you re out three what must be muggle sayings oh mine seven magical number seven i asked yes and seven players on a quidditch team i shook my head but smiled you re very predictable and you aren t no right ok then what my favorite food anything peppermint i said smirking how did you know that it always been your favorite food i ll bet your favorite food is peanut butter no pizza i said pizza it used to be peanut butter my favorite food was never peanut butter it was always pizza right ok so what my favorite season quidditch season i said laughing damn it trick question too what mine i asked spring good guess so you ve known one more thing about me than i have about you what my favorite song what is this a competition i asked yes wood said right away well that easy you said it was the song for that chinese quidditch team i dontknow yours i donthave one there are too many songs that i like to choose only one so you re still one up on me two one your answer for the song wasntreally an answer neither was quidditch season i two up what my favorite place place wood asked location how in the hell am i supposed to know guess then he thought for a few minutes here hogwarts right yours is hold on let me think after a few minutes i tried the obvious the quidditch stadium no it at home where do you live again guess wood mocked i cantremember you live in the suburbs of london to the northeast he said gloating now we re tied the contest kept going when we reached the school we were still tied although we d missed more questions than we d gotten right most of the rest of the correct answers were guesses ok last question wood said opening the oak door and letting me walk in first i get to choose what it is i said no i do what my worst fear i thought for a few seconds that you re gay what he asked closing the door rather strongly i laughed i kidding good you aren t are you no because you ve never had a girlfriend here quidditch is your girlfriend i asked laughing and starting up the marble staircase in front of him and you ve never had a boyfriend here he said i said i was only kidding good i thought for a few more seconds is it dying is what dying is dying your worst fear oh no it isn t what is it then failing he said seriously failing out of hogwarts i thought you were a decent student no failing in general everyone fails at something no one perfect i know that i more afraid of being a failure you wontbe you re going to win that quidditch cup this year remember there more to life than the cup i looked at him surprised he rolled his eyes place oliver wood is obsessed with quidditch joke here he said sarcastically i laughed i couldntcome up with one quickly enough we started walking up another staircase anyway if you set reasonable goals for yourself you wontfail neither will i you sound so sure and i am most of the time and the rest of the time the rest of the time i happy enough with the present not to worry about the future he nodded and didntsay anything for a while is your greatest fear death he asked finally it took me several seconds to realize that we were still playing that game no it isn t then what is it he asked after realizing i wasntgoing to say unless he specifically asked being alone forever i answered quickly looking down you re never alone there always someone there to be a friend or there family that not what i meant i said quietly oh oh right he said i looked over at him quickly to see that he was looking away i didntwant to make you uncomfortable or anything i said realizing that i was the one blushing you didn t i just worry about that too sometimes only sometimes yes i think there a person out there for everyone yeah that what i afraid of i answered partially to myself why i like the idea you do yeah why not he asked one person for everyone only one what are the odds of finding them well the perfect person would be within reach and if it didntwork out right then it wasntthe right person he said you really like the idea of only one person for everyone what did you think that all guys support polygamy or no that not what i meant what did you mean i just mean what if you were to find your soulmate when you were seventy i asked then we d have a good number or years left together what if you were one hundred at least i found her the amount of time isntthat important even if you only knew her for a few years months days even yes even though you d have the rest of your life to live alone i asked i thought i ve already spent one hundred years without her oh i forgot i said smiling despite myself i still dontunderstand why you re afraid i sighed i guess i just skeptical of things like this that rely so much on chance and can be ruined so easily i understand maybe we reached the common room and walked in together the seventh years looked over at us a little confused we thought you were going to be late adam said once we d walked over we came close oliver said laying his broom up against a chair which he sat down in find a gift joan asked looking up at me i nodded yes i think she ll love it i stood there looking back at them looking up at me may i sit down i asked finally they all nodded saying yeses sures and whatevers i stayed with them for a few hours talking about whatever the conversation led to and i had fun when percy came in i smiled at him but didntwalk over to greet him he looked at me strangely but not for long he went straight up to his dormitory what eating him mark asked he ll get over it i said maybe wood added only slightly under his breath i nodded once or twice and stood up slowly i getting tired too much shopping i ll see you all in the morning i said heading towards the door leading upstairs author note i made a sweatshirt that says my friend went to hogwarts and all i got was this stupid jumper after reading this story again a lot of this is already written i almost half way through what finished it a sweet jumper sweater i mean coming up in chapter 5 christmas vacation and an introduction to new year traditions in the wizarding world think food fireworks dancing andawesome muggle games i like the next chapter i canthelp it author note how embarrassing i found a discrepancy in my own story in chapter 1 i said that mark was tara boyfriend and adam was joan boyfriend that wasntright adam and tara have been dating for years mark and joan date on and off i just wanted to make that clear before this chapter starts because this is the first time where it actually matters i sorry for the mistake but i am going back to change it chapter 5 a new year several days passed i spent most of my time before christmas vacation studying for all of the exams the teachers were giving in the evenings i would sit with the seventh years wood and i were getting along fine of course he was practicing quidditch as much as i was studying there werentmany opportunities to fight the rest of the seventh years still couldntact like this wasntweird one night adam quit trying to act were you two abducted and switched bodies with some aliens adam liked muggle science fiction studies too much what are you talking about adam tara asked laura and wood i confused wood laughed maybe it a spell cedar said or even weirder than that rose said you mean like they just decided to get along cedar asked yeah something like that rose said or aliens it wasntaliens adam rose said how do you know he asked we could just ask them as they re sitting right here listening tara said right cedar said looking at me well who right you i said it a spell she asked looking surprised no we just decided to get along or try to get along i said oh well that less fun sorry wood said he stood up i ve got quidditch practice have a nice evening take it easy on them cedar said i would never do that he answered seriously but smiling he picked his cloak up off of the floor and walked out of the common room i easily passed the tests i studied so much for and before i knew it i was on the train heading back to london mum and dad were meeting me there and i would spend a little time as a muggle i was looking forward to seeing some of my muggle friends again laura i looked up i had been the only person in my compartment and had been liking it that way hey wood uh i know we haventbeen getting along very long or anything but my parents always have this big new year party a whole bunch of people will be there all of the seventh years and except percy i interrupted what oh yes not percy keep going if you want to come you re welcome to i looked out of the window after a minute wood asked if i d heard him or not i heard you i dontknow where you live oh just say frank and linda wood residence when you use floo powder he said our fireplace isntconnected to that i said simply why oh laura i sorry i forgot your parents are muggles i shrugged a little and looked back out the window but you live northeast of london right yes my aunt does too if you could get to her house go to a person house that i ve never met do you want to go he asked not rudely yes then we ll figure out a but i dontknow anything about wizards and witches really is it a formal party no not really i donteven know what a not really formal party is for wizards wear your cloak over some muggle clothes come with a dish or dessert just have fun he said smiling and i ll only know a few people there that not true you ll know several people from hogwarts and i started you have to be around wizards to understand them you ll have to join our world after hogwarts or abandon magic i thought about this and nodded you re right of course i am where does your aunt live we went on to plan how i could get to wood house i felt guilty like i was betraying percy but i did have a right to make my own friends wood ended up staying in my car for about half an hour talking about what to expect at the party he said there would be a lot of people but mainly adults so i wouldnthave to worry about being around everyone there would also be food and fireworks music and dancing but not much and it wasntobligatory he assured me and staying up into the twilight hours i never would have admitted it to him at the time but it sounded fun how will i get home i asked he shrugged maybe you can stay with joan or something i nodded maybe i dontreally know joan very well either he laughed you ve lived with joan for seven years what you mean is that you ve pretended that you didntknow her until recently pretty much yes i admitted i sure she d gladly let you stay with her for a few hours so you ll definitely come then i ll run it by my parents first but i will if i can you need a date what just kidding he said grinning oh you scared me for a minute scared myself for a minute come with me we ll talk to joan and joan enthusiastically agreed to let me stay with her until i had enough sleep to be able to drive home from wood aunt house which was only about half an hour away from my house if i was still angry at her at all and it was hard to be angry at joan for anything for butting into my life earlier in the school year i was completely over it then i spent the rest of the trip to london in the girls compartment my parents were waiting outside of platform 9 i hugged them and we walked out of king cross together talking about what had happened at school since i d last written to them they loved hearing about all of the crazy things that seemed to happen there in the car i brought up wood parents party and my parents were glad that i was making more friends and said that they didntcare if i went or not i got a little nervous then because the one excuse i had left was gone christmas was wonderful i got nice presents and my parents liked my gifts for them which i d gotten at a muggle store during the summer i even got to spend a little time with some of my muggle friends from primary school who thought i was going to a boarding school in america i did homework off and on and finished a few days before new year s i watched a lot of television i didntreally miss it while at hogwarts but i still enjoyed watching a few shows while at home new year eve came faster than i would have liked i was nervous about being around a bunch of people i didntknow well at all and then spending the night in an environment i was clueless about with a girl i was just becoming friends with i put on some nicer casual muggle clothes folded up my cloak and put it under the seat in my car i kissed mum and dad goodbye and started on the half an hour drive to wood aunt house he d written to her and i had called her to make sure it was all ok she seemed like a nice woman on the phone and wood assured me in a short letter that she was harmless i pulled into her driveway off to the side of the garage so people could still pull out and into it i grabbed my cloak and plate of a couple dozen homemade cookies and walked up to the front door a middle aged woman opened the door before i got a chance to knock or ring the doorbell she ushered me in quickly and shut the door sorry i didntwant the neighbors to get a glimpse of the house she laughed merrily i looked around me there was nothing particularly unusual about the small hallway i was in i could see a small living room at the end of it the only magical thing i noticed was a painting waving at me i heard a clicking noise and was shocked to see a bedside table walk out of a door leading into the hallway it hobbled into the living room and out of sight i watched it in shock after attending hogwarts for seven years i was used to weird things happening but this was leaving my comfort range oliver aunt laughed again pets living furniture makes things more interesting i nodded slowly looking back at her i remembered my manners and extended my hand a little slowly i laura debman thank you for letting me use your fireplace it my pleasure laura i harriet lanolin oliver favorite aunt he a good kid pride of the family we were all so disappointed when we heard gryffindor had lost that match against hufflepuff but he still got hope that gryffindor can still win i suppose it possible it possible he very motivated i said trying to be polite of course his father my brother was quidditch captain for gryffindor when he was in school and our father before that was as well we were afraid he wasntgoing to make the team but he surprised us all by making it his second year of course we were hoping for a better position than keeper i was frowning now i couldnthelp it i was shocked at how quickly quidditch had come up and how wood favorite aunt was talking about him it a good position important i said yes it better than beater i guess anyway we should leave for frank house now just let me grab my cloak out of the bedroom the fireplace is in the living room at the end of this hall she said pointing you can wait for me in there dear i forced a smile and nodded ok the last thing i wanted to do at the moment was wait in a room with living furniture whether the furniture was just charmed or alive i walked down there as slowly as i could without looking reluctant the fireplace was at the other side of the room from the door once at the doorway i watched a chair move halfway across the room to sit right in front of the hearth figures i muttered excuse me i spun around to see a man standing behind me he was frowning and had his arms crossed who are you i asked startled who are you he countered this is my house i let a small sigh of relief escape before extending my hand i sorry you startled me my name is laura debman i going to mr wood party with mrs lanolin oh ok i mr lanolin he said reluctantly taking my hand you re wo oliver uncle i said by marriage he responded looking over my head dontget that close to the fireplace you ll catch the whole house on fire he shouted he pushed past me stalked across the room and kicked the chain in one of its short wooden legs the chair practically flew to the center of the room i was watching my mouth open slightly ready to go mrs lanolin asked walking past me farther into the room i didntanswer thinking she was talking to her husband as she was walking in his direction and looking at him after about thirty second of standing at the hearth holding a pot of floo powder she raised her eyebrows laura she asked oh yes i ready i said hurrying across the room avoiding furniture the best that i could it wasnteasy as the furniture seemed to be crowding into this room there were about five chairs three tables and a china cabinet good i ll be back late dontwait up mrs lanolin said definitely to her husband this time he snorted softly and left the room quickly i must have looked confused because mrs lanolin explained quickly he a muggle doesntlike my family much says they re too unpredictable they think he boring cantsay i dontcompletely disagree with them sometimes he a good man though you go first she said pushing the floo powder at me i d used floo powder only once but i d read plenty of stories where it was used i took a pinch and stepped into the fireplace a little nervously floo powder was definitely not a science frank and linda wood residence i said clearly fireplaces started flying by i closed my eyes to stop from getting too dizzy the swirling motion stopped quickly i opened my eyes to see a small room with a couch along one wall and a chair in the corner a woman around mrs lanolin age was sitting in the chair she stood quickly you d better get out of the way before someone else comes she said kindly oh right i said quickly leaving the fireplace about two seconds later there was a small pop and mrs lanolin appeared she stumbled out of the fireplace recovered quickly and laughed hello harriet the woman in the room said hello linda mrs lanolin said the two women hugged awkwardly afterwards they both stepped back still smiling how are you wood mother asked fine and yourself fine mrs wood turned to me i dontrecognize you she said politely this is laura debman laura this is oliver mother linda mrs lanolin said i smiled and shook mrs wood hand she was looking at me rather oddly oh yes oliver told us you were coming he told us about you mrs wood said still kindly i tried to smile and succeeded a little bit oh um well donthear everything you believe what mrs wood and mrs lanolin asked in unison what i asked the two women laughed she a little nervous i think my furniture may be partially to blame oh i dontknow why you keep that stuff it quite a fright when the chair you re sitting on decides to talk a walk to another room altogether mrs wood said laughing i like it i ve no idea why you two are a little dirty isntyour cloak supposed to keep the ashes off of you laura mrs wood asked smiling i looked down at the cloak and cookies in my hand i forgot to put it on before i left i bent down placed the items on the floor and dusted myself off quickly the doorway would have done that for you dear mrs wood said i looked at the open door and then back at the two women how the two women laughed exchanging a look i didntunderstand magic mrs lanolin said smirking only a little oh right well um i picked my cloak off of the ground put it on hastily and then retrieved my tray of cookies as well oliver is answering the front door with his father he ll tell you where you can put the cookies and where the other children are mrs wood said she motioned towards the only door in the room thank you mrs wood i said i walked out of the small room and into the entrance hall oliver and his dad were leaning against the wall laughing about something they looked a lot alike they both looked over at me and nodded you came after all wood said i said i would yes but i still wasntsure you d come who your friend mr wood asked this is laura debman and this is my dad frank nice to meet you i said walking over to shake his hand you as well i ve heard a lot about you recently i asked mr wood laughed heartily yes good i said a little relieved you brought cookies wood said looking at what i was holding is that ok they re the only thing i can make decently they re not fancy or anything but they re more than fine chocolate chip mr wood asked yes my favorite why dontyou show her to the kitchen oliver ok come with me he said starting to walk towards the inside of the house nice house i said after i d seen enough of it to say that and it was a nice house it was large but not so large that the woods couldntfurnish it well of course wizarding families usually inherited their houses so they had more time to pay for the things to go inside of an impressive house thanks it not a castle but who really needs one right right i agreed right so your father was a quidditch captain too i said after several seconds of silence did aunt harriet already bring that up yeah your family takes quidditch quite seriously of course we do oliver said defensively explains a lot i said simply what do you mean by that just that you re starting to make more sense he looked over at me shook his head slightly and pushed a door open the kitchen he said waiting for me to walk in he followed closely behind nice thank you you can put the cookies on the table with the rest of the desserts oliver said taking them from me and doing it himself i walked over and looked at all of the things on the table there were fancy cakes pies and puddings my cookies looked out of place and i said so dontworry about that magic made these other desserts i have to get back to the door all of the people our age are outside in the backyard right outside of that door by the stove i ll see you later he said leaving quickly i walked out of the kitchen into a well lit backyard about twenty teenagers were hanging around near a couple of tables with drinks and appetizers on them younger kids were running around farther away from the house i joined the gryffindor seventh years girls you came joan said i said i would come we didntthink you would cedar said where rose i asked oh she got to be fashionably late cedar said shaking her head you know rose just like her mother and since her parents were invited they ll have to be twice as late to keep up appearances the four of us laughed we joined adam and mark who were talking to some ravenclaws some hufflepuffs joined us and soon all of us were in one big group having about ten different conversations oliver joined us all after about an hour rose right behind him with flint all of the gryffindor seventh years exchanged looks we laughed when flint walked away from her to go to a different part of the group we thought you d come with him for a moment adam said smiling i wish rose said smirking back adam wrapped his arm around tara waist the two of them never really flirted at hogwarts not around the rest of us at any rate they d been boyfriend and girlfriend before the rest of us had even thought about dating oh stop rubbing it in rose said turning away from them wood had been standing behind her hey you re a quidditch captain she said slyly watch out wood she may decide to stalk you next mark said laughing maybe flint would get jealous if rose joan said rose laughed i was only kidding sure you were cedar said i going to say hello to everyone once more wood said smiling he started making his way through the crowd he not bad looking joan said blushing a little hey mark said the two of them had been dating off an on for a few months she was only stating a fact cedar said she didntmean anything by it i know then why are you hey ing cedar asked i was only kidding mark answered oh well why didntyou just say so the rest of us laughed he not that cute adam said yes he is i said without thinking they all looked at me surprised just forget i said it i said blushing said what dave grather cedar boyfriend asked walking up behind her nothing i said she just said that wood is cute which is true so it not a big deal joan said laura said that dave asked i going to get a butterbeer when everyone stops making something out of nothing i ll be back i said leaving to let them get the whole thing out of their systems i pushed my way through the crowd around the closest table there were probably about forty people there now ranging in ages from thirteen to almost twenty most of them were children of oliver parents friends laura i looked up fred and george were looking at me i smiled kindly hi how are you what are you doing here one of them asked is percy here the other asked the first looked at the other and slapped him in the back of the head playfully you re right the second said of course i right percy wouldntbe caught dead within a mile of this place neither would she the two of them looked at me again i cantmake friends i snapped oh forget it i walked back to the gryffindors slowly after a few minutes i could join in the conversation again without feeling guilty oliver joined us again after several minutes music started playing somewhere inside of the woods house from the outside the house looked a lot smaller than it clearly was inside that didntsurprise me that much many houses were enchanted to look smaller than they were it made the houses and therefore the wizards living there less conspicuous to muggles well the adults must be getting drunk enough to make fools out of themselves cedar said still laughing a little from the conversation we had just finished it classical music i said they should still be sober enough to realize that wood said laughing and checking a muggle watch what happens when they re not i asked nothing that makes sense rose said how do you know we ll go in there soon for dinner wood said oh something wrong dave asked no i just said oh i said but it sounded like there was something wrong dave said nothing you donthave to dance wood said good joan laughed that what was wrong i shrugged i dontlike dancing no one in there will remember dave said well that not entirely true cedar interrupted the people under eighteen will remember twenty one my parents wontserve alcohol to anyone under twenty one we know adam muttered when wood turns twenty one the age limit will go up again dave said grinning at him probably wood admitted let go inside and get some food rose said i starving there was a lot of good food there i couldntmake up my mind about what i wanted so i tried to randomly choose things that didntcontain the same foods which was taking the random part out of it when we reached the desserts i was shocked to see about eight people huddled around my cookies these taste homemade a woman around fifty said with her mouth full they re different another middle aged woman said not in a bad way someone cooked these they re only chocolate chip cookies i muttered to myself who made these an elderly lady asked laura did oliver said from behind me i turned to see him pointing and turned back blushing to the people around the cookies you did the elderly lady asked me kindly yeah where d you learn to make them there a recipe on the back of the chocolate chips bag but i a recipe see they re homemade one of the other ladies interrupted speaking to the other women told you not to worry wood said laughing a little under his breath i turned around but he was walking towards the table the rest of the gryffindors were sitting at you re a muggle a middle aged man said what i asked facing him no she isn t hank her parents must be the elderly woman said i didntknow how to respond i wasntsure whether homemade cookies were a good thing or not your cooking is good laura one of the younger women said go off with your friends i forgot about getting a dessert for myself i just walked back to the table confused i sat down in between joan and tara i know there something wrong now dave said from his glass she made cookies wood said simply the others all nodded understandingly i cursed being the only muggle born in the group any sort of manual effort is different joan said different bad no different good dave said holding up part of one of my cookies oh well then whatever they all laughed but didnttalk about baking cookies anymore after about an hour we d all had more than enough to eat and had digested enough to start getting bored let dance cedar said standing and holding her hand out to dave dave was a big guy but he wasntdominant by any means still he just looked up at her someone spiked the punch rose said cedar laughed we cantdance sober we dance every year joan said shrugging outside dave added well we re practically adults now cedar said there was a short silence while the rest of them thought about this i was confused again i confused again i said we ve just never really thought about staying in here joan explained like she was explaining why two plus two equals four dance with me tara said also standing and looking at adam adam shrugged and stood up ok the two of them walked out to the center of the dance floor which was positioned in between most of the tables in the upper center of the room there were only a few couples on the dance floor and they smiled at the young couple that had joined them huh wood said huh what i asked i still wasntquite following what the big deal was we really are almost adults joan said a little sadly because you re dancing inside i asked because we want to dance inside in front of everyone because the older people seem to be expecting it she said looking at me i d heard that age hits people hard every once in a while i always thought they were talking about midlife crises not growing up huh i said looking back at tara and adam i thought you were all just crazy maybe a little joan said are you going to embarrass me making me stand here with my hand out asking you to dance all night cedar asked dave sighed deeply before standing up and walking very reluctantly to the dance floor other seventh years from other houses had taken tara and adam lead and were also heading out to the floor joan and mark joined them all leaving wood rose and me i missing my chance rose said standing wish me luck good luck i said why let him try to turn me down she said flashing a sly smile wood and i watched and clapped when rose finally succeeded in dragging marcus flint out onto the dance floor the few other slytherins there just laughed wonder what she threatened him with wood said i shrugged probably nothing he hasntbeen threatened with before probably not nope we watched our friends for a few minutes maybe we should have brought dates huh wood asked the people i d have asked wouldnthave been able to come anyway i said percy no friends back home muggles oh yeah the magic may have been a little hard to explain wood said just a little probably he said yeah one song ended and another song started up the music seemed to be coming from no where where is the music coming from i asked a radio with the volume up pretty high wood said oh good idea it works we just turn the radio down when commercials come on another good idea you dontknow how to dance do you what i asked looking at him that why you dontwant to dance you dontknow how i know how i said indignantly then let dance with you i asked he laughed two friends cantdance i dontlike dancing in front of people you dontknow how i do prove it he said leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms why you wouldntlike to prove me wrong i didntrespond you cantprove me wrong i just dontwant to i said fully realizing that he knew i never didntwant to prove him wrong i ll bet you that you cantdance wood said why would i make a stupid i ll bet you a knut that you cantdance i didntanswer again i knew i was right well it not like i couldntfigure it out i said looking at the dance floor i recognized the steps it was just the one where the couple did the box type steps wood stood up and motioned i dontwant to figure it out here i whispered harshly why not everyone has to learn eventually not in front of everyone all of us learned in front of everyone there were just less everyones out in the backyard wood said he smiled i ll teach you how to dance you ll catch on immediately i looked up at him with a pained expression i going to regret this you won t i promise wood said stepping back a little and motioning to the group of dancers again i walked to the edge of the group with him making sure we were closest to empty tables most of the people in the room had gone to the center of the room to dance or had gone back outside right take my hand good now put your other hand on the back of your shoulder i can see everyone else i snapped do you want to learn i clearly remember saying no to that quite a few times i muttered barely touching his shoulder he laughed and put his hand on my back now step backwards a little with your left foot no that your right right no left i laughed and stepped backwards a little he followed with his opposite foot now back with the right foot i did he continued to tell me exactly what to do i followed his directions but things still werentgoing very well everything was choppy instead of flowing and i was a little unsteady which didnthelp at all ouch wood said after i stepped on his foot for the first time sorry i said dontlook down it throwing you off dontlook anywhere below my shoulders he said letting go of my hand and lifting my chin up dontlook down he repeated taking my hand again ok i just going to say which foot to move and not where to move it ok you know we re drawing a square with our steps ok left right right left dontlook down at your feet i forgot i said looking up quickly he laughed you re doing fine liar you are you re doing the steps and i not even telling you what to do he said i am i am i said looking down at my feet i looked up again quickly dontlook down ok now keep dancing but look over at the other people do you see how they re forming a box with their steps but are moving in more of a circle yes ok keep looking away from your feet but follow my lead i ll make it so we do that ok after a few rounds i was letting him lead and like he said we were dancing like everyone else i laughed happily joan clapped from a meters away told you i could figure it out i said smiling to show that i was kidding that will be five knuts for your lesson wood said smiling back i laughed i ll get it to you as soon as i can i looked him in the eyes for the first time since we d started dancing and when he returned my gaze it scared me a little i looked away slowly so wood said after a few seconds how has your first wizard party been going i laughed let see first i met your aunt who almost immediately started talking about quidditch which wasntthat bad then she sends me to the fireplace being guarded by furniture that moves your uncle by marriage walks up behind me almost giving me heart failure to suddenly turn on a chair that gets too close to the fire sparky oliver interrupted sparky that its name sparky well sparky got kicked your aunt comes back and we leave then i make a fool out of myself in front of your mum and mrs lanolin my cookies pointed out to everyone that i not like them and then someone i hated for almost five years for no reason taught me how to dance are you having fun he asked i laughed i having a great time i said seriously i thought you would i could have used a warning about the furniture though and what fun would that be for you or for me i asked he laughed sorry my aunt furniture moves so dontbe too surprised when you see it ok your aunt furniture moves she allergic to animal dander oh ok and i have a muggle uncle who hates the whole rest of my family and my family is obsessed with quidditch and you may have to dance with me just to save your pride i may have to stay home he smiled a little i kidding i know he said half heartedly oliver all of the things you just warned me about are ok i know he said with a little more confidence you re a good teacher thanks you re welcome laura a voice asked from behind me i let go of wood hand so i could turn around a flash went off and mr wood lowered a camera that should turn out well he said nodding and walking away i laughed and turned back to oliver who was blushing a little my parents are the same way are you thirsty no but go on and get yourself something to drink he said taking his hand off of my waist i was planning on it i took my hand off of his shoulder i got some punch at the main table fred and george were standing there looking a little suspicious spiking it i asked no dying it blood red one said simply oh and adding fake fingers he confirmed i laughed i ll remember that well you catch on quickly the other said nodding behind me at wood and an older woman dancing you re here too i said does percy know who cares i interrupted he doesn t he broke up with penelope the first said quickly i looked at him skeptically well she broke up with him he added how is he i asked who cares asked one you don t said the other that not fair i said you two donteven like percy no one said dumping a bag of fake fingers in the punch but we love him the two boys nodded and walked away i wasntused to getting guilt trips from them not that they talked to me unless i was at the burrow he handsome a woman around twenty five to thirty said walking up next to me she reached for the ladle to the punch and changed her mind quickly it just food dye i said a little coldly sorry the woman said defensively no i smiled at her i sorry just a bit of bad news which one is handsome which one i mean i canttell them apart to save my life but oh you thought i was referring to the weasley twins no although they ll be handsome as well in a few years if they re anything like their older brothers probably i agreed i laura by the way i janet nice to meet you you as well are your parents here no i said nonchalantly neither are mine i in the same department as frank wood at the ministry oh what department quidditch i laughed the same as five years ago what was five years ago i shook my head long story you go to school with their son yeah we re in the same house and year i ve never seen you here before she said deciding to drink the punch even if it did look like blood oh um this was the first year i could make it i see i doubt it i said partially to myself who were you saying was handsome frank son i had been looking over the crowd i stopped and laughed you dontagree i agree i was just expecting you to say someone else who janet asked scanning the crowd like i had been no one in particular anyone i guess it hard to see your friends that way she said i thought for a second something like that she looked at me raising an eyebrow long story i repeated sounds interesting i ll have to ask frank about it what oliver tells him everything within reason of course oh i winced a little without meaning to it was nice meeting you she said she was looking towards a man around her age walking over you too we enjoyed watching you learn how to dance she said without looking away from the man she walked away to meet him partway more everyones than the rest of us i mumbled to myself walking back to the table we d eaten at the rest of the seventh year gryffindors were there dave was with some of his ravenclaw friends how many drinks did you get wood asked jokingly oh i was talking to one of your dad coworkers why cedar asked she got my attention right away i said how oh just heard her talking to herself i said before taking a sip of the pre dyed punch you caught on quickly to the dance it took adam hours tara said smiling at him she had a better teacher adam said grinning back he had more practice tara countered you ve taught a lot of people to dance i asked a few wood said shrugging he taught all of us girls to dance joan said the three of us only took about an hour in total to learn now mark and adam were a different story you taught mark and adam how to slow dance i asked laughing it would have gone a lot faster if he had joan said also laughing we had to learn how to lead that harder mark said you learned that what important tara said how many other people have you taught i asked wood a few ravenclaws and hufflepuffs a few cousins a year cedar said smiling he good at it i nodded were you serious about he five knuts no wood interrupted ok i thought you were kidding but it seems like you re running a business so has anyone ever owed you a knut for that bet i asked a knut cedar asked he bet me a sickle i was positive that you didntknow how to dance wood said smirking and you werentpositive i couldn t you only bet me a knut adam said laughing you made that bet with adam too i asked donttake it personally wood said i wasn t i was only kidding adam said oh i knew that um who taught you how to dance mum wood said simply when i was twelve he taught us when we were thirteen wood and i would be stuck dancing together because adam and tara and joan and mark would choose each other cedar said laughing i shrugged you could have danced with other people we did oliver taught lots of girls how to dance probably most of the seventh years and a fair amount of the sixth years ah i forced a little laugh hoping that it sounded natural enough well i was a little late but i got my lesson hum no one said anything i was wondering if i had sounded offended when i realized why they werenttalking no one was then i wondered how many people had heard what i said was everyone waiting to see how wood reacted i hadntseemed that hurt i wasntthat hurt what i whispered as quietly as i could wood put a finger to his lips then pointed to his watch i pulled his arm across the table so i could see the time there was a little less than a minute until midnight i looked at him raising an eyebrow wood just put his finger to his mouth again i sat in silence more confused than any time that night about twenty seconds later a bang went off i jumped and almost screamed not that it would have mattered if i would have screamed everyone in the room had started cheering another bang went off and everyone looked up at the top of the room miniature fireworks were going off i watched the five minute show with awe for the designs the fireworks were making they spelled things they formed pictures they stayed lit longer than any muggle fireworks they were magnificent there a minute of silence at the end of the year to signify the year passing and those that passed with it wood explained after the short show oh another thing that i could have been warned about i said much more coldly than i planned on are you ok cedar asked i looked over at her yes you seem upset she said no i still just a little confused most things tonight have been different than i used to we understand joan said time for my favorite time of the night adam said what i asked games they all said standing up i stood up with them games what sort of games wizards and warlocks adam said almost jumping up and down he was so happy adam team always wins tara said smiling at him how it work i asked wait and listen to the directions wood said we were gathering in the middle of the room with most of the other people there who were under fifty years old mr wood was in the middle of the room with two flags one was black with fire coming out from around a dark figure the other was blue with two wands crossing forming an x with sparks surrounding them all right for those of you who have never played wizards and warlocks or for those of you who have forgotten here are the rules first the two teams may only have two people guarding the flag an unlimited number of others may guard the territory but may not come within twenty feet of the flag itself second at any time you may cross into the other team side but when you do they may capture you and you must walk back to the jail which is this house at the front door a teammate must come to the door which is considered neutral territory to retrieve you you may leave only after you ve spent five minutes at the door you are obligated to come immediately here once being tagged by a member of the opposing team a person can free as many teammates from the jail as they wish simply by touching them third once a team has gotten possession of the flag they must get it onto their side before they have won and last of all any strategy may be used as long as you remain on the ground magic may be used if you have graduated from hogwarts or another wizarding school magic may not be used on a person only objects these objects may be anything as long as they will not harm a person also the flags themselves cannot be tampered with in any way and must be within plain sight that it first team to get the other team flag on their side of the field wins mr wood concluded are there any boundaries someone asked oh yes i almost forgot thank you the field is a square mile the center of which is the front door the house is out of bounds you have to go around it the boundaries are marked by a red light you cantmistake them if you come across them a team flag may be anywhere on their team side one team the wizards will have the south side towards town the division between the two sides is marked by a yellow line along the ground that wontinterfere with running this is capture the flag i said relieved except there magic joan said quietly dontunderestimate that fact ok chosing teams mr wood said each side will have an even amount of students and people who can use magic mr wood chose two men to choose teams the adults were chosen first then the students adam was the first student chosen i ended up on his team with joan and wood tara mark cedar and dave were on the wizards team ok go outside hide your flag and strategize the game will begin in fifteen minutes wherever your flag is at that time it will stay until a member of the other team touches it and yes the flag will know ready set go mr wood yelled all of us ran out of the house from different exits i followed the people on my team to the north side of the house we were all wearing black armbands that were charmed to make sure we didntcheat we all stopped about halfway into our area according to other warlocks they decided to hang our flag out of a tree it was visible but not horribly so ok adam what the plan i asked as all of us gathered together hey i dontplan i just always win he said shrugging we ve got to find the other team flag first we should split up into small groups and look around leaving about a third of us over here to watch our own flag and set traps wood said everyone nodded there were about forty of us ok how about half of the adults stay here since you can use magic you can set a few traps or decoys you guys figure out who going to watch the flag the rest of us should sneak over once someone sees it they should come back quickly and clear the jail out then we can strategize more wood continued what if the other team finds our flag and doesntdelay an attempt at getting it i asked they wontget very far a young man said strategy and teamwork is the only way to win this game the games usually last at least an hour you ll catch on quickly especially if you stick with wood here ok i said i was only asking i didntreally know what i was talking about ok let split up adam said clapping his hands once we all cheered although not too loudly since we didntwant to tip the other team off to our position remember we cantcross the yellow line until the siren sounds wood said loudly as we all started jogging in different directions adam joan wood and i all went together wood decided we should head towards one of the boundaries first while we didntwant to follow one of them we also didntwant to go straight down the middle of the field any ideas where they ll hid it i asked nope that what makes this game fun adam said what makes this game fun for you is that you always win joan said laughing that doesnthurt we kept walking the siren went off before we even could see the yellow line so that wasntan issue anymore when we did get within sight of it we could hear some people coming the four of us hid behind trees quietly and waited until the people were passing before jumping out and tagging all of them quickly they all muttered their disappointment but they were only about twelve or thirteen and no one really expected anything different from them maybe we re in too big of a group wood said we ll be heard just as easily as they were not if we donttalk i d rather stick together joan said i agree i said scared of the dark adam asked us a little i admitted the guys laughed joan pointed to herself and nodded mouthing me too we ll just have to rely on you men then wontwe she said aloud sarcastically damn straight adam said hiking up his pants we kept walking and about fifteen minutes later we were tagged by people on the other team we walked back to the front door as quickly as we could laughing and not worrying about making noise or not we figured it would only help our teammates who were trying to go quietly we found the front door not liberated which was good we d get to learn where the flag was with everyone else about ten minutes later the man who d explained about the game lasting a long time came with whom i assumed was his wife they tagged all of the people who d been there five minutes and we followed the pair into our territory a little farther the flag is about halfway into their area on the west side almost right on the boundary i d say it probably about twenty feet from it in fact the man said so the best strategy would probably be to split into pairs and half of the pairs go around and come in from the back and the others take their time and come in from our direction hopefully we ll all come in at around the same time sounds good to me adam said i ll go with you wood let the girl go with him then she ll be able to participate in the next two games if it comes down to that the man partner said next two games i asked we play best two out of three if one team wins in two games we ll play another game instead of this one again wood said and each of these games last at least an hour i asked that why you re coming home with me joan said laughing wood and i ended up in the half that was going to come in from the front we had no problems not talking so that ended up being a plus for us of course that was about the only plus we were doing pretty well until wood led us into a trap one moment we re walking carefully and pretty quietly towards the other side flag the next thing i know we re up in the air in a net i screamed a little late it was a delayed reaction i guess anyway i screamed after the net was done ensnaring the two of us it wasnta small net but was still intended for only one person i ended up sitting on wood legs with my back up against part of the net you were following way too close wood snapped obviously you led me right into this you think i did on purpose or something no can they do this this has got to be breaking some rule i said trying to find a more comfortable position stop moving oliver said we re lucky we ended up in a halfway reasonable position i dontthink you have to use your imagination to understand what i mean i blushed which didntreally matter because it was so dark i could barely see his silhouette how far up are we i asked you re in a better position to judge that he said he was angled so that he was looking more up than anything i ll have to move then i said leaning to see the ground better i d say we re about five feet up five feet well it wouldntkill us to fall that distance no but it d hurt i answered i sighed and leaned up against the netting the best that i could in my position so we just wait for someone to magic us out of this thing yes they ll come check the trap sometime that an unwritten rule to this game luckily traps however are perfectly legal you werentlooking for them it hard to see them in the dark a light would be a dead giveaway though so people get caught in these things every year so much for learning from you i muttered i did teach you how to dance you know what i meant he didntanswer right away well at least you learned what it like to get trapped i laughed what else could i do you re sitting on my legs he said i ll try to slide down so i only leaning against them then i said and surprisingly i succeeded so i guess there no point in being quiet now huh i asked it d probably serve us better to talk i nodded pointlessly have a nice christmas yes you yes get your homework done he asked yes yeah me too there was a pause how percy he asked not funny wood why i meant it he sounded serious fred and george said that he broke up with penelope cantsay i heartbroken over that but i dontknow well you wonthave to hang around me anymore then he said what if i wanted to i asked looking in his approximate direction you want to yes all of you i ve had a good time around you all seems stupid to give it up just because i dontneed it anymore unless you would object to that i said getting a little defensive no do whatever you like i will then i paused thank you for saying that you could hang around us you never needed my permission for that even when you wouldnthave gotten it there nothing i could have done about you being there i meant thank you for making me feel welcome with you in the first place oh there were a few seconds before he said you re welcome laura thanks wood why do you call me wood and not oliver i looked over at him everyone calls you wood not girls i laughed that not true anyway what does it matter you called me oliver when we were younger i still missing the point and i still call you oliver sometimes when you mean something yes isntthat good you know when i mean something i d rather think you always meant what you said i do i just mean some things more and you haventalways called me laura yes i have no you haven t in our second year after that whole fight you didntcall me anything at all in our third and fourth years you called me you in our fifth year i was promoted to hey you and then in our sixth year you didntcall me anything at all again wood laughed how do you remember that i just do i remember a lot about people things that dontmatter why do you call me wood instead of oliver he asked again i sighed you arentgoing to drop this are you no if you tell me why it matters then maybe i ll think of why i dontcall you oliver fair enough he said it matters because how you address someone tells a little about what you think about them and i want to know why you only call me wood i looked down well down a little bit into my lap i never really thought about it not really i guess oliver is just a more personal way of addressing you and i still being civil with each other still seems strange sometimes ok i didntmean that in a mean way or i know ok oliver call me wood or oliver it doesntreally matter i started to roll my eyes but stopped myself there no reason why i shouldntcall you oliver even if i not used to you being my friend you are and if calling you oliver is important to you then oliver you are it not important if it werentthen i dontthink you would have asked or i could have just been trying to get a rise out of you you ve had enough practice with that to find better ways of doing it true he said seriously by merlin beard it is taking a long time for someone to come to our rescue that funny because i my friends am bymerlinsbeard shameless i know someone should have come by now right the readers probably think so too bad i have to establish some character traits to make the story more believable later not necessarily if the game is going strong then the other team ll probably purposely stay clear of here because we re two people they donthave to worry about even if they think we re only one person but what about our team it a square mile of land chance would be the only to bring them here unless we yell which would bring both sides here good they ll get us down but our side would get tagged and that would do more harm than good there are two more games we ll play then if we get down by then i muttered right he said seriously it too bad you didntgo with adam i said you still may have ended up in this trap just with joan they d have sent adam and i the long way just to keep adam out of the way his team always wins but not thanks to him i laughed that wasntvery nice hey i a quidditch captain strategy matters more than people feelings to me maybe in quidditch it does but i dontbelieve that applies in every day life no no then you may end up unpleasantly surprised one day oliver said i shook my head i dontthink you ve changed that much since we started hogwarts i ve changed a lot so have you i ve had to i guess to keep up with everything i have too to the point where you dontcare about others feelings that isntwhat i said i dontcare to the point where others feelings will get in the way in the way of what what i want he said simply and unapologetically you sound like a slytherin i said i dontnot care that much he said is there much of a difference between how much you dontcare and that much what are you lecturing me how many times have you put your wants or needs on hold for others feelings more than you ll ever know oh name one every time percy needed me every time percy needed you i took a deep breath look we ve been doing well we re stuck in a net together and we haventfought yet but we re right on the brink of doing so i want to know how you ve helped percy but it isntany of your business is it i interrupted a little more harsly than i d wanted to i took another breath i sorry no you re right it isntany of my business i smiled into the darkness i think we just solved a disagreement without many harsh words god help us we re actually learning to get along oliver said laughing a horn sounded a little ways off we won he said how can you tell the tone was the warlocks tone it lower than the wizards someone should be coming along soon and he was right about five minutes later without any conversations a member of the other side did come to check her trap oliver she asked hey aunt celeste she laughed in a sort of sing song laugh well i certainly didntexpect to catch you here oliver and it even more of a shock to find another person with you mind introducing me mind getting us down first oliver asked although good naturedly the woman magicked us out of her trap and the two of us painfully straightened our backs she looked kind of young to be oliver aunt she was maybe thirty i laura debman i said offering the woman my hand nice to meet you laura i celeste wood she said shaking my hand firmly how do you know oliver hogwarts he said we re both in gryffindor seventh years are you a seventh year now why i cantbelieve it it seems like you were just a first year days ago no it doesn t wood said laughing it doesntnow but as you get older the faster the years will seem to go for you we watched you teach laura how to dance it was more interesting to watch than most years celeste said looking at me and smiling kindly oliver laughed you all still watch me dance it why your mother still has these parties i thought you danced outside i said he did and my family would come out and try to look inconspicuous and failed miserably obviously celeste said laughing i couldnthelp smiling when she laughed she was just that kind of person she could spread cheer easily i easily got over the fact that i had just hung out of a tree in a net for the past half an hour i think you re getting better at dancing oliver celeste said looking him in the eyes they were almost exactly the same height thank you he said my lack of coordination must make you look good i said no that wasntit she said she laughed we should get back to the house for the next round broomsticks are allowed in the next match the two woods started for the house with me close behind although with more of a distance than the last time i d followed oliver our team lost the next game but won the last one further proving adam to be a good luck charm i had fun acting as a decoy with joan so others could sneak in and take the flag while the wizards attention was diverted we went back into the main room to find the older couples dancing all of us watched them for a few songs mr wood came up on my left near the end of the second song when i was a boy this is how all of the dancing was the dances were more complex and there were more dances than just the one you learned tonight i nodded still watching the people on the floor it wasntonly individual couples moving along to the beat of their own drums everything was synchronized the man nearest to me was dancing just as much with the woman on the farthest side of the floor as he was with his dancing partner children dontlearn the old dances anymore i only know one or two mr wood continued have oliver learn them so he can teach them to all of us i said smiling and looking at mr wood briefly he has no desire to learn them and i dontblame him it a new time it not these people age anymore he said motioning towards the older couples i always think of the wizarding world as having no ages it seems old fashioned to me although we can do things i only dreamed were possible when i was little some things magic can do i couldnteven dream of now no things change just as quickly in the magical world as they do in the muggle one he paused but that isntwhat i wanted to speak with you about i stopped smiling and looked over at the man standing beside me it took less than the tone of this voice to know that i wouldntenjoy what was coming all right i said but if you re going to talk about what happened five years ago no mr wood interrupted just one thing ok i said cautiously leave him alone mr wood said he walked away without even looking at me my mouth was hanging open a little as i watched him leave i was confused i continued to look in the same direction even a few minutes after mr wood retreating back had disappeared in the crowd something wrong i turned to see oliver and shook my head more to say i didntknow than to say no but wood took it as a no well then it kind of an off year as far as teaching people to dance goes thanks a lot i said no i mean there no one to teach i going to assume that didntcome out right either i said laughing it didn t oliver said he laughed the party will end soon now that wizards and warlocks is over the rest of the time people will just spend dancing and talking and well we both need someone to dance with i raised an eyebrow you re asking me to dance yes did hell freeze over because i told percy to notify me immediately if it did oliver laughed a little under his breath you danced with me before and it wasnta big deal you made me oh i see i just have to guilt you into it again then right i laughed no i dontthink my pride can take that twice in one night good wood said motioning towards the dance floor well i was going to ask that cute ravenclaw over there if he d like to dance but then what kind of friend would i be who maybe i can introduce you to him oliver said turning towards where the ravenclaws were sitting i was kidding i said walking onto the floor oh wood said following i had fun dancing with him we didntargue even when i stepped on his foot after about thirty minutes see how could you not look like a good dancer in comparison to me i asked smiling dontlook down at the floor you looked down yeah sorry you admit it admit it what looking down at the floor sure i admit it i did it but there was a time when you d have never admitted it and during that time i never would ve been dancing with you i said laughing you re right see i never thought you d say that to me either oliver only nodded looking over my shoulder should i dare to turn around and see what you re looking at no there nothing to see my dad was looking strangely over here for a minute oh i said forgetting to dance for a few beats causing wood to step on my foot sorry he said getting us back on the beat why d you stop your dad doesntlike me he knows about you wood said seriously i laughed because it was the first reaction to come to me ouch i only told him the truth including recently i tell him everything even that you donthate me anymore i asked carefully and how do you know i don t i serious oliver yes i told him that i donthate you and he doesntbelieve you he believes me he just doesn t agree with me i nodded trying to keep myself from getting angry i can understand i guess joan tapped me on the shoulder and i turned around away from wood she was smiling to herself ready to go i asked putting my hands down at my sides yes she said still smiling thank you for inviting us oliver he nodded i glad you could come i ll walk you to the fireplace we thanked oliver parents mr wood didntshow any signs of not trusting me mrs wood hugged joan and then me i smiled broadly back at her after she let go you kids keep growing up so quickly she said looking at us i have pictures of you all when you were eleven it amazing how much you change in those seven years at hogwarts isntit i agreed trying to remember any pictures being taken of me when i was eleven it was possible but i didntremember ever meeting oliver parents until that night we thanks mr and mrs wood again before following oliver into the hallway there will always be these parties wontthere joan asked what do you mean wood asked i mean after we graduate we ll always be able to see each other on new year s for many years yes he said smiling kindly at joan how long have there been new year parties here i asked since my grandfather was young wow i said it tradition that why dad keeps having these parties will you joan asked wood looked at her questioningly i mean if you inherit the house years from now will there still be new year parties here oliver shrugged i ve never really thought about it i guess as long as people keep coming there will be parties here good joan said as we reached the room we would leave from thanks for inviting us oliver she said reaching up to hug him he returned her hug without seeming uncomfortable at all was there ever someone i could hug like that that i wasntrelated to percy yes i used to be able to hug percy like that just a friendly hug that didntmean anything except everything something wrong oliver asked i snapped back into the real world and forced myself to smile quickly no i lied i was just thinking about percy oh wood said plainly joan slapped him playfully if you two could only be friends again i said he looked a little irritated but forced himself to smile too we would both have to give up too much he said too much what joan asked pride oliver said he laughed a little under his breath thanks for coming girls see you in a couple of days i spent a few hours at joan house sleeping before getting ready to go back to oliver aunt house to get my car and drive home after saying goodbye to joan family who treated me like an honored guest during breakfast i walked with joan into the living room where their fireplace was you re glad you came arentyou joan asked i nodded yeah thank you very much for letting me stay here until after curfew was over it was no problem our pleasure the pleasure was mine joan laughed now that the necessary polite comments are over i meant it i know you did but you had fun last night of course you looked like you were but i wasntsure why not because it looked like you were having fun with oliver wood it was my turn to laugh it was kind of reassuring like when we were younger we ve all tried to be his friends and we succeeded laura dontget me wrong we ve just never been able to be his best friends i shrugged quidditch it oliver best friend i said plainly now it is anyways it nice to see you two as friends again yes i agreed why didnthe invite percy and i to the party when we were first years percy was there his parents invited people when oliver was younger his parents didntknow your parents so they didntinvite them oh i looked at the clock i late thanks again for letting me stay anytime i ll see you tomorrow i groaned ugh back to school work she smiled and hogwarts i took a small amount of floo powder and went to mrs lanolin house she was sitting in one of the chairs which i thought was rather brave of her when she saw me she stood up smiling broadly hello she said loudly hello sorry i late it ok it was a late night you probably overslept by a few minute right i smiled let her assume what she wanted have a nice time yes i said kindly following her through the living room still making an attempt to stay away from the furniture good thank you for letting me keep the car here overnight and use your fireplace mrs lanolin i said once we d reached the front door oh anything for oliver friends she opened the door slightly let me know if you ever need to borrow the fireplace again ok she asked i nodded thank you happy new year i said placing a hand on the door you too i left the house quickly knowing this time what it was that the neighbors werentsupposed to see i drove home and slept most of the day that evening i got my stuff together for school author note yes that was a long chapter almost 50 pages i didntwant to cut the christmas vacation into pieces i hope you liked the chapter despite its length in the next chapter many secrets revealed what enigma is the quidditch stadium holding what is up with that ford anglia and what happened to daniel weasley how exciting chapter 6 quidditch captains i sat with percy on the way back to hogwarts he was still depressed about breaking up with penelope he said that they mutually decided to break up because penelope felt like she needed more space i listened sympathetically i was happy though i had percy back as mad as i was at him for ditching me for months i forgave him because i needed him i still needed him when school started again the teachers were all placing their emphasis on preparing us for the n e w t s it was well nauseatingly exhausting i spent most of my spare time with percy in the library studying really i spent most of my time with percy everything was going back to how it was before percy and penelope started dating percy and i were best friends again i was really happy for a while until i realized that i missed my other friends percy and oliver were fighting more than they ever had they wouldntjust ignore each other anymore they would go out of their way to start something but now i wasnton percy side or oliver side no now i was trying to play the role of the peacemaker if studying for n e w t s was nauseatingly exhausting trying to keep the peace between two of my friends was impossibly grueling i usually spent about half an hour with the rest of the seventh years while percy got ready for bed he went to bed earlier than most of us did why do you put up with that bloody idiot oliver asked one night a few days into february i rubbed my temples you two give me the worst headaches i muttered he left you alone for over a year and you automatically just welcomed i interrupted him by holding up my hand i tired oliver just give it a rest for tonight ok oliver didntanswer he just stood up and left i looked over at the rest of the seventh years and smiled a little i cantput up with them for much longer maybe you should talk to him joan said he seemed a little mad i sighed but stood up all right i walked out of the common room and turned to the fat lady do you know where oliver went that way the fat lady said pointing to her left thanks i turned relieved at least he didntgo the other way the left part of the hallway led to a short hallway with two dead ends i walked down to the little hall and saw oliver looking out the window on my left i walked up behind him i sorry i cut you off go ahead and say what you need to oliver shook his head i trying oliver i sighed again the truth is i ve never been able to be a good friend to you both percy always seems to get the better deal he said blandly he smiled a little at me i grinned back i sorry i walked up next to him to look out the window too there was a full moon shining wonderfully on the lake it was beautiful i miss you i whispered all of you i added quickly i blushed hadnti been planning on saying all of you to begin with so you ignore us wood said shaking his head what am i supposed to do tell percy that i going to spend some time with my other friends leave him alone haventi done that one too many times i trying to learn and the two of you fight so badly i cantspend time with you both cantor won t both i admitted what about joan oliver asked quickly she took you under her wing and when you didntneed her anymore you left she doesntneed me either i said looking down at my hands which were resting on the window sill but she misses you we all do i moved my thumbs around each other slowly if you would only apologize not again do you ever ask him to you know as well as i do that he would never make the first move at becoming friends then why should i oliver asked bitterly so it can be like it was i said looking up at him oliver didntanswer he kept looking out the window angrily i sighed i ll spend more time with you guys if you want to be with percy then i want to be with you i interrupted i blushed again i put a hand up to my forehead to check my temperature knowing that i was fine you know what i meant i muttered oliver didntsay anything for a few minutes so i tried to explain what i was thinking you know the last time i was really happy was when we were all first and second years maybe for a few weeks the summer before our fourth year too but never mind even though we were technically competing over percy all of the time you were still my friend oliver maybe that why i took percy side i could win the competition i wish i hadn t now you know i sorry about what happened i know you know that i know you re sorry too now you can end it after five years you can end it we can just be three equal friends he looked down at me kindly and my stomach dropped dontmake things more complicated i told myself sternly and i knew that it was too late for us to be three equal friends i didntneed oliver to know it i certainly didntneed percy to know it i could deal with it it didntmatter it would go away i wontapologize he said but i ll try to stop fighting with him so much you know for your sake because i rather enjoy arguing with him i laughed i know what you mean i kind of enjoy arguing with him too and you for that matter he looked down at me and i scared myself again i nodded and walked away quickly saying something about homework and sleeping i went upstairs and talked myself into believing that nothing had changed since since hell since when didntmatter nothing had changed since whenever i did start spending more time with the rest of the seventh years percy didntseem to care much while this did hurt a little it was almost a relief as it made things easier i still spent more time with percy than i did with my other friends but i spent enough time with them that it was normal when i was with them and not forced as it had been when i had spent less than an hour a day with them around the beginning of march i got bored studying with percy and decided to go look for other people i going to go outside i getting cabin fever i said yeah ok percy said distracted by his studying and dreams of receiving enough n e w t s to put him in a good position at the ministry i went out to the front steps and looked around the grounds there were people sitting around on the grass near the lake mainly first and second years the older students on the grounds were studying i didntwant to do more of that i decided to go to the quidditch pitch gryffindor was still in the running for the quidditch cup and oliver spent any free time he had trying to figure out how they were going to win it i worried that he was neglecting his studies but he assured me that he was studying more than i thought he was sure enough oliver was flying idly around the goals on the other side of the field from where i d come in he seemed to be deep in though i walked across the grass he noticed me when i got a little past half way to him he flew over and landed right in front of me smiling hey he said something wrong no i just got tired of memorizing potions ingredients from potions we haventdone since we were first years how are your plans going we re going to win that cup oliver said i nodded i hope you do why you couldntcare less about quidditch oliver said walking with me towards the locker rooms true but i want gryffindor to do well in everything and i want you to do well too i know how much the cup means to you he nodded dontworry i have no doubts that you ll win it this year he loosened up again thanks we kept walking in silence for several seconds there something i want to show you ok where is it i asked the locker room kind of anyway you ll see i d never been in the locker rooms before gryffindor was rather dull but comfortable oliver walked up next to a chalkboard with some x and o drawn onto it he pulled it out away from the wall on one side it through here he said motioning behind the chalkboard through where the wall i asked he smiled why do you look surprised this is hogwarts quidditch stadium isntit it through the wall i asked again he nodded turned walked behind the chalkboard and disappeared i hurried over to look i was feeling along the wall when his hand shot out and pulled me through i hit another wall about two feet past the one i d just gone through it didnthurt much since right after pulling me through the wall oliver pushed me back a little people have heart attacks because of things like that i said under my breath sorry oliver said shortly i looked up i couldntsee anything where are we i asked in between the outer wall and what everyone assumes is the outer wall suddenly i felt very claustrophobic and of course i said so yeah that the drawback about this whole thing oliver agreed it worth it trust me i sighed god help me but i do he laughed just keep walking towards your left you can probably walk normally but it will make the space seem smaller if you walk sideways there more room on each side of you ok i said following his voice it was pitch black in the little space i reached out and found his arm so i grabbed his sleeve nervous oliver asked i cantsee you this way i wontrun into you i said you wontrun into me not this way i won t i agreed he laughed again well it about a fifteen minute walk your arm is going to get tired like that do you want me to let go of your cloak oliver i asked more or less he said fine i said more harshly than i meant it i took my hand away from his arm about a minute later he took my hand i jumped a little i dontwant to leave you too far behind in here oliver said i smiled but he couldntsee that we kept walking for about ten to fifteen minutes i didntlike the narrow walkway much but i was thinking more about where we were going and holding oliver hand oliver stopped suddenly with a muffled sound of pain he had run into something and i had run into him right after that sorry i muttered it ok we re there i looked around quickly i dontsee anything i said after a few seconds because we haventgone inside yet i could tell from the change in the air that oliver opened a door he stepped trough and pulled my arm gently so that i would follow i felt him go behind me and shut the door again but it was still too dark to see anything dan weasley brought me here the year before he died charlie had brought him here first where are we i asked patiently i ll show you lumos oliver wand lit up and he raised the beam of light towards the ceiling not that i could see the ceiling sparkling things were blocking the view it took me a few moments to realize what they were there were hundreds of golden snitches flying around oh my i whispered it s amazing every year the team captain of the house that wins the quidditch cup releases the snitch from that year into this room then he or she shakes the headmaster hand then the deputy headmaster hand and then the head of his house hand and then the hands of the other three heads of the houses i smiled is that written down somewhere yes in hogwarts a history but dan told me first i felt strange sad and happy about being in a place that dan considered important enough to share with others was it ironic that oliver was showing it to me maybe a little but why are they here i mean why do they need new ones every year well the golden snitches can be injured and need to be replaced but mainly it so the snitches dontdevelop biases what i asked laughing a little no one sure why but enough of certain types of charms and spells seem to make inanimate things conscious in some sense of the word golden snitches have so much magic in them they re almost alive other things seem to be like that as well fred and george said that they used to have an enchanted car and ron weasley swears up and down that the car saved potter and him from death personally i think he dreamt it but a car becoming aware of itself and others is possible i didntknow what to say i had never heard of this theory or whatever it was hogwarts probably has this consciousness too oliver added you re saying that hogwarts can think kind of but it may be more accurate to say that hogwarts can feel and acts out of its feelings so the golden snitches start to feel certain ways towards certain houses and they impact the outcomes of the games unless they re replaced frequently exactly oliver said sounding relieved that he didnthave to explain it another way i dontknow how i feel about living inside of something that s kind of human i wouldntcall any of these things almost human maybe they re better than humans in many ways they dontthink they donthave logic they do what they feel like doing they re more free than humans will ever be i was surprised you think about this a lot dontyou i asked i was watching the places oliver wand lit up the room was plain the walls were smooth but were only made up of gray bricks the walls made the snitches look even more beautiful than they already were yes i do oliver said distractedly why d you bring me here i know that you dontcare about quidditch and i wanted you to see it in a way that you wouldntsee as stupid quidditch is more than people flying around on brooms trying to score points or in my case trying to prevent people from scoring points it more than a sport it s an art a lifestyle an obsession it me i ve always been able to count on quidditch i donthate quidditch i said i ve cared about too many people who see quidditch like you do to hate it dan oliver asked almost in a whisper dan and all of the weasleys and you and well most of my friends not that i wait i turned to look at oliver i could barely see him in the small amount of light that was coming towards us why d you ask about dan specifically i said trying not to let any emotion come through i i could be wrong but i figured it out i think did the girls tell you the girls you mean joan and cedar and yes i said no they know they know what i asked that you you and dan i think i dontknow for sure oliver said at last you figured it out i said quietly more to myself than to him it took a dream about him i mean i dreamt that he was the quidditch captain again and you were dating him in the dream when i woke up i started thinking about some of the things you ve said and how you re still really upset sometimes i sorry i said why on earth should you be sorry he asked more kindly than he d ever talked to me before i sorry that it was so obvious i sorry for some of the things i said to you i sorry that he died and i sorry that i never recognized the fact that you cared about him too it wasntobvious i i never thought about the possibility i laughed a little under my breath neither did i until even after it wasntuntil he died that i thought about there being a possibility that we could have been together he was too old at the time i was too young i dontknow there was the age difference that we knew people wouldntunderstand and the age difference made us feel uncomfortable too oliver didntsay anything i sorry again you dontwant to know about i do though oliver interrupted i do want to know he said in that kind voice again i nodded slowly ok i dontknow where to start now though i was just rambling did he know how you felt oliver asked i didnteven know how i felt i still dontknow how i felt he knew that i liked him as more than a friend yes did he i dontwant to pry i feel too nosey don t i think it helps to talk about him and there arentmany people i can talk to about him percy i ve never talked to percy about dan since he died percy doesntknow about dan and i you never told him oliver asked i didntwant to hurt percy any more than he was already hurting so dontworry about prying i trust you i also trust you enough not to use anything i say against any weasley meaning percy ok i wouldn t i wouldnttell you if i didntknow that i just want to make sure i wonttell percy anything you say oliver wasntmoving his wand around the room much now so i lit my own did he feel the same way i dontknow we didnttalk about us much i wish we would have now but at the time i figured there would be enough time for everything to resolve itself i figured we d figure everything out when school started again i told oliver about what dan and i would talk about i told him about how we would argue over most things we started out talking about but eventually i had to get to the part that i needed to talk about and you were there when he had his accident oliver said very carefully i nodded deciding whether i really wanted to tell him what i d been telling myself for three years it was my fault i said quietly slowly what oliver asked standing up we had been leaning against the wall by the door both of us using our wands to look at the snitches flying i looked over at oliver he was looking at me almost like he was scared i was leaving that morning i wanted to say goodbye to him without his family there do you understand i wanted to be able to talk to him and kiss him goodbye but i couldntdo that with the weasleys bustling about helping me get my things together at the last minute i asked him to meet me out in the quidditch field behind the weasleys house we d been spending time out there every day anyway i felt comfortable there i was a few minutes late i couldntfind one of my school books and i was searching ginny room for it i was a few minutes late i d spent four years trying not to think about that morning i d never told anyone the whole truth about what had happened and how i felt about it after oliver i never told anyone else about it i needed another person to know though i needed someone to understand he way lying on the ground when i got there i ran over and his hair was even redder than normal from blood and i tried to wake him up as carefully as i could i checked his breathing and his heart and he was still alive so i sent up large flares and loud noises with my wand which i had with me because i was leaving i still dontknow what spells i cast but it worked mr weasley apparated out onto the quidditch pitch he didntask me any questions ever he just made a stretcher appear and magicked dan onto it we ran back to the burrow we passed the rest of the weasleys about halfway there they followed us back mrs weasley mrs weasley tried to stop the bleeding while mr weasley tried to get help i watched their clock it shows where all of the weasleys are dan was spinning slowly at first and then faster and faster it couldntfind him i dontreally remember anything after that i put a hand over my mouth trying to stop myself from crying even though i knew that it was hopeless once my tears started flowing i concentrated on saying the next part without letting any sobs escape if i d been on time maybe there had been enough time to save him or maybe he d have never fallen at all i shouldnthave asked him to come to begin with i wanted ten minutes with him alone away from his family and i ended up taking him away from his family forever i said failing my battle with my emotions miserably i finally broke down letting all of my weight fall against the wall i i shouldnthave brought this up i knew but i shouldnthave let my curiousity i didnthave to tell you i said composing myself enough to stand up without the wall it not your fault it not yours either he said softly it wasntyour fault he fell accidents happen i wiped tears away from my face still crying although quieter now i know they do i said but i made several circumstances that made the accident possible but it was still an accident laura i knew dan very well and i know that he would never blame you for what happened i ve told myself that for years but i still feel so guilty i said bringing a hand up to my mouth again because i felt another wave of sobs coming and oliver did what was probably the worst thing he could have done to try to stop me from crying he stepped over and hugged me i buried half of my face in his shoulder and clutched his cloak as any self control and dignity i had left disappeared i all but collapsed into sobs oliver kept me up he said that he thought i had probably put this off for too long i didnthear anything else he said and i dontknow if he cried or not now that i ve had truly enough time to reflect on everything oliver was right when he said that i had put off this crying for too long i had cried more than my fair share of tears over the incident but i had never let the feelings go while doing it and honestly it wasntonly guilt about dan death that was making me cry the vast majority of it was but i felt guilty about dan life too i felt guilty that while i had loved dan i had never fallen in love with him i felt guilty that i had never told dan that i loved him when he could hear me i was considering telling him the morning he died but i probably wouldnthave i only told him when he was unconscious and that is something that i never told anyone not even oliver and despite all of this that was racking me with guilt what made me feel the most like a bad person was that this hug from oliver meant more to me than any kiss from dan had after what seemed like forever i finally got enough control that i was barely crying anymore i let go of oliver cloak and tried to brush out any wrinkles there have been that i couldntsee in the dark i pulled back a little self consciously and patted my pockets feeling for my wand oliver bent down and picked up my wand i hadntremembered dropping it he handed it over to me i took it carefully lumos i looked around us to find the golden snitches hovering around us i stepped back towards the wall and gasped a little the snitches scattered quickly see i told you they can feel oliver said quietly i nodded the two of us stood looking at the snitches for a few minutes in an uncomfortable silence i m dontsay you re sorry again oliver said almost strictly i almost started crying again then thank you you know for being there i guess i said quietly my face burning i know i know you lost him too oliver not like you exactly like i did i said he cared about you i know he was a good captain i try to be like him but i can t i donthave the same i donteven know what he had that i cantseem to get i sure you re a good captain too oliver we haventwon that cup yet while i ve been captain your seeker has a lot to do with that potter why we ve won most of our games you taught him he didntneed me to teach him he a natural i never knew what a natural was until i saw that kid fly then you let him do his own thing you let him learn on his own that can be just as hard as teaching oliver laughed you re trying to make me feel better i smiled i owe you that much donti no he said seriously well you may have admired dan but he returned that admiration dontmake up i would never lie about the things that dan told me i said he told me he was preparing you to be the next captain after he graduated he said he saw himself as that captain in between charlie weasley and oliver wood the gryffindor quidditch team would never have seen him like that oliver said i hope not but what does it matter if that how he saw you oliver didntsay anything i smiled at him i waited a minute so he could let that sink in he told me about your pre match rituals he didn t oliver said snapping back into reality i laughed and rubbed my eyes trying to loosen them up from the tears honestly i think it cute he told you oliver asked you really sit in a room and talk to your dad picture oh god he did tell you oliver groaned and then you put on your quidditch robes inside out turn around three times saying smoking is silly drinking a sin i dontdo either so god let us win then you turn your robes back the way they re supposed to be put them on lay your broom on the ground and jump over it by this time oliver was laughing and blushing so much i could see his cheeks turn red in the dim light tell me you didnttell anyone else percy i admitted he groaned that means the whole school must know who would percy tell i asked that wasntvery nice i scolded myself oliver laughed a little more genuinely did dan ever tell you his pre match rituals i asked him to but he wouldn t he would go around the locker room touching the number of every locker in there then he would go to his own locker open it and write down the name of a girl he stopped go on i dontmind i said sincerely you re sure of course i sure i don t if it will hurt you dontworry i only break down talking about his death not his life oliver nodded after a few seconds he said he respected you i smiled i know he respected me oliver no i mean he gave respect to everyone but certain people he respected i dontunderstand isntthere someone whom you would never even dream of being rude to because you look up to them in some way it different than using your manners it respect there one thing he said that i can remember perfectly word for word it was about you and me but the reason i remember it is because i thought he was wrong i respected him like he respected you laura and him being wrong was something i never forgot it lowered my opinion of him he went from a superhero to a hero but being a hero is better it was during my third year i still didntreally have good friends i was hanging around with the other third years but they werentmy friends yet anyway after a practice one night i said something about you that wasntvery nice i dontremember what i said only what he said he said that girl loyalty is so strong she couldntsupport you both it would have been unloyal to both of you so she chose percy percy needed her more than you did wood now either you can prove laura right and be strong like she knows you are or you can keep feeling sorry for yourself i didntsay anything that how daniel saw what i did to oliver by ditching him for percy is that how it was no not really how it was but dan did see the best in people that was the only time that dan ever said something to me that made me want to cry i said i thought hufflepuffs were supposed to be loyal a gryffindor would stand up for both of her friends under my breath i looked away from him and dan laughed what i asked looking back at him a little angrily oliver was smiling which only made me angrier i felt like i was being attacked which maybe in some ways i was but oliver wasntdoing the attacking i was yeah dan laughed at me is that how you see it he asked i responded that it was he shook his head still smiling and said then were you ever really her friend or a friend of her friend when i didntanswer he said because if you really were her friend then yes your comment would be deserved but i dontthink you were i asked him why he didntthink so and how he would know anyway he said because if you earn her loyalty you ll never lose it wood i was crying again silently still not looking at oliver he really said all of that i asked yeah he really said all of that he was wrong i said no he wasn t we never got to be friends in our own rite we were too worried about being percy friend to ever become good friends ourselves we may have been more than acquaintances but we werentas good of friends with each other as we were with percy dan was right i turned to look oliver in the eyes not caring if he saw my tears now hell what did it matter after the scene i d made earlier i remember being friends really really friends he asked i thought for a few seconds i remembered being around percy and oliver all of the time i remembered feeling a little left out because i was a girl everything i remembered about oliver from that time did have to do with percy although the same couldntbe said for percy i remembered things about percy that oliver had nothing to do with maybe not i said slowly but that no excuse for taking percy side automatically now it was oliver turn to think after a few more seconds he shook his head no but it does make us even because i probably would have done the same thing you did i smiled a little i not sure how much logic is behind that because you didntdo the same thing to me but oliver the truth is that i dontreally care anymore i regret everything that happened and i wish that percy and you were friends again but it doesntmatter unlike five years ago i do have you and percy as friends now oliver smiled are you happy now he asked not in a sarcastic or angry way but sincerely what i asked that day in the forbidden forest you didntthink things had turned out well but do you now i think they turned out how they turned out could everything have turned out better undoubtedly but i am happy now good are you i asked he thought a few seconds before laughing i will be if gryffindor wins the quidditch cup i smiled and if not if not we re going to win oliver said i smiled a little more of course you are but humor me if not if not if we dontwin the quidditch cup i have to win that cup laura why i asked calmly because quidditch is who i am we ve had this conversation you arentquidditch you re much more than this sport no matter how you feel about it i see myself as quidditch it all i ve ever been good at it how people see me if i lose that if i lose the person i see as me you lose yourself i guess you can still have quidditch without winning the cup that cup is all i ve ever wanted he paused almost all i ve ever wanted what else do you want he smiled stupid things what a crystal ball i laughed what on earth for just to have one they re you can see things in them only if there something on the other side of the crystal ball and you re seeing the reflections he laughed maybe but i d still like to have one what else do you want my own quidditch pitch a real one i mean like this place and i want a dog a dog i asked yes my parents never let me have one because i at school most of the year but after we all graduate i getting a dog you want a dog a crystal ball a quidditch stadium and the quidditch cup sounds fair enough i think it reasonable except for the quidditch stadium maybe i want one more thing though yes i asked dinner it must be time for dinner by now you re right i said i was a little hungry but i d completely forgotten about the time do we go back the say we came or no we cantget back through that wall in the locker room follow me oliver said reaching out and taking my hand again even though we had wandlight now he walked straight across the room and through a wall with me right behind him we ended up outside of the quidditch stadium i assuming we cantget in that way because that would have been a lot easier i said oliver tapped the solid wall a couple of times to answer my question he let go of my hand and we started towards hogwarts i figured we were going to be a little late for dinner but there was no punishment for that what do you want after we graduate oliver asked when we were about halfway to the castle i just want to be happy whatever it takes to be happy i guess i want oliver didntsay anything that and i want a ken doll i had way too many barbies but no kens it was hard to play house with no kens i just need a ken doll to sit in the basement with the barbies i have no idea what you re talking about oliver said laughing i spent the rest of the walk into the castle explaining about muggle toys he seemed more interested in dolls than i thought he would be when we got to the great hall i went to sit with percy like i did every evening he was almost done eating where were you he asked quidditch stadium i answered already starting to serve myself with wood yes the whole time just about alone he asked no i said i was with alone with wood yes that been hours he said so what will people think he scolded i rolled my eyes percy think of all of the hours i ve been alone with you what do people think about that percy blushed a little that different he said weakly why because everyone knows we re only friends he said and everyone knows oliver and i are friends as i recall it was big news for about half of a day which is much more than enough time for everyone in the building to hear about it and for the second half of that day people were wondering whether it was anything more undoubtedly being alone for hours would only support those rumors what difference does it make percy he my friend but i cantbe around him because the school may think something is going on or i cantbe around him because you think something is going on i didntsay either one of those things i just letting you know how it looks there nothing going on i said sighing percy didntsay anything for a few moments he only stared at me before leaving author note that chapter was much shorter than the last one but there was a lot of information disclosed in this chapter so i wanted to keep it short this is a chapter where i wanted to be more subtle than to just come out and say certain things like in the first chapter i was vague on purpose but please let me know if i was too vague feedback on the golden snitch ford anglia hogwarts theory and anything else is also more than welcome i do think that this might be what is behind the ford anglia personality not necessarily hogwarts or the golden snitches though i think that there a strong case for hogwarts in the real books this would be important to the real books not this story because it implies that hogwarts might be able to feel an alliance with one side if the second war were to have a battle at hogwarts i think it obvious that hogwarts would choose dumbledore side and the always promised cliffhanger coming up in chapter 7 while oliver is busy winning the quidditch cup there no cliffhanger there obviously laura is finally willing to be honest with herself chapter 7 quidditch cup the next few days were normal i worried a little that what i had told oliver would change how he treated me but it didn t however percy and oliver started bickering again perhaps more than they did before oliver said he would stop i just let them go at it i knew that n e w t s were closer than i realized and i was focusing on doing well on them so i could get a good job i wanted to work for the daily prophet and competition over positions there was fierce about five days after oliver had shown me the snitches i was standing in that small hallway that doesntgo anywhere near the entrance to gryffindor tower i was looking out over the lake barely even thinking you re in my spot i turned to see oliver smiling a few feet away i sorry i said i ll leave no i was only kidding he walked up next to me to look out over the lake as well it a great view isntit yes i said turning back towards the window i cantbelieve i never really took the time to look out of these windows in the past seven years oliver didntsay anything i looked up at him he looked calm as he looked out over hogwarts grounds what he asked after a minute not turning from the window i dontknow i answered honestly he smiled a little what i asked i dontknow either he answer laughing i looked out the window and smiled oliver put his hand on the window sill next to mine i looked down and then up into his face again what he asked laughing again and moving his hand away i didntanswer i just looked back out the window after a few minutes i asked have we ever talked about anything good what do you mean i mean we always either talk about that fight or something bad that happened after the fight have we ever talked about something good i dontknow he thought for a minute we ve talked about being friends and about how we never thought that would happened because of the fight i said isntit good that we can talk about bad things yes i answered but can we talk about good things that the true test of friendship isntit anyone can complain we ve talked about good things with the other seventh years yes you re doubting our friendship or oliver started looking a little hurt no i interrupted then what i just want to hear about good things in your life too is all he sighed i getting too girly emotional on you he laughed maybe a little but i ll let you know when it gets annoying then why did you sigh because i not sure if i have many happy things to tell you about i furrowed my brow frowning that what i was afraid of after a few seconds he started talking my parents they re the constant happy thing in my life especially my dad i love mum and everything but she more protective that why i talk to my dad he ll listen and tell me what he honestly thinks i happy when i talking to him i smiled and nodded and what did he honestly think about you becoming friends with me doesntthat qualify as a topic under the fight oliver asked smiling tauntingly yes i admitted ok the constant happy thing in my life is are my parents too i donttell them everything by any means but i do like talking to them they re very supportive i guess most of the time there was a short silence the quidditch match is tomorrow oliver said i know i just didntwant to bring it up if you didntwant to talk about it i admitted i think we can win i know you can i looked up at him and he looked down smiling you arentjust saying that he said of course not your team can win it not like you have to worry about malfoy catching the snitch like you ve been telling us for weeks you only have to worry about harry catching the snitch too soon oliver shook his head no he won t i ve pounded that into his head at least you didntthreaten the poor kid did you no not that my threats should mean anything to him i think he still terrified that a dementor will come into the stadium even though professor dumbledore gave me his word that that would not happen then you ve nothing to worry about i said i ve said that many times that i shouldnthave but this time i saying it oliver brought his hand up towards my face but before reaching it brought his hand down to my arm and brushed at the sleeve of my cloak a few times you asked before if i would be happy if we lost the match tomorrow and i ve thought a lot about it oliver said and will you be happy i asked as long as i have my friends and family i will be happy he said i nodded i glad laura yes lately you ve been a big part of that i mean you ve become a good friend of mine i think and and now that we are friends we always will be i said i smiled i promise he smiled and then nodded he looked out of the window a few seconds before taking a step away from the window i going to go back to the common room ok i said i going to stay here a while longer oliver left me alone to think and in the next half hour i knew what it was when i was looking at oliver i admitted to myself that i had somehow fallen for the person i d hated only months before when i went back into the common room everyone was trying to forget about the match the next day i watched fred and george goof around while oliver sat alone moving figures of quidditch players around a model of the quidditch stadium the next morning i ate breakfast with percy we went out to the stadium together to get seats in the very front they werentthe best seats in the stadium but i wanted to be near the stairs the players eventually came out i took out my omnioculars to look at the players faces they all looked extremely nervous i couldntblame them i was nervous too oliver and flint shook hands and the match began i must say that i was a good fan for the first time in years i usually just watched and clapped a few times during a match during this match i was chewing my fingernails when slytherin was taking a penalty shot and jumping up and down when oliver stopped them i was hugging everyone around when gryffindor pulled far enough ahead in points that harry could catch the snitch i was yelling obscenities at the top of my lungs whenever slytherin cheated and when gryffindor won i cheered even louder than i had yelled i immediately started heading for the stairs to congratulate the players the winning team house always stormed the field after the match i saw oliver hugging harry before heading into the stairway by the time i reached the bottom all of the players were in a group hug on the ground i was one of the first people to reach the team i knew i had to be if i was going to be able to congratulate oliver as the whole team was undoubtedly going to be swarmed by people for hours the group hug was breaking up to welcome friends and classmates into the circle oliver turned away from them and i could see him crying out of pure joy i laughed before coming into his already open arms i squeezed him tightly you won oliver you won the cup i yelled into his ear starting to get teary eyed myself oliver lifted me off the ground and spun around in a circle quickly thanks in part to you thank you he said setting me down again i barely had time to look into his eyes before he was swept up into a crowd of well wishers oliver looked back once before being lifted up on people shoulders i joined the crowd as gryffindor carried its team to dumbledore who gave wood the cup oliver quickly passed it over to harry by now hufflepuff and ravenclaw were on the field as well celebrating the downfall of slytherin a second or third year from one of the houses came up and hugged me normally i d have been freaked out but strangers were hugging all over the field so i hugged her back laughing tell oliver wood congratulations she said letting go of me ok i will i said nodding and tell him if it doesntwork out with you i available she said laughing what i asked i saw you congratulate him it obvious she said moving to a different part of the mob so i spent the slow trip back up to gryffindor common room worrying about how many people had figured out that i didntonly like oliver as a friend i worried whether someone had told him i worried whether it had just become obvious and that some other girl would go after him before i had a chance to tell him tell him was i kidding tell him that i thought i was falling in love with him and scare him away no tell him that i wanted to try to be more than friends because i liked him but if it was obvious maybe he already knew maybe he was purposely ignoring any signs i was giving him whatever those signs were maybes such as these continued to float through my head for about an hour when i realized that i was repeating most of them and it was pointless consciously brewing over them so i thoroughly joined gryffindor festivities fred and george had gotten snacks out of the kitchen and people were lighting off gold and red fireworks which lingered for a long time in the air oliver was the center of the party and was enjoying it i didntlike being near the center of things as that usually where things go wrong so i stayed back with joan who was like me in that sense i so proud of him she said yes i agreed smiling and looking over towards where i knew he was he needed that win yes so what does he need now joan asked i looked over at her confused what surely he cantonly have needed that win what does he need now i shrugged and smiled as much as i could i dontknow a crystal ball she laughed isntit the best friend job to know what he needs i not his best who your best friend joan interrupted follow me she added we went over to a window and sat down on the sill facing the party so who your best friend she repeated perc y i said i scrunched up my brow thinking about the answer that had come to my lips automatically for years was it still true i dontknow if it isntpercy then who is it oliver i said slowly is that bad what joan asked her turn to be surprised by a question i mean does it say something bad about me that someone who i didntlike is now my best friend does that say something about how few friends i have joan thought a few seconds no it doesn t you have enough friends laura for it not to be bad one friend is enough for it not to be bad i think it good i ve enjoyed watching the two of you get used to being friends it was exciting i think i laughed exciting it was rather uneventful as far as exciting events happening it was uneventful yes but it was exciting to see you two make up and forget about the past i wanted that to happen for a long time why i asked honestly more curious than i d been in a while because he always needed you or percy i looked away dontmake me feel guilty again please every time it seems like the fight and the years after it are all we ever talk about when we re talking about the two of us what else would you talk about while talking about the two of you like it or not it happened and like it or not neither one of you will ever be able to forget about it maybe talking about it makes it less important how so you talk about everything in the past tense yes well then you re both acknowledging that it done i guess you could say you re moving on i looked at her a little skeptically she ignored the look do you know what he needs joan asked again i shook my head again no i don t i know now he has everything that he needs joan smiled i think he does too almost what else does he need then it the best friend job to know are you taking on that responsibility joan asked taking on that responsibility i hoping i ve earned it and that he given it to me joan smiled broadly that was very deep laura pretty i think i laughed then i take it back can i be honest joan asked sure you dontwant to be his best friend do you my smile faltered a little that a question not being honest but i already know the answer it is obvious i said frowning now obvious a twelve year old girl i donteven know told me it was obvious i said how embarrassing i dontsee how it could be obvious that you like him when did you figure it out i dontknow i dontwant to talk about this why not because i dontknow ok just let me saw a few things ok if i said no it wouldntstop you i said joan laughed no it wouldn t get it over with then first off i want you to tell him how you feel because i think it will turn out in a way good for you both and i like watching your story i didntsay anything in her pause secondly hey girls you re missing out on the fun joan and i spun in towards the room quickly hello oliver joan said obviously trying to be nonchalant oliver nodded a little looking slightly worried you two arentconspiring against me or anything are you i smiled we were only talking hey oliver good job joan said thanks oliver said beaming with pride we re proud of you she added i nodded my agreement oliver laughed well i can be happy now laura i glad a sixth year girl came up behind oliver and hooked her arm in his taking his hand oliver i lost you for a moment i recognized her her name was ashley putnum she was popular and pretty my smile dissolved quickly just talking to my friends oliver said smiling down at her oh ashley said with a little distaste let go back to the party yeah oliver said he looked at joan and me and smiled slightly i ll talk to you later ok girls joan and i nodded and ashley pulled oliver away i guess he still only needs me as a friend huh i asked quietly joan didntanswer immediately he ll always need us as his friends she said finally and we ll always be his friends i said at least that yes dontworry about her laura i know him she not his type isntshe the quidditch captain and the popular sixth year why not the two best friends joan you donthave to try to make me feel better i have no claim on him and i ve been the friend to boys for years i got used to that right away i chose it joan sighed how do you know what oliver wants i motioned towards the group of celebrators i found it fairly obvious i didn t i see how he looks at you i shook my head i care enough about him to be his friend no matter what and that why he ll pick you pick me i dontneed him to pick me just wait i ve never been wrong about oliver just wait joan got up and walked into the crowd i didntfeel much like celebrating i went upstairs to try to escape the noise luckily i was tired enough that i didntneed to pout over oliver i feel asleep fairly easily author note short chapter my apologizes it was a natural chapter break thank you to all of the people who have been reading this sorry and especially to those of you who have reviewed for those of you who have written your own stories you know how encouraging good feedback or feedback at all can be coming up in the next chapter oliver and percy finally start to take steps to end the five year long fight but how long will their efforts really last and how will laura deal with keeping her feelings to herself chapter 8 gryffindors the next morning i felt a little better i d gotten a lot more sleep than some people and at least a little more sleep than most people also gryffindor had calmed down considerably everyone was still happy but at least i was now able to fake that i was as happy as they were i had slept in longer than normal but it was a sunday so it didntreally matter i got up took a shower and got dressed before walking down to the great hall percy was in our normal place so i joined him morning he said looking up and smiling a little morning i said you dontlook so good percy said i shrugged a little i feel fine something wrong no i lied i smiled it just that the last big game is over we re almost out of hogwarts i decided not to feel bad about making up things because telling percy what was really bothering me probably would have given him a stroke yeah we re really growing up percy said but there a lot to look forward to like work i laughed percy only you would look forward to work percy smiled he was used to my banter on his work ethics there are other things to look forward to like having a family i guess percy tried that makes work sound appealing i muttered percy laughed i agree oh god what i asked turning around to see what he was looking at oliver had walked up behind me hey i didntsee you again last night he said ignoring percy i went upstairs i was tired i said emotionlessly oliver nodded are you ok that what i asked her percy said i told you that i only a little sad about graduation oliver nodded again ok you re sure i think i would know i muttered i know you would know i know you may not tell me the truth as well oliver said smiling can i talk to you later i shrugged and nodded yeah ok see you later then later percy oliver said nodding at him percy nodded back congratulations on the win by the way he said quickly oliver turned back towards us thanks he said a little defensively it wasntvery manly to bawl like a baby though was it percy asked smirking a little i saw you jumping up and down like a little school girl oliver said smiling back percy fought back a real smile thank charlie for fixing my broom oliver said percy nodded i was completely in shock percy and oliver being civil to each other i was dreaming i was surely dreaming right well see you oliver said starting to walk away when you re so close to making up i blurted out i mean a couple of apologizes and dontpush it percy interrupted oliver continued to walk away i sighed i guess i should take what i can get from the two of you i guess even though you would both be happier if you forgave each other not liked each other again necessarily but forgave each other i want you both to be happy i stood up what percy asked i shook my head i just realized something it nothing you realized you want us both to be happy kind of i not really hungry and i have a lot of studying to do for that transfiguration test tomorrow i ll see you later ok perce yeah percy said shaking his head a little later i went upstairs and i did study a few hours later i ate lunch with oliver and company so where ashley adam asked when we were almost down eating oliver shrugged with her friends i assuming and you arentwith her adam asked obviously not as i sitting here with you what was up with ashley and you anyway joan asked looking at me nothing oliver said shrugging a little we were just hanging out last night that it joan asked smiling oliver laughed yeah that it she wanted to be seen with the captain of the winning team and it not as if there was any reason to decline to just play along why just wondering joan said i was in a much better mood after that conversation although i felt stupid for worrying about it but i did learn one thing from the little ordeal there were only a few months left before school was over and other people were interested in oliver i needed to let him know how i felt not that i was looking forward to doing so that afternoon all of the seventh years were sitting around the common room studying for this that and the other and for n e w t s i was tired of studying or pretending to study at any rate i got up and walked over to oliver you said you wanted to talk i asked oliver looked up from his transfiguration book what i smiled you said you wanted to talk i repeated oliver nodded and then looked down at his book again yeah but i dontreally remember about what right now oh ok i said turning to go although whatever it is it preventing me from really studying oliver said i turned back to him maybe it will come to me want to go for a walk i nodded oliver and i walked out of the common room and started walking towards the great hall i know i ve told you this but i really happy for your win i said i know you are that what i wanted to talk to you about he said you remembered quickly then i said narrowing my eyes suspiciously he wasntlooking yeah i wanted to thank you for what just for being supportive even before we were friends but especially recently if i had anything at all to do with our win which i believe i did then you had something to do with our win too if i had something to do with your win then you re welcome i said smiling indirectly it quidditch that i wanted to talk to you about you want to talk about quidditch oliver asked i said indirectly i dontknow enough about quidditch to talk with you about it all right what do you want to talk about oliver asked opening the big oak doors and letting me step through before following me i said and you i added quickly oliver laughed we walked down the stairs and were heading towards the lake before he responded you and me us you and me us whatever i said quickly blushing are you breaking up with me oliver asked laughing i smiled maybe tomorrow i sorry go ahead i know what i need to be happy now i just figured it out this morning i mean i think i ve known for a while but i understood this morning what happened this morning oliver asked you talked to percy without fighting oliver sighed laura if you need percy and i to make up for you to be happy then no that not it i said oliver sighed again more out of relief this time thank god because i was going to say if that what you need to be happy then i would apologize to him i stared at him but it not so i donthave to oliver said as fast as he could no you donthave to i agreed even though i think it would make all of us happier you donthave to apologize to percy please donttry the guilt thing i wasn t you were was it working a little i laughed i sorry we had reached the lake oliver sat down on a big flat rock that was a few feet away from the lake i recognized it as the same rock that i had climbed onto after oliver had pushed me into the lake a few months before i sat down next to him and we looked out over the lake what do you need to be happy oliver asked i need you and percy to be happy i said softly out of the corner of my eye i could see oliver turn his head to look at me that why what i wanted to talk to you about was indirectly linked to quidditch if winning the quidditch cup was what you needed to be happy then i needed you to win that cup for me to be happy why i care about both of you first of all you re my two best friends oliver i said looking at him he was facing the lake again and if you re both happy then i didntdo anything to make it so you couldntbe happy do you understand if you re both happy then it ok for me to be happy oliver looked at me again it has always been ok for you to be happy and it will never be your fault if one of us isn t you ve been a good friend to both of us laura never let what happened between the three of us years ago stop you from being happy it wasntworth anything and certainly not your unhappiness i nodded that was all i could trust myself to do without crying you re sure you dontneed me to apologize to percy if there anything i ve ever needed you to do you just did it i said confident that i could hold back the tears entering my eyes he smiled and you can concentrate on what you re studying now i smiled back who said i was having trouble studying it hard to study when you keep looking up from your notes at me i stopped smiling oliver slid off of the rock and looked out over the water for a few seconds before turning back towards me he held out his hand i took it and slid down the rock to stand in front of him we stood there hand in hand looking at each other for a few seconds before he smiled slowly you said we were gryffindors because we can face life bravely yes oliver laughed a little to himself that a hard thing to do he said again about half to himself do you remember when we were working on a transfiguration project and you made the first attempt to be my friend and i shot you down you said you were what life was facing me against he asked yes i asked getting a little nervous that wasnteasy for you was it he asked what wasn t asking me to forgive you and to be your friend i could feel myself blushing no it wasnteasy but you did it anyway yes how he asked i smiled a little i didntmean to not really i just told myself that what i needed to do and did it before i could stop myself and if it would have backfired it did backfire i said smiling a little more not in the long run in the long run in the long run my pride is still hurting and in the long run it was worth it he smiled why oliver you re starting to scare me a bit are you breaking up with me i asked trying to smile maybe tomorrow he said leaning down slightly and squeezing my hand that he was still holding i saw everything in slow motion i could see him step closer and could see him put his other hand lightly on my waist i could see him bend down to where our faces were at the same level i saw his eyes close and closed my own the kiss ended more quickly than it began but time was going at its regular speed again i opened my eyes oliver had taken his hand off of my waist but his other hand was still grasping mine and there was another awkward stare off but this time i could only stand it for a few seconds something wrong i said i waiting for that to backfire i smiled what i waiting for you to shoot me down i mean that d be fair oliver wouldnti have taken my hand back by now if i was going to shoot you down oliver dropped my hand starting to blush right sorry i laughed i dontthink you understood me i said blushing a little as well oliver raised one of his eyebrows i sighed i i mean well i smiled and looked down at the ground i couldnttell him i loved him because i was still afraid that that would scare him and me and i couldnttell him i liked him liked him because that would sound stupid instead i reached out and took his hand in mine he smiled bent down and kissed me again this time he didntpull away to get my reaction his hand ended up resting barely on my waist again and my hand ended up on his upper arm oliver started laughing and i pulled back frowning you re about to hurt my feelings i said seriously he shook his head it just our position looks like we re dancing i smiled and took my hand off of his arm i just looked at him for a minute yes he asked eventually what time is it i asked casually oliver laughed you re going to hurt my feelings next no percy s i said forcing a laugh oliver raised his eyebrows he likes you is it that hard that isntwhat i meant i was kidding no percy acts too much like he my brother for him to like me but he practically hates you thanks for buttering that up for me i dontbutter things up well maybe percy already knows i groaned i hope not oliver laughed you donthave to tell him i shook my head not telling percy things like this doesntend well everyone else can just figure it out for themselves but i ve got to tell percy how i feel about you oliver smiled before you tell me how you feel about me he asked turning red i smiled back yes oliver laughed you re going to tell percy how you feel about me before telling me yes why it easier i admitted turning to go back to the castle what happened to facing life bravely oliver asked following still holding my hand one step at a time anyway maybe i dontknow exactly how i feel then how are you going to tell percy i shrugged and shook my head i have no idea laura yeah i asked starting towards the castle again what if percy doesntapprove i snorted if oliver let get real when percy doesntapprove right but if he gives you an ultimatum you know if he makes you choose between him and me that kind of thing i sighed i dontthink he will but if he does then it will be a friendship with percy that i ll have to worry about meaning meaning that i wontchoose him over you but i wontchoose you over him either unless he makes me oliver nodded ok i just needed to know that i know after a few minutes we were at the bottom of the stairs that lead up to the front door but oliver held me back i turned to face him there one more thing i need to know oliver said ok when will it be more about us than about us and percy i smiled a little oliver i said slowly no i serious i dontknow a nice way to ask this that ok can there be an us without percy i have to tell him oliver i dontknow why i cantjust let him figure it out but i need to tell him i understand that not what i mean what do you mean i mean can you think about me without thinking about percy i laughed thank god yes i can you can think about me without thinking that it a miracle we re even friends without thinking about the five years we hated each other i didntanswer that what i mean when i asked if it would ever not be about percy oliver our past is our fight our past is getting over that fight has it ever not been about percy exactly oliver said and can that ever change i dontknow i answered honestly i looked down but i want it to oliver let go of my hand and moved his own hand up to my chin lifting my head up so that i was looking at him that all i wanted to know he bend down to kiss me again well that no exactly wha i was expectin to see on the way to me ut oliver and i spun towards the castle to see hagrid walking down the stairs he was smiling broadly looking from me to oliver and back to me again it been a while since i las talked to the two o you i see why what i asked oh no i mean we just oliver started right i agreed hagrid laughed taking one last step to take him down the last three stairs onto the ground yer not in trouble oliver and i didntsay anything we just stood there feeling uncomfortable i always knew you two would end up tergether you did not i said smiling i did jus like i know that ron and ermione will end up tergether when they re old enough to realize that what they want ron weasley i asked i had never really thought about it before i had never really talked to ron we rarely even acknowledged that we knew each other o course hagrid said i knew it the momen the two of em became friends in their firs year jus like i knew it the momen the two of you became friends and during the past five years oliver asked smiling don you see that fight what ya needed to realize how ya felt about each other ya needed to work on yer friendship before ya could ever be more than friends and ya needed a fight for yer friendship to really begin granted i didntthink it would take you five years funny i thought it would take five hundred oliver said he laughed it don matter now yer tergether i smiled and looked up at oliver well the two o you are missin dinner better go on inside ok i said we said goodbye to hagrid and then made our way into the great hall together we acted normally we didntneed the school to know anything right away i going to sit by where percy oliver shrugged well i guess i going to sit by you then we ate dinner like normal i couldnthelp but think about what i would say to percy all i knew was that once percy knew i could try to start the next part of my life author note that my second favorite part of the story for obvious reasons my favorite is the part with the golden snitches and i sorry the story doesntjust end with a kiss there are still conflicts that need to be attended to do you think this story is worthy of being read by other people i hope so if you ve read this far then review if the summary of the story does not lure people in shocking then the number of reviews might and think you could write a tantalizing summary of this story give it a shot i ll give you credit for it just dontgive too much away i cantwrite a summary short enough to show up in the two lines that provides coming up in the next chapter laura has to tell percy how she feels about oliver emotions run high chapter 9 beginning again i went up to the common room before the rest of the seventh years to look for percy but he wasntthere at around ten o clock oliver came over and sat down next to me i looked up from my charms book and smiled i think i going to go up to bed he said ok i said he smiled that it ok not even good night i laughed i sorry i just a little nervous about telling percy he put his hand on mine it ll be fine look at it this way he would never curse you no matter how upset he gets if i were to tell him i d end up in the hospital wing i dontthink you just made me feel better i said i know i was trying to make you laugh and failed miserably obviously i leaned over and kissed him on the cheek thank you for trying good night oliver he stood up and pushed in his chair good night laura he said before walking upstairs i did homework until finally at around 10 30 percy walked into the common room most people had gone to bed early that night which considering the previous late night made sense i stood up and percy looked over and smiled he walked over i need to talk to you i said trying to sound nonchalant i must have failed because the way percy said oh sounded a little apprehensive you ve heard he asked looking happy again immediately percy didntlook truly happy often heard penelope and i are back together again percy said he was grinning from ear to ear that s that great percy i said trying to sound glad i was glad i was also dreading his reaction to my news percy noticed my lack of excitement and smiled kindly dontworry laura i wontabandon you we ll still be friends i nodded of course well we d better be off to bed then no wait i still need to talk to you hell i might as well tell him this when he was happy maybe he d forget to be upset ok percy said the apprehension back in his voice he smiled do i need to sit down i smiled back there were some times when percy made me feel better without meaning to um no it wonttake long ok percy said taking a seat at the table i was working at anyway is something wrong no i just think i should tell you something is all i said again failing to be casual something is wrong percy said frowning now no nothing wrong you i ok what percy asked impatiently there no way to say it other than to just say it i guess i oliver i laughed at myself this is stupid i can tell you i looked at percy who seemed to be getting the gist of what i was trying to tell him anyway we re together now dating kind of dating more together than dating oliver and i i watched as this started to make sense to percy at first i thought he was going to take it very well and i started to feel stupid for thinking he wouldn t why would percy care if i had fallen for a guy he couldntstand and immediately after comprehension kicked in percy emotions kicked in too what percy asked damn so much for percy taking it very well i ve spent a lot of time with him talking to him getting to know him he my friend he one of my best friends and he a good person you know he is you wouldnthave ever been friends with him if he wasn t he made your life miserable percy said i shook my head no we ve made our lives miserable we re as responsible as he is maybe more he s he s oliver wood wood by god by god what i asked getting angry what about dan percy asked turning red dan dead i said and then what he said hit me and what i said hit me you knew i asked quietly you knew of course i knew you thought i didn t dan was my best friend he told me told me that he loved you that he didntcare that you were a few years younger but that he knew mum would because she cares so much about you too i was in shock i felt that pressure in my eyes that means i about to cry but i was too angry for actual tears to come out you knew and you never told me that you knew dontyou understand how much that hurt me that i lost him too and that i couldnttell you because i didntwant to hurt you any more than you were hurting already that i loved him and i wanted your family to know that so you could all know that someone loved him before he died but i couldntbecause the subject seemed to be forbidden percy was furious and sad what was i supposed to say laura i know that my brother was your boyfriend and i sorry that he died i didntknow how to help you and i was in no state to help you anyway and mum and dad knew too mum figured it out i heard her telling dad a few days before dan died she said that she could tell by the way he looked at you during meals dad wasntsure but i think he trusted mum judgment you could have brought it up slowly you could have just told me you knew i said but i was losing my anger percy shook his head and brushed the back of his hand across his right cheek quickly i dontwant to talk about him i dontwant to remember what happened i dontwant to remember what happened either perce but it did happen and i know that i will never forget percy if you think i could ever forget dan i promise you that i won t percy didntsay anything he looked down at the table but i cantspend my whole life remembering i ve got to live for the future and try to stop living in the past like you ve succeeded in doing percy looked at me but still didntsay anything percy i wanted to tell you about oliver and me so that we could talk about it if you wanted to you loved my brother percy asked yes why why i asked yes because he was an unbelievably good person and because he didntseem to know that and because of how much he cared about me and you love wood percy asked i sighed do you percy asked a little harshly yes i said i do percy looked surprised why he asked with even more curiosity i shrugged smiling i dontknow i haventhad as much time to figure out why i just do percy didntsay anything he just started staring off into space after a few minutes i stood up i really am happy that you and penelope are back together again and i sorry if i ruined your good mood are you percy asked coldly still not focusing on anything with his eyes yes i really am i paused good night percy out of all of the boys here i love oliver just like out of all of the girls here you love penelope what the difference you re comparing penelope with oliver wood percy asked focusing on me again i frowned even more than i was before of course not why would i insult oliver like that i asked percy stood up too and i remembered how tall he was he could be a little intimidating when he wanted to be he hadntintimidated me in years and i was too angry to start again now i dontcare what you do if you want to be with oliver fine just dontcome crying to me when he breaks your heart he no better than you at that weasley good night i said as coldly as i could before storming upstairs i was furious but i was also sad and happy at the same time i was so overwhelmed that i wasnteven thinking about being quiet when i entered our dormitory not that it mattered the other girls seemed to be waiting for me they were all sitting together on joan bed and stood up when i entered my emotions were blocked as i stared back at the other girls for several seconds by the time someone spoke all i was feeling was confused we ve got to be right rose said turning away from me and facing the other girls about what i asked in spite of myself i dontthink so cedar answered rose ignoring me i do joan said we re right arentwe she asked me er i knew it rose said in triumph knew what i asked in no mood to be kept in the dark they think that you and oliver are a couple or something cedar said my mouth hung open a little er told you cedar said how d you know i asked ha rose and joan said at the same time while tara laughed what cedar asked after a few minutes of multiple conversations occurring and more confusion i could finally hear all of what joan had to say well it was obvious percy was looking for you but he was the last of us to see you you walked into the great hall with oliver he was happy during dinner while you seemed preoccupied then you stayed in the common room tonight none of us had seen percy come back yet we put two and two together she said i was still surprised that like putting two hundred and two together i said which is still not that difficult plus we heard some yelling just now rose said i didntrespond how did percy react tara asked i raised my eyebrows and shrugged he took it better than i thought he would for longer than i thought he would that bad huh cedar asked i walked over and sat on my own bed are you ok joan asked i ok she looked skeptical are you no and yes i understand she said i don t cedar said your friends donthate your boyfriend joan said we ve never hated your boyfriends rose said no but oliver has joan answered i laughed a little ironic who d he hate rose asked doug livet the ravenclaw keeper i said nodding a little he was good graduated last year i didntknow the two of you dated i never knew oliver hated him rose said doug and i only dated a few times oliver didnttry to hide it from me what he thought of doug though it was nice in some way i guess that he cared mostly it was annoying what d he have against doug tara asked that he was a good quidditch player probably cedar said no actually i accused him of that too doug just isnta very nice person something i learned quickly oliver learned that through quidditch did he say doug would only break your heart i asked how d you know that she asked percy and oliver influenced each other more than either of them know or would ever admit i said oliver got over it before i even broke up with doug i sure percy will no he won t if he can ever ignore it i would probably die of shock i said i looked up god what kind of person chooses a boy over their friend what kind of friend forces that decision tara asked quietly i looked over at her i think i may have done that too joan came over and sat down next to me you arentchoosing a boy over a friend when it comes to percy you went to him right away so he wouldnthear it from someone else probably because you thought you could make him ok with you dating oliver no i said i knew he wouldntbe ok with it i just didntwant to keep this from him like i was going to keep how i felt about his brother from him none of them said anything i tired and confused and i going to go to bed i said standing up to get ready the other girls were more than ready to do the same after all they d stayed up much later than i had the night before celebrating gryffindor victory i had a few problems falling asleep i really had thought that telling percy the truth about how i felt about oliver would make it so i could break away from everything that had happened in the past and start over my conversation with percy made me doubt that hope i was in love with oliver wood but dan was still dead and percy and wood still hated each other i couldnterase the past with a kiss and a confession the past would always be there but i didnthave to let the past keep defining the present i couldnttake away my past but i could give myself a future i decided before drifting off author note i sorry that was a short chapter probably the shortest chapter yet and i afraid i have horrible news this is page 162 out of the 164 pages that i had already written before beginning to post this story i know for the most part what going to happen in the rest of this story it all mapped out on the bottom of the word document that i write this story in now it just a matter of writing down what happens chapters will probably start coming out more slowly especially for the next few weeks i am hoping to get at least one more chapter up before school ends but it will depend on how school is going finals are coming up sooner than i d like i knew that i might run into this problem and to try to prevent this i was going to post chapters less frequently than i did however i couldntresist posting the chapters and receiving your feedback thank you for all of your support and please stay tuned i really want to finish this story and your encouragement will help me greatly thank you all so much bymerlinsbeard in the next chapter laura and oliver adapt to their new relationship
