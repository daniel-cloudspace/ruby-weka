 most hogwarts students could not believe their eyes when they happened to encounter james and lily walking down that hallways engaged in civilized conversation they even seemed capable of working together in class without calling each other names or sending hexes flying in each other directions the teachers appreciated the reprieve from the constant bickering but were unsure what to make of it only professor dumbledore seemed to encourage a potter evans alliance the new relationship happened to be the topic of discussion after a prefect meeting late one night lily and gideon were out patrolling the hallways when gideon decided to bring up the subject so you and james seem to be getting along swimmingly gideon prewitt commented slyly lily started to blush furiously she was getting tired of constantly answering questions about james today alone she had at least five people come talk to her most of the girls they were concerned that james potter was off the market at first lily just laughed at the thought of being in a relationship with james but now she was just getting irritated couldntpeople just accept the fact that they were friends plenty of people had managed it in the past why was it so hard to believe that she and james were capable of civil relationship yes well we have come to a mutual understanding of each other and have decided it is for the better that we stop biting each others heads off lily said well i impressed that you managed to avoid falling for the potter charm for this long gideon said with a wink with this comment lily grew a very irritated look on her face she didntlike james in a romantic fashion and she wished people would stop thinking that she fancied him she thought of him like she did her female friends he was someone she could talk to about her aspirations and that was it his messy hair and arrogant smile still bothered her she knew he still hexed people and baited snape so he was still a git but for some reason it didntbother her as much as it used to and he was taking steps towards deflating his head the thing that had improved most in their relationship was that he had stopped constantly pestering her to go out with him although at times she felt herself missing the attention but she would never admit that to anyone i haventfallen for anything gideon we are just forced to work together on mcgonagall project lily said bitingly yeah that how dorcas and i started out and now we have been together for two years gideon replied with a knowing smile stop it nothing is going on we are barely friends we just tolerate each other and that it lily said coolly unbeknownst to lily james had overheard everything on his way back from detention with filch in a fit of excitement after the gryffindor quidditch team first win over hufflepuff he had accidently set off some dungbombs in the care taker office and had been stupid enough to get caught he had spent the better part of the night polishing the school trophies without magic thank god he had the mirror with him so he could talk to sirius who was busy doing detention with flitwick he had heard lily voice and had decided to hide around the corner from where she and gideon were talking so he could scare her when she passed by what he heard had hurt him and when lily turned the corner and saw his stricken face he immediately turned around and headed straight back towards the common room how could she treat their relationship with such callous disregard he thought to himself he thought they had made progress and that she was actually starting to like him how could she be so cold he reached the common room and went straight upstairs to his room he was in no mood to talk to anyone a fifth year approached him as he made his way across the room and tapped him on the shoulder james i was wondering if maybe you would like to go to hogsmede with me this weekend the girl asked quietly bugger off flora was all he could get out as he pushed past her the girl blushed with embarassment and ran back over to her friends on the verge of tears see i told you he was dating lily another girl said after hearing this james became enraged he was tired of all the gossip why wouldntpeople just leave him alone sirius and remus were busy talking to a bunch of 6th year girls but turned around when they heard james stomp upstairs they turned and looked at each other reckon we should follow remus asked nah let him blow off some steam then we ll see if he wants to talk sirius said as he turned his attention back to the girls james reached his room and flopped down on his bed if she only wanted to merely tolerate him then he would do the same to her no more helping her with transfiguration homework or telling her his secrets he would treat her as if she were any other acquaintance she said she would be there for him and she wasntand that hurt the most back in the hallway lily cheeks burned with embarrassment he had obviously heard her and she felt terrible should she go apologize her pride made her want to ignore the situation but her heart told her to go talk to him she didntfeel the way she had told gideon but she couldntadmit that to herself she actually enjoyed james company and he could make her laugh the way no one else could she wanted to run after him but her pride refused to let her take a step do you think he heard me lily finally asked gideon she just needed conformation that she had made a complete ass out of herself well the expression on james face tells me that he heard you loud and clear gideon said this was a complete turn of the tables usually james was the one putting his foot in his mouth she felt ashamed of her childish behavior should i go apologize lily asked worriedly that depends on what kind of relationship you want with him gideon said seriously with that gideon left lily and headed back to his common room he felt the urge to tell dorcas how much she meant to him seeing james and lily so miserable made him greatful for all that he had lily stood there in shock she thought about what gideon had said and realized she had no idea what he was talking about she wanted to continue being friends with james and that was it she was scared to go back to the common room because she was sure that she would see james there she wasntready to face him she had to think about what she would say to him she decided to go to the heads room to take a bath and relax her tense muscles perhaps there she would get some sort of epiphany about how to solve her crisis she desperately needed to sort out her thoughts the next day james wearily walked down the steps to the common room intending to make his way to breakfast he usually waited for his friends but this morning he just wanted to eat in solitude he was in no mood to be social and listen to sirius ramble on about his latest trist or have remus tell him how he should act he suddenly came face to face with a very worried looking chloe she seemed panic stricken james have you seen lily she didntcome back to the room last night chloe asked this was exactly the situation that james didntwant to deal with he didntwant to have to worry about lily but he did he knew that he would end up looking for her with chloe but it angered him that he cared so much for her and she merely tolerated his presence no i haventseen her lets go look for her james said tiredly when he found her he would give her a piece of his mind and tell her off for being so unfeeling he would tell her off and say exactly what was on his mind he grabbed chloe hand and they quickly exited the room they started with the astronomy tower which was a famous place for people to run off to when they were upset when she wasntthere they tried the potions dungeon the herbology gardens the prefect meeting room the quidditch pitch and finally the dinning hall in hopes that she would have shown up for breakfast when she wasntin any of the locations chloe and james began to panic they had one last place to try but they didnthave the password they found gideon prewitt eating happily with his girlfriend oy prewitt i need the password to the heads room james said irritably hold on james i cantjust give it to anybody gideon said angry at james rude interruption lily is missing and we want to see if she in there james said impatiently with that explanation gideon began to smile he very much wanted james and lily to patch things up and he would do anything he could do to help them along he knew all to well the pitfalls of young love james and lily might be oblivious to their blossoming feelings but he wasn t the password is animagi it was lily idea gideon said james and chloe were off and running towards the heads room thankfully james happened to have a very useful map and he knew exactly how to get there they got to the portrait that protected the entrance and chloe shouted the password the portrait swung open and both sprinted inside the first thing they saw was a sleeping lily she was curled up on the couch and was sleeping soundly james saw this and started to back away all of his courage suddenly disappeared and he wanted to run out of the room and hide just looking at her hurt him how was such a small thing capable of inflicting so much pain on him he didnthave a chance to sneak out before chloe approached lily and then started to yell how dare you scare me like that lily evans you had me up all night worrying about you do you have any idea what i thought had happened to you chloe shouted lily bolted straight up and came face to face with an angry chloe she immediately turned a dark shade of scarlet and felt extreme embarrassment for falling asleep in the heads room calm down chloe i fine lily said grogilly that is no excuse you had james and me running over the entire castle looking for you i was about ready to call the ministry of magic chloe continued lily heart stopped when she heard chloe say james name she looked around the room and saw a silent james standing in the corner he was obviously trying to hide from her her stomach dropped when she saw the hurt look in his eyes lily desperately wanted to apologize for what she had said about him the night before but she couldntfind the words alright lets go get some breakfast i starving lily said after chloe had finished ranting chloe relented and the two girls exited the room and james followed close behind lily didntsay a single word to james during the long walk to breakfast and when the three students got to the dinning room james left and went over to find his friends he couldntbelieve that lily had said nothing to him she had just stared at him and then acted like he hadntexisted she didnteven thank him for coming to find her or for being concerned she was so selfish he thought to himself yet despite all of that he couldnthelp but care about her james and lily didnttalk for the rest of the day they exchanged awkward glances in class and were both thankful when professor mcgonagall didntmake them pair off and work on their projects james was still furious at her and lily pride was getting in the way of apologizing to him that night after lily got back from patrolling the hallways with gideon she walked in to find the common room empty except for one loan figure james was busily working on a piece of parchment for defense against the dark arts he was determined to get top marks on the assignment he took off his glasses and rubbed his tired eye than he ran his hands through his hair messy hair and let out a yawn he started to stretch his arms and that is when he noticed lily staring at him can i help you miss evans he asked coolly i we need to talk lily stammered she decided to suck up her pride and straighten the situation out she wanted to let james know that she hadntmeant to be so nasty she needed to put james straight as you can see i sort of busy right now the whole world doesntrevolve around you james replied flatly lily was a tad taken aback by james less than enthusiastic response to her suggestion she thought he would jump at the chance to talk with her but then again maybe that was the old james she was astonished at how self centered she was why did she think james would forgive her so quickly so she dug her heels in and was determined to win this battle of wills no i suppose it doesn t but i need to explain a few things lily retorted you have nothing to explain i believe you made yourself perfectly clear last night james said please just hear me out lily pleaded if i do will you leave me alone to finish my work james asked he wasntgoing to give in easily he wanted her to show him how she really felt and so he was going to make her work for his forgiveness at his suggestion lily reluctantly nodded her head she had to choose battles she went and sat down next to james and looked him straight in the eyes james found this a bit unnerving but he put his book down and gave her his attention i want to clarify what happened last night what i said to gideon was out of frustration and i said some things i didntmean lily said confidently well that makes me feel a whole lot better here i was thinking we were finally getting along well and you tell prewitt you merely tolerate my presence james said heatedly james you know that isnttrue i well i dontknow what i want to say but i know that you have changed and for the better since your parents deaths lily said there she had said it she had put her foot in her mouth royally and she couldnttake it back she was ashamed at how callous she could be james looked at her in shock his face turned a shade of red and he found himself speechless how dare you talk about my parents after everything i ve told you how can you be so cold james said furiously james that not what i meant and you know it stop twisting my words around lily said too proud to admit her mistake you know something evans you are terrible at apologies james spat out well you are a terrible listener you wontadmit that you did anything wrong because you have such a fat head lily shouted back that is the pot calling the kettle black i haventdone anything wrong and you know it james yelled back well you shouldntbe lurking around in hallways and listening in on other people conversations and you should learn to accept an apology when someone tries to make one lily replied with her fists clinched in anger james looked at lily green eyes that were sparkling with anger her red hair was flowing around her face that had a furious expression on it he almost had to laugh at how she tried to make her petite frame look bigger than it actually was she was fiery and that is what he loved about her she never gave in but this time he was right and she had to know it you never apologized lily you cantdo it because of your stupid pride get over yourself and admit that you were wrong james finally said lily looked at him with great contempt she wouldntadmit that he was right she was tired of him being able to criticize her so correctly never lily growled she turned towards the staircase to her bedroom and marched straight up it she opened the door to her room and slammed it shut behind her she wasntgoing to admit her feelings about james to anyone and especially him she wouldntbe another twittering idiot in the james potter fan club she had let him get too close and she wouldntmake that mistake again back downstairs james head was still spinning from the events that had just taken place he couldntunderstand how she could be so stubborn somehow she had managed to blame the whole situation on him and that impressed him although he hated to admit it she was definitely his match but he was going to let her make the realization on her own he went up to bed and couldnthelp but smile because tonight lily undoubtedly would be thinking about him for the rest of the week lily and james refused to talk to each other both were too stubborn to make the first move this led to both of them being incredibly irritable and almost intolerable to be around lily bit anyone head off who tried to talk to her and james was just as unfriendly he was trying to be patient while he waited for lily to come around and realize her feelings but he was getting tired of her stubbornness it was very frustrating to him that they had come so far and now they were back to the beginning lily would barely acknowledge his presence and when she did she managed to make a rude remark to him or send a jinx in his direction her favorite trick was making him trip in the hallways to everyone else it seemed like everything was back to normal but lily and james were very unhappy the night before the first hogsmede trip lily was sitting downstairs in the common room working on her arithmancy homework every once in a while she would look over to where james was sitting with sirius and remus and she would let out a loud huff she was sure he would have tried to make up with her by now hadnthe asked her out a million times over the last year didnthe care about her at all chloe looked over at lily and began to laugh lily why dontyou just give in and make up with james chloe asked reasonably he an utter toe rag and he needs to be taken down a notch i teaching him not to cross me lily replied evenly well i think you ve taken it too far chloe said lily wheeled around and stared at chloe viciously she was tired of constantly being pestered about james and she wasntgoing to take it anymore she just wanted to be left alone to wallow in her own misery she didntknow why not talking to james bothered her so much but it did however she was too proud to make the first move if she broke down first it would show him that she actually did like him as a friend and that wouldntdo to have james inflate his head over her why dontyou leave me alone and stick your nose in someone else business lily shouted she slammed her book shut and stomped upstairs to get some solitude chloe just sat there in shock at her best friend temper lily had never lashed out at her before and now she knew why some people were scared of her temper across the room sirius and remus looked over their shoulders and saw lily leave the room they looked at james and he seemed oblivious to the world around him he was busy staring at his potions homework james go talk to her remus said no way she needs to figure out this one on her own how would it look if i went and apologized for something i didntdo i canthave her thinking she can walk all over me james said without looking up from his work remus looked to sirius for support he hopped that for once sirius would be sensible and try and do the right thing for his friend dontlook at me i with prongs on this one he didntdo anything and lily is being a stubborn witch sirius said thanks mate james said with a little laugh remus couldntbelieve how thick his friends were fine but dontblame me when both of you end up sad and alone with only each other as company remus said their constant support of each other stupid decisions was starting to get on his nerves he was tired of always trying get them to see the error of their ways he decided to follow lily example and head up to bed the full moon was once again fast approaching and he could feel the monster within him start to grow that same night lucius malfoy and a small group of devoted slytherins decided to meet in their common room lucius scared all of the younger children away so they could have the privacy needed to talk about delicate matters the only people left were snape bellatrix narcissa lestrange crabbe goyle avery and mcnair people he would call his best friends yet he would never trust them with his life the first order of business is to communicate a message to you all that was given to me from the powers above lucius said maliciously narcissa looked at her boyfriend with pride she was proud that he had been deemed trustworthy enough to have the dark lord choose him as the bearer of his messages it was important to her that she aligned herself with someone powerful and she knew lucius was destined for greatness he was everythign she ever wanted handsome intelligent cunning and best of all a pureblood with lots of money she smiled at him and he returned it with a look of desire lucius rolled up the sleeve of his robes and showed his friends the mark on his arm they all looked at it with admiration the dark lord has chosen me for this special sign of loyalty and he wants me to communicate to you all that he will entrust you with this sacred symbol if you continue to show him you are worthy lucius said with a smirk this mark meant that he would be powerful beyond all of his wildest dreams and his aspirations to purify the wizarding world would be realized he held narcissa hand tightly and smiled at his group of friends he definitely chose the right side tell the dark lord i am ready to be entrusted with this symbol of loyalty bellatrix black said with a smile bellatrix black had a demonic disposition and she absolutely loved inflicting pain on those who she deemed unworthy of practicing magic while lucius loved torturing muggles bellatrix prey were muggleborns and purebloods who she called muggle lovers she and her boyfriend rodulphus were one of the most feared couples in school they brought destruction to anyone who crossed them it was a deeply twisted relationship that was based on a sick devotion to the dark arts and to each other snape looked at the symbol on lucius arm and began to shiver had he gotten in too deep there was no backing out now while he was a pureblood he didntshare the same feelings of hatred towards muggleborns what he secretly desired was the power that the dark lord promised to all of his faithful servants he wanted to crush the people who had made him suffer humiliations in the past lucius clapped his hands to regain the attention of his fellow slytherins he had another plan in the works that he needed to discuss he knew they would all be particularly interested in his latest project as we all know a certain mudblood has to be punished for acting above her station lucius said bellatrix and narcissa both nodded their heads while rodulphus began to develop a grin on his handsome but twisted face nobody treats you like that and gets away with it your nose was swollen for a week narcissa said sympathetically lucius didntlike looking weak in front of his peers so he gave narcissa a stern look that told her she would be scolded later she backed down and cowered next to her sister i suggest we make the mudblood pay but we need to make sure that potter doesntinterrupt our plans he seems to have a soft spot for the girl and i dontwant to have him interfere bellatrix spat if there has anything our dark lord has taught us it is how to make someone suffer she will be dealt with lucius cackled evilly he swiftly pulled out a lock of hair from his pockets and his lips curled into an evil grin the group put their heads together and started to plan their attack after much pleading and begging by chloe alice and marlene lily finally relented and decided to go on the hogsmede trip she decided it was her duty as the head girl to go on the trip and make sure that nothing went wrong so early the next morning lily threw on her green sweater a pair of jeans and a scarf to keep herself warm chloe was screaming for her to hurry up in the background she performed a little charm to dry her damp hair and descended the stairs to the common room her five friends were standing their waiting their with her hands on their hips looking slightly irritated at her tardiness alright i coming stop your whining lily said irritably i supposed to be meeting frank for a butterbeer and some shopping and now you ve made me late alice protested as she grabbed the rest of the girls and pulled them out of the portrait hole everyone rolled their eyes in alice direction and started to poke fun at her marlene started to make kissing noises and continued until alice punched her in the shoulder to indicate her annoyance the six gryffindor girls linked arms and headed to the front gates of the castle to hand professor mcgonagall their permission slips she looked at them sternly as she checked the pieces of paper for forged signatures she motioned for the girls to continue on their merry ways and they were soon walking down the path to the hogsmede lets make sure we stop by zonko i definitely need to stock up on some tricks to pay sirius back for charming my hair to look like a rat nest yesterday marlene said and i want to pick up some chocolate frogs for my sister birthday hallie quipped they decided to first visit dervish and banges to pick up some new quills and parchment they walked in the store and an old man glared at them it was a small store that smelled strongly of dust and old books hello boys what can i help you with the old man croaked we arentboys we are girls chloe protested and we would like some new quills and parchment the old man loaded the girls down with supplies and they decided to head to the three broomsticks for butterbeers lily walked next to her friends silently usually she enjoyed her trips to hogsmede but she was not in the mood to deal with students stocked up on candy and chocolates and armed with pranks from zonko joke shop she was in such a daze that she barely noticed when peter pettigrew ran straight into her oh lily i glad i ran into you james wanted me to tell you to meet him at the shrieking shack at 12 he has something important he wants to tell you peter squeaked peter was easily intimidated when he wasntsurrounded by james sirius and remus so when mcnair had approached him and threatened to hurt him if he didnthelp out he could do nothing but agree tell the mudblood head girl to meet your friend potter at the shrieking shack at noon or i will be forced to make your life a living hell i know curses that would make dumbledore scream for mercy mcnair said menacingly peter gave mcnair message to lily with some hesitation but deep down he knew that his friends would not be able to protect him forever and it was not smart to make enemies with the wrong people lily listened to the message and nodded her head finally he was willing to apologize and once he did she would as well she knew she had been acting like a jerk and she wanted to patch things up with him she looked at her watch and saw that it was almost 11 50 she told her friends she would catch up with them later she whispered in chloe ear that she was going to meet james finally was all chloe could say lily separated from her friends and started the long walk up to the house that had long been considered haunted she couldnthelp but feel excited at the prospect of putting an end to her feud with james she actually missed his company and would be glad to talk to him again she finally reached the shrieking shack and opened the door to the falling down piece of wreck that stood before her it was cold out so she wrapped her scarf so it was closer to her body she walked in the room nervously and found james sitting there looking at his watch i thought you might not come he said nervously well i was intrigued by your message and i thought you might have something to say to me lily said cautiously i just wanted to say i in love with you lily evans and i want to be with you forever james continued lily had known james for seven years and he had always been cautious with his heart she thought it was odd that he would just come out and say such a thing to her she was shocked that he felt that way and that he would revert back to the tactics he had used during their fifth and sixth years oh james how could you why did you have to say that lily moaned it was at this precise moment that bellatrix black appeared from the shadows of the room and pointed her wand at lily expelliarmus bellatrix shouted lily wand shot straight out of her hand and landed in bellatrix clenched fist we knew you would come if we offered you a meeting with potter bellatrix spat i told you not to cross us soon crabbe and goyle appeared as well and lily felt her heart being to beat rapidly she was cornered but one thing she didntunderstand was how james sat there and let it happen incarcerous crabbe and goyle shouted together lily felt her body being bound by ropes and soon she could no longer move she tried to scream but bellatrix quickly used the silencio charm to quiet her lily stared at james and was shocked by his behavior he just stood there with his back to her finally he turned around and his usually untidy hair became streaked with blonde and his eyes turned to blue lily sucked in her breath as she realized she was facing lucius malfoy you stupid mudblood you thought you could act as though you were better than everyone else and get away with it potter isnthere to save you now he doesntcare about you because you are cold and pathetic malfoy cackled lily struggled against the ropes that bound her limbs tears slid down her cheeks and she tried repeatedly to summon her wand but it was no use how could she have been so foolish she had let her heart get in the way and now she was in a trap and there was no way out she would be their victim and they would torture her now it is time to pay you silly girl you will learn to fear me lucius continued he took his wand and pointed it straight at her she was afraid of what he would say she didntthink he would be stupid enough to try and kill her but she was sure he was vindictive enough to use the cruciatus curse to torture her she braced herself for the pain that would ensue to her surprise she was lifted up in the air now you listen to me mudblood you stay out of my affairs and leave my friends alone or i will be forced to do much worse lucius said as he continued to let lily float in the air finally with one flick of his wrist he dropped her she plummeted the fifteen feet down to the ground where she landed with a loud thud the world went black and she was no longer conscious she could hear the voices around her taunting her to get up but she couldntwill her eyes to open she lay on the ground motionless the door to the shrieking shack flung open and james came sprinting in to the room with his wand at the ready when he saw chloe and the other girls at the three broomsticks and asked where lily was chloe had told her he barely stayed to listen to her finish the story heknew it was a slytherin plot and had raced the half mile to get to the shrieking shack as soon as he could sirius and remus tried to follow but james was a quidditch player and in much better shape he soon lost them as he was driven by his anger and fear for lily safety he burst in the room and saw lily unconscious on the floor and immediately ran over to her he prayed that he was not too late he managed to get in front of lily body just in time crucio lucius yelled james was hit squarely in the chest with the curse and immediately felt pain that no one could possibly imagine his head felt as if it was about to explode and every part of his body was hurting he let out a scream he had been hit by the curse that was intended for lily sirius and remus opened the door to the room and immediately sprang into action expelliarmus they shouted together as they took on lucius accomplices wands were flying across the room as the battle ensued they managed to disarm all of the slytherins but lucius bellatrix was in a full body bind on the ground and crabbe and goyle were immobilized by remus and were now cowering on the floor you idiots lucius screamed i cantcount on you to do anything right james body was lying motionless on the floor next to lily s sirius ran over to his friend and tried desperately to revive him professor mcgonagall accompanied by professor flitwick threw the door open chloe marlene and alice were close behind lucius quickly dropped his wand and let james go from his curse chloe saw lily body and let out a scream she ran straight over to her best friend and put her head in her arms never in my years as a teacher have i seen such an appalling attack on students report straight to dumbledore all of you she shouted to the slytherins she conjured stretchers for lily and james and had chloe marlene and alice accompany them to the hospital wing to be tended to mcgonagall turned to where remus and sirius were standing the boys immediately began to explain themselves to escape possible expulsion professor we got here as quick as we could but all we saw was lily and james lying on the floor unconscious so we disarmed the slytherins remus explained hurriedly that the honest truth mcgonagall looked at the two notorious troublemakers and pointed them in the direction of dumbledore office he would know how to sort out the incident with all of the commotion no one knew that lucius malfoy had used one of the unforgivable curses on james professor flitwick took the four slytherins along with sirius and remus to the headmaster office professor dumbledore came down the staircase to greet the students with a grave face first he took the slytherins inside his private quarters to discuss the incident they maintained that they were merely defending themselves and that lily and james had baited them into meeting them at the shrieking shack and then attacked them upon their arrival it was not their fault that they happened to get the better of the head girl and gryffindor quidditch captain lily stunned crabbe and goyle and so i had to disarm and disable her and bellatrix was merely a bystander lucius said casually then potter tried to attack me from behind and luckily i was able to prevent him from doing so professor dumbledore listened attentively and as he had no other witnesses to say otherwise he let the slytherins go with a month detention the old fool is so blinded by his emotions that he cantsee what is right in front of him that was brilliant lucius bellatrix said with a smile as they left the room she gave a wink to her cousin and his friend as she and her friends continued to laugh about their exploits sirius and remus faces turned a deep shade of red with anger dumbledore came to fetch them and when they entered his office they tried their best to recreate what they had seen upon entering the shack they told professor dumbledore how lily had initially went to the shrieking shack to meet james upon his request but mysteriously james had never made such an arrangement they were fighting professor why would he want to see her he was with us during the entire trip until chloe stepford told him where lily had gone sirius argued dumbledore nodded his head and thanked the boys for their help he told them not to worry and that all the wrongs would be put right dumbledore knew something was amiss and that a simple student quarrel rarely led to two very astute pupils being rendered unconscious lily was a dueling champion and james was at the top of his class if a proper attack had taken place he had no doubt that they would have defended themselves brilliantly however he had no proof of misconduct on either side and thought that the best thing would be for both sides to serve detention and move on with their lives dumbledore didntbelieve in harsh punishments he knew all too well that they only created resentment and anger which could lead to terrible things at the same time in the hospital wing james potter slowly opened his eyes and when woke up he found a pleasant surprise an i hope everyone likes it i got nothing accomplished today because i worked on it for so long please read and review and tell me what you think a good review will definitely make me update sooner its been fun james felt as if he had been hit by a ton of bricks his entire body ached and every limb of his body cried out in pain he tried to open his eyes but all he saw was darkness he knew the feeling all too well because it was the same pain he had experienced when voldemort had hit him with the cruciatus curse yet he thought that lucius had only stunned him malfoy wouldntbe stupid enough to use an unforgivable curse right under dumbledore nose he tried once again to open his eyes and when he did he was instantly hit with a blurry painful light he continued to open and close his eyes until he could properly focus on the room around him the hospital wing was draped with white curtains surrounding the many beds that held students suffering from many different ailments over the years it was impeccably clean and it smelled extremely hygienic james tried to sit up to absorb his surroundings but found that when he tried to move his body the pain only worsened however when he opened his eyes for the last time he caught a flash of red he looked down towards the foot of the bed and there sat a sleeping lily with her head on his lap he desperately wanted to reach down and stroke her hair and kiss her sleeping face but he knew that would result in a big slap across the face so he decided to take the gentlemanly route he let out a little cough to let her know that he was awake then put on the cutest groggy face he could to make it look like he had just woken up lily heard james start to stir and she pulled her head up and looked at him after being quickly revived and receiving treatment for her bumps and bruises she had been waiting for hours to see if he would wake up madame pomfrey had insisted that she stay the night in her own bed back in gryffindor tower but lily refused to leave james side she knew what james had done for her she was still conscious enough to hear him take the blow when lucius had tried to curse her she didntknow what he had been hit with but she new he had saved her she needed to tell james that she was sorry and that it was all her fault she was the one who had been stupid enough to fall in to the trap and it was her fault that he was lying in the bed in front of her she didntknow exactly how she felt about james but she knew that she needed to apologize and be in his life again after several moments of silence lily decided it was her turn to finally speak how are you feeling lily asked quietly alright considering i was attacked james replied as he rubbed his throbbing head what are you doing here i thought you werenttalking to me lily hated the way that james always read her mind he knew why she was there but he wanted to get her to admit it and that bugged her he always forced her to be truthful about her feelings and it was a new experience for her she had never been pushed to her emotional limits by anyone so she sucked up her pride and decided to let her feelings take over she jumped up from her chair and threw her arms around james oh james i am so sorry this is all my fault i am a terrible person lily sobbed james couldnthelp but be shocked by lily sudden outburst he started to smile as he looked down at the crying red head she was soaking his shirt with her salty tears and he never wanted to let her go lily looked up at james and felt terrible for making such a spectacle of herself lily i fine really it not your fault i have a knack for getting myself in to tight spots i happen to enjoy being in danger and especially if i get to do it and help a pretty girl at the same time james said with a grin lily dried her eyes with her sleeves and started to smile james could always make her laugh oh dontbe so arrogant i trying to tell you i sorry and you cantstop talking about how wonderful and chivalrous you think you are lily joked she hit him playfully and he pretended to act like he was hurt he was trying his hardest to not pin her and cover her with the kisses he was desperate to give he had always thought that she was the most beautiful when she was upset ouch that hurt i still recuperating here james said with a pout you are impossible potter lily continued to chide ok what is so important that you are keeping me from resting up james finally relented lily went and grabbed the chair she had been sitting in and pulled it next to james head so she could be face to face with him she looked straight into his hazel eyes and suddenly felt at a loss for words he looked at her as if she was the only thing in the room and that unnerved her she was determined to say what she had been feeling for the last week he needed to hear her out james couldnthelp but smile at the nervous girl in front of him she was looking down at the ground and was not about to start talking so he decided to help her along come on evans spit it out i donthave all day madame pomfrey is going to come back soon james said ok listen to me i need to tell you something and it not easy i dontlike being wrong and i hate admitting it when i am that is just something you are going to have to get used to if you want to be friends with me but when i talked to gideon about you i was wrong i was scared to admit that a person i have spent the better part of six years arguing with and competing against was someone who was becoming important in my life you are going to have to be patient with me but i do want you in my life and i want to be a part of yours lily said she took a giant breath because she hadnttaken one during her entire speech she wanted to get it out and quickly she tried desperately to read james face for a response she could only pray that she hadntruined things with him and that he still wanted her as a friend lately she had been doubting whether he still thought about her at all james looked at lily and his mouth hung open in shock he didntknow what the correct response was he tried to think about what remus would do in this situation because he was sensible when it came to women he couldntmove too fast because that would only make her mad he was confused about where he stood with her but she wanted him in her life that was a huge step forward and it was much better than being told to shag the giant squid did my ears deceive of did miss lillian evans apologize to me i think hell must have frozen over or i have died and gone to heaven james replied with a smirk lily took a pillow from the bed next to her and shoved it in james face she started to laugh and he reached up and grabbed her and started to tickle her mercilessly lily started to laugh uncontrollably and madame pomfrey came over to james bed and scolded them for being so disruptive miss evans please mr potter needs to rest you are free to go just apply that ointment to your wounds and you should heal in no time madame pomfrey said sternly she went back to mixing potions and left james and lily to their own devices what wounds lily did he hurt you james said seriously he would rip malfoy and his little cronies limb from limb he felt anger begin to rise inside of him oh it really nothing it could have been much worse if you hadntcome along i just received a few bumps and bruises when malfoy dropped me from fifteen feet in the air lily said calmly james fists started clench and his face turned a deep shade of red i wontlet them hurt you ever again james said his voice filled with rage calm down james i perfectly capable of taking care of myself if i want to be an auror i just going to have to toughen up lily said with a smile she didntwant james to do something stupid she knew he was prone to acting on his impulses and she didntwant him to do something he would regret james had to admire her bravery but he still wanted to protect her from experiencing the pain he had she got up from her chair and told james she would see him back in the common room she had some homework to make up and she wanted to let james rest thanks for worrying about me lily james said quietly someone has to and i know remus sirius and peter are probably too busy planning to prank malfoy into the next century for what he did lily said with a laugh she left the room and was greeted by professor dumbledore on his way to visit james ah miss evans i was just coming to see you perhaps you can clarify the events of this afternoon for me dumbledore asked politely i walked into the room after receiving a message from peter pettigrew that james wanted to meet me and i was attacked by lucius malfoy bellatrix black crabbe and goyle lily said evenly how did mr potter manage to become involved professor dumbledore inquired well as we all know mr potter has a pension for heroics and i dare say that he was trying to save me upon hearing of my whereabouts lily said sarcastically chloe had told her how the slytherins had gotten off with only a month of detention and she was furious at dumbledore for believing their outrageous story she wanted to scream at him there is nothing i can say to make the event disappear but perhaps things happen for a reason professor dumbledore said wisely he winked at her and continued on his way to the hospital wing lily couldnthelp but think dumbledore had finally lost his mind he had ignored the truth that was staring at him in the face he had let four future death eaters go without so much as blinking an eye she had never shown him anything but loyalty and now she felt betrayed yet somehow she felt as if he knew something she didn t the other question on her mind was how peter pettigrew was involved he was one of james best friends he couldnthave been involved in a slytherin plot against her she hoped that he was merely passing on message he had heard from someone else she couldntbelieve that he would betray james james tried to close his eyes and rest but he couldntwipe the grin off of his face lily wanted him in her life and that was like christmas had come early his foot was in the door and now he just had to show her how right they were for each other his thoughts were interrupted when professor dumbledore peered down at him from the top of his half mooned spectacles mr potter we must stop meeting like dumbledore said with a smirk i definitely have a knack for landing myself in the hospital i guess that is just what fate has in store for me james replied you have shown yourself to be quite worthy in dangerous situations mr potter but please do not be foolish take care of yourself dumbledore advised professor dumbledore why would i have been knocked unconscious by a simple stunning spell james asked curiously he didntwant to think that he was too weak to withstand a spell he would be facing almost daily once he became an auror the pain he felt was similar to what he had experienced under the cruciatus curse but he doubted that malfoy had used it on him that is a mystery james but i can only advise that things arentalways as they appear and that loyalty is what counts dumbledore said simply james felt unsatisfied with dumbledore answer but he was too tired to protest madame pomfrey sleeping draft was starting to kick in and he couldntresist the temptation to rest his eyes and let the pain inside his head subside he drifted off into a blissful dreamless sleep lily walked into the gryffindor common room and was immediately bombarded by sirius remus chloe marlene and alice sirius hushed the rest of the group as he led lily to one of the big red couches is he okay sirius asked quickly lily stared at the roaring fire and couldnthelp but smile she was exhausted and only wanted to go to bed but she decided to answer her friends questions first james is fine sirius he was about to get some rest when i left but thanks for asking about me lily joked chloe hit sirius hard in the stomach for being so insensitive sirius glared at her but when chloe shot him a look of disgust he backed down and tried his best to give lily a sympathetic look did dumbledore say anything more about what going to happen to the slytherins alice asked lily looked down at the ground and began to feel rage building inside of her i think they got away with a month detention remus said trying to make the inquisition easier on lily she gave him an appreciative smile sirius stood up and had a manic expression on his face remus knew the look all to well because it was the one he had when he was planning something oh they will be punished i will make them pay sirius said crazily sirius calm down dumbledore has his reasons for how he dealt with them remus said wisely sirius sat back down and remus put a supportive hand on his shoulder for once in her life lily found herself agreeing with sirius she was never one for revenge but she wanted to get the slytherins back for causing her and james so much pain and humiliation dontdefend dumbledore in front of me he betrayed me by letting them go lily said viciously dontsay that lily he is the wisest wizard of our time and he has shown us nothing but compassion chloe said upset at lily accusations lily was tired of everyone talking at her she desperately wanted to get some rest she didntwant to answer anymore questions she let out a loud yawn and started to stretch her arms sirius gave her a look then stood up and said he was ready for bed he suggested everyone else do the same there would be many days ahead to dissect exactly what had happened in the shrieking shack lily found herself realizing why james considered sirius his best friend at that moment he was a god send and she wanted to kiss him for being such a saint everyone left the room and made their way upstairs lily and sirius were the last people left and she mouthed a quick thank you to him he shrugged his shoulders and gave her his infamous black grin he was halfway up the stairs to his room and then he looked over the railing and saw lily pull herself up off the couch he cares about you do you know that i ve never seen him so worried when he thought you were in danger sirius said casually so donthurt him lily could only return a weak smile she was amazed at the amount of loyalty james and sirius had towards each other she only hoped that her friends cared as much for her behind all of the practical jokes and their cocky demeanors sirius and james were loyal and brave and she only hoped that she was the same dontworry sirius i won t lily managed to get out sirius finished walking up the stairs and entered his room lily let out a giant yawn and stretched her aching body she pulled her hair back into a ponytail at the nape of her neck and let a tear fall silently down her cheek with everything that had happened she hadntfound time to really absorb what had happened to her she cried because this was the world that waited for her after school it would be a place that would divide people who were once school mates and force them to fight to kill each other she cried for the friends she would lose and the hard decisions she would have to make she could only wonder how many more times she and the ones she loved would suffer before the madness could end the attack was just a glimpse of her future and that terrified her the most yet she had to be brave she knew what side to choose and she would have to stand by that she went up to her room and silently got undressed and put her pajamas on she slipped into bed and fell asleep quickly she drifted off into a deep sleep and soon she was dreaming she saw a woman who she could only assume was an older version of herself sitting in a small but cozy room she was rocking a tiny baby back and forth he had messy black hair and emerald eyes she heard a familiar voice in the background ask her a question the baby began to cry and lily tried to hush him back to sleep thanks james you woke him up lily saw herself saying the baby finally quieted down and she laid him down in his crib he was sleeping peacefully and lily watched him lightly breath she started to sing a song that her mother had sung to her when she was younger hush little baby dontyou cry she sang all of a sudden james burst through the door with his wand at the ready the baby started to cry james came over and kissed lily passionately he here lily take harry and go i ll try and hold him off james said urgently lily lifted the baby out of his crib and quickly kissed james on the lips she sprinted out of the room she couldnthelp but feel as if she would never see james again a flash of green light went off as she ran with the baby in her arms she heard a dark laugh and she knew that james was dead lily sat straight up in her bed and her head was dripping with sweat her heart was pounding in her chest what had she just seen was it a warning of what would happen in the future and who was the baby and why was she kissing james her head was spinning with thoughts she desperately wanted to see james and tell him what she had seen but he was in the hospital wing and she didntwant to disturb him she finally laid her head back down on her pillow she was afraid to close her eyes because she didntwant to have the dream again she looked around at her sleeping roommates and started to feel very alone she stared into the darkness and waited for morning to come an ok more stupid technical difficulties i could drop kick my computer right now so i trying to upload this chapter one last time and it better work sorry for all of the confusion anyways i hope everyone likes this chapter not much happened but it was necessary in the overall building of the relationship so please read and review it ll give me more of a motive to write the next chapter thanks for all of the great reviews of last chapter i new to this so any advice or help is greatly appreciated between classes studying and extra curricular activities the seventh year students barely had time to rest james found himself at quidditch practices most nights training his team for the upcoming match against slytherin sirius was out to impress and flirt with every girl at hogwarts so he was never around remus constantly had his nose stuck in a book and peter was on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being yelled at from most of his teachers about his abysmal grades lily felt as if she hadntslept in months when she wasntin class or doing heads duties she was catching up on studying which left little time for sleep let alone social activities she was running herself ragged and at the same time trying to fill out her auror application she was in such a rush that when she finally reached the library after a long day lily almost crashed into an unsuspecting hufflepuff second year her books fell out of her arms and she hit her leg on a table she heard laughter in the background and turned around to see a rather amused james grinning at her you re late lil and to think i ended quidditch practice early to be here on time where are your priorities james said in between chuckles stuff it i had to break up a fight between a couple of younger slytherins and ravenclaws then i had a prefect meeting and after that a career advisement with mcgonagall plus i have patrols after this so save me the lecture and lets work on this silly project lily said irritably long day james asked sympathetically you have no idea i could kill gideon for being so unhelpful and he cantgo on patrol tonight so i have to go by myself his excuse is that it his girlfriend birthday how lame is that lily said as she pulled her transfiguration books out of her bag and placed them on the table i can go with you on patrol if you want james offered helpfully lily looked at james and gave him a smile she desperately needed help and she would take it from anyone who would give it even if that was james she had been getting along extremely well with james lately although they hadntseen much of each other they had been working together on the project for transfiguration at any free moment they could get and had managed to not get in to too many arguments they had started eating together at meals every once in a while and last week james had even included her on a late night kitchen raid with the rest of the marauders unfortunately they all couldntfit under the invisibility cloak so james and sirius opted to risk it and filch caught them red handed with glasses of pumpkin juice and pockets full of sweets they had served their detention dutifully but lily couldnthelp but feel bad for causing the problem oh could you that would be amazing it gets so lonely walking the dark corridors all by myself lily pleaded james jumped at the chance to spend some time with lily and thought it would be fun to bust young troublemakers in the making he quickly agreed to join lily on the patrol and they set to work on their transfiguration project they had decided to show the class how to transfigure a miniature model of a quidditch pitch it had been james idea since he was obsessed with the sport but lily had come up with the genius idea of turning golden coins into players so a small game could take place attention to detail was key and it had taken almost three weeks to get the stadium and pitch looking just right they were finally onto transfiguring the players and equipment so the game could take place james couldnthelp but laugh when one of his coins turned into a small player and took off flying around the room and crashed right into madame pince drink it was nearly 10 o clock when they decided to call it a night and begin lily rounds they left the library and began roaming the dark and cold hey want to go to the astronomy tower and catch people making out i do a great mcgonagall impression that would really freak the younger kids out james suggested stop being so immature i cantabuse my powers and anyway the astronomy tower is no longer the fashionable place to snog most students have moved to the herbology greenhouse but i thought you would have known that with your reputation with the female population at hogwarts lily said sarcastically james started to laugh at lily accusations the truth of the matter was that he only had eyes for one girl and she was standing right in front of him yes he had visited the astronomy tower a few times but those trips were mostly to drag sirius arse back to the common room so he wouldntget detention do i detect a hint of jealousy in your voice you ve got me pegged all wrong sirius is the true player i just have natural charisma and good looks that make the women flock to me but i am a gentlemen and would never take advantage of them james replied with a grin i see you donthave a self esteem problem if you are such a gentleman then how did it happen to pass that you were caught with kristen delamore in a broom closet last year lily asked with a triumphant smile she was merely looking for cleaning supplies and i decided to assist her in her efforts it was purely innocent i assure you james said why the sudden interest in my love life anyway evans i remember plenty of times when you told me to shag the giant squid lily couldntbring herself to respond she didntknow why the idea of james and another girl bothered her she tried to convince herself that james could snog anyone he pleased they were friends and the idea of being anything more with him was out of the question he still thought way too highly of himself and drove her crazy with his constant messing with his hair i could care less who you fancy james i just dontwant to be the one who catches you lily finally said james couldnthelp but laugh because he knew lily wasntbeing truthful she just couldntadmit it to herself he was sure that he was slowly winning her over however he decided it was not the time to press her about her feelings he was willing to wait well dontworry i haventfancied anyone this year or made any trips to the broom closet but i would watch out for sirius james said with a smile yes i have noticed you seem to have taken a break from the dating scene have you run out of girls to annoy lily said playfully well no one is as much fun to annoy as you lily but to answer your question i getting tired of it all its just not as much fun as it used to be james said seriously now enough about me what about you any boys in your life james asked with a grin well severus snape and i have been engaging in a passionate love affair lily joked ugh that not even funny he could suffocate you with all of that grease james said they continued to patrol the halls and james had quite a bit of fun when he got to scare the living day lights out of two third year slytherins who were roaming around the halls he hid around a corner and when the walked by he jumped out and both let out blood curdling screams james and lily couldntstop laughing for hours as they did impressions of the two students jumping out of their own skins at midnight they decided to return to their dormitories and get some much needed sleep they started to part ways when james turned around and grabbed lily by the shoulder are you going to the quidditch match this weekend he asked quickly lily looked at him and he seemed nervous his face was flushed and he seemed to be breathing rather heavily i thought i would use the time to get some work done seeing as i am so far behind lily said nonchalantly oh come on please come watch me play it would mean a lot to me if you were there james said intently ok fine but if i fail my newts and dontget into auror training i blaming you lily joked james gave her a big hug and then went upstairs to his room to get some sleep lily was left standing there with a bewildered expression on her face why was it so important that she go to the game and why had he been so nervous to ask her to attend the questions continued to role around in lily head but the fatigue set in quickly and she decided to get some much needed sleep that saturday james woke up early and looked outside the window of his dormitory although it was barely light out he could tell it was shaping up to be a beautiful day for quidditch he tried to wake up his mates but all he got was grumbling and death threats sirius even managed to throw a punch in his direction oy you giant prat it six in the morning leave me alone or i will make it very hard for you to have children some day sirius said angrily peter and remus couldnteven be bothered so james was left to think about the upcoming match by himself the slytherins were going to be their greatest competition and he knew they had put together a very strong side malfoy unfortunately was an excellent chaser because he was such a bully on the pitch but james knew he was a better flier and seeker than rodulphus lestange lestrange didnthave the patience to learn the finer arts of seeking and his usual strategy was to follow his fellow seeker around the pitch until he found the snitch and then he would try and bump his opponent of his broom james would just have to out fly lestrange james could feel his stomach growling but breakfast wouldntbe ready for a couple of hours he decided to occupy himself in the common room to take his mind off of the game he put on a pair of jeans and a t shirt and decided to leave his dark room and head downstairs to the common room where he wouldntget yelled at for showing his excitement for the upcoming match he plopped down on the big red couch in front of the fire and started to tie his shoes he found a copy of a recent quidditch magazine and decided to flip through it to pass the time he was interrupted when he heard a door open on the girls dormitory side and he looked up and saw emmeline vance an attractive fifth year prefect she was tall and slender with golden blonde hair and piercing blue eyes she had had her eyes on james for months and she thought it was the perfect opportunity to show him that she was interested james on the other hand had hoped that it was lily who was up so early so he was a bit disappointed when emmeline came and sat down beside him are you ready for the game today edgar was telling me that the slytherins are going to be a rough fight emmeline said with a smile she batted her eyelashes and put a flirty look on her face james was oblivious to emmeline advances and he continued to stare at the magazine in front of him you are a brilliant seeker so i have no doubt that we will win emmeline continued james ego got the better if him and he was so excited for the game and emmeline was the only one around to talk to so he took the opportunity to give her his analysis of how the game should go he wrapped up his assessment of the game with him grabbing the snitch he stood up and did a demonstration of how he would pose for the winning grab she clapped her hands at his brilliance and let out a shriek of delight when he showed her his final move james sat back down next to her and drew her the attack formation he was going to use against the slytherins he was so busy making the diagram that he didntnotice when emmeline laid her head on his shoulder she started to nuzzle into his neck yet james was oblivious to it another door opened from one of the girl dormitories and lily walked out she was dressed in gryffindor colors with a red sweater on and she held her striped scarf in her hands she pulled her dark red hair back into a ponytail and started descending the stairs she heard giggles and looked over towards the couch and saw emmeline with her head on james shoulder and he didntseem to mind they looked very cozy together and lily felt her stomach drop emmeline had her arms around james and he just sat there and to lily it looked as if he was enjoying the attention emmeline looked over james shoulder and saw lily and gave her a little wink lily just stood their frozen in place james continued to look down at his diagram intently and wasntaware of anything around him formations and flying tactics were swarming his head and he didntnotice that lily was staring daggers at him or that emmeline was practically sitting on his lap come watch me fly today emmeline and i will show you what i was explaining earlier james said as he put the finishing touches on his drawing lily let out a huff and stomped towards the portrait hole so it had meant nothing when james had invited her to come see him play it was just something that he said to all of the girls james turned around just in time to see the back of her head as she left the room he attempted to call out to her but it was no use lily ignored him and refused to look back the idea of emmeline touching james made her walk even faster she wanted to run away from the scene she had just encountered how could he like emmeline she thought to herself she was a nice girl and a very talented witch but she wasntright for james back in the common room james continued to stare at the door and couldntunderstand why lily had ignored him he looked back at emmeline and she got up and gave him a smile she said she would see him at the match and james waved goodbye ok well i ll see you later james said sheepishly sirius and remus had watched the whole scene from the top of the landing and knew that james was in trouble they walked downstairs and james was still staring intently at his diagram he needed a way to draw the slytherin beaters away from his best chaser and he was still in the dark about how to do so hey prongs i didntknow you fancied emmeline sirius said matter of factly what why would you think that i was just showing her my offensive lineup for the game today james said completely caught off guard by sirius suggestion you two looked pretty comfortable with her all wrapped around you remus chimed in james felt a pit begin to form in his stomach was that the reason lily had seemed so upset when she left the room he hadnteven noticed emmeline how could he have been so blind she was what oh shit did you guys notice if lily saw us james said frantically because she walked out of the common room with a look on her face as if she had seen a ghost yeah she stared at you two for a good three or four minutes and you were too thick to notice she was there remus said she did seem pretty cross when she left sirius commented james just put his head in his hands and let out a grunt of frustration he felt so stupid he hadntmeant to flirt with emmeline and he definitely didntnotice that she was making advances towards him he would just have to explain it to lily come on mate lets go get some grub and you will feel a lot better dontworry about lily she will come around just focus on the match if we lose to slytherin i will be forced to hang myself sirius said as he put an arm on james shoulder peter soon joined the three boys and they were on their way to the dinning hall james entered the room and saw lily talking with chloe and marlene there was an empty seat next to her so he decided to take it he thought it would be a perfect chance to explain himself lily saw him take a seat and she continued her discussion with her friends she continued to ignore james for at least fifteen minutes finally the girls stopped talking and james took the opportunity lily about this morning i sorry james tried to say but lily put a hand up as if to stop him you donthave to explain yourself potter as i told you last night what you do is your own business and not mine lily said shortly she turned to chloe and they went back to talking about the charms test they had next week james was taken aback by lily cold attitude so he decided to get up and join his friends at the other end of the table they looked at him and knew it hadntgone well james ate the rest of the meal in silence and when breakfast was over he headed straight to the gryffindor locker room he needed time to clear his head before the match the rest of the team finally entered the locker room about an hour later the three chasers amanda bones edgar bones and lyla osborne were the first to arrive they were talking animatedly about how terrible the slytherin keep was avery couldntsave a goal if his life depended on it i actually saw him score against his own team once edgar said amanda and lyla laughed but james was too dejected to enjoy the joke the beaters toby cryer and bill turvish and the keeper joshua kit came in a couple of minutes later the beaters were pretending to duel with their clubs and toby almost smacked bill in the head they all started to get their robes on and when they were finished they sat and waited diligently for james to begin his pre game pep talk alright you lot this is what we have been working for keep your heads in the game and remember what we worked on toby and bill make aim for malfoy amanda edgar and lyla just make clean quick and sharp passes joshua malfoy and his lot love the left side so protect it like your life depends on it i will do my best to make it a short game james said the team gathered their brooms and started to walk out on to the pitch they could hear the roar of applause when the sirius started to say their names james loved the rush of a quidditch game he couldnthelp but smile when he heard sirius announced his presence on the pitch and here come the captain james potter sirius shouted the gryffindors cheered with excitement as the slytherins booed at the sound of his name malfoy and his team were already out on the field and were ready to mount their brooms james heard the whistle blow and his mounted his clean sweep and was soon soaring towards the sky the gryffindors quickly gained possession of the quaffle edgar passed it to his sister who made a brilliant fake out when crabbe tried to knock her off her broom amanda quickly handed the quaffle off to lyla who shot off like a rocket towards the goal and took a clear shot at the goal avery made a dive for the quaffle but he was too slow gryffindor was up by ten james pumped his fist in triumphant and then remembered to start looking for the snitch lestrange was lurking behind him hoping that james would lead him to the golden ball but james made a couple of fake outs and soon lost him james looked up just in time to see edgar take a bludger to the head edgar performed a quick anti pain spell and was back into the action in no time this time he was angry after toby sent the bludger straight towards malfoy who dropped the quaffle edgar made a quick recovery and flew like a madman towards the goal the crowd roared with delight as the score quickly became 20 0 slytherin was quick to respond as malfoy took possession of the quaffle and successfully evaded the blocking attempts by both of the gryffindor beaters and he threw the quaffle through the left hoop for a goal lyla grabbed the quaffle and was off speeding down the pitch she threw the quaffle to amanda who made a brilliant play by diving at the last minute which forced crabbe and goyle to smack into each other amanda scored quickly and james felt himself breath a little easier he looked for lily in the stands and saw her sitting with chloe and the other 7th year girls she looked rather disinterested in the game and when he tried to fly by her and give a wave she pretended not to notice james couldnthelp but feel disappointed that lily wasntimpressed by his moves suddenly he saw the snitch it was hovering right about lestrange head and he was too dense to notice it was there the snitch took off and was plummeting towards the ground james pointed his broom straight towards the ground and was hurdling faster and faster towards the grass below him lestrange was giving chase potter and lestrange seem to be going after the snitch lestrange is such a cheater and only follows james because he is too stupid to find the snitch himself sirius shouted over the crowd mcgonagall gave him a stern look and sirius went back to calling the game fairly potter and lestrange are neck and neck lestrange tries to bump potter of his broom but potter holds on tight faster james faster sirius shouted mr black please call the game correctly or you shall receive detention for a month professor mcgonagall said angrily sirius nodded his head in amusement and tried his hardest not to be biased james suddenly pulled up his broomstick and lestrange went crashing into the ground oh beautiful move james potter has pulled the wronski feint and lestrange is out of the competition of course he learned that from his best friend in the whole world sirius black sirius shouted mr black please mcgonagall shouted james was flying five feet about the ground and he stretched his arm out and made a spectacular grab the crowd shouted with glee as james showed everyone that he had the snitch the gryffindors had beaten the slytherins 200 30 the gryffindor stands emptied and the field was soon flooded with red and gold as everyone came to celebrate the victory sirius sprinted down from the stands and grabbed his best mate and gave him a huge hug everyone congratulated james on a brilliant game and the team was soon surrounded by excited fans lily looked on as she saw james stand in the middle of a crowd of girls emmeline vance advanced on james and threw her arms around him as she gave him a kiss on the cheek james you were terrific i have never seen such magnificent flying emmeline cooed james was speechless but he saw lily expression and wanted to run after her he pushed emmeline off of him and started to sprint in lily direction lily turned towards the castle and tried her best to reach it before james could come running after her she had no desire to talk to him or hear his explanations she was too hurt lily wait james shouted lily didntturn around but he soon caught up to her leave me alone potter i sure you and emmeline will be very happy together lily said angrily she ran towards the castle and james just stood there dumbstruck was it possible that she cared about him as more than a friend sirius remus and peter soon joined him but james felt no cause to celebrate he had hurt lily and he was going to have to fix it author note boys are so oblivious sometimes i hope this chapter reads well i ve had a stressful week so any reviews would make me very happy i trying very hard to get the next chapter done before i leave on vacation so please give me some motivation do i have to wear muggle clothes james asked as he took a swig from his mug he and lily were sitting in the three broomsticks with glasses of butterbeer engrossed in conversation lily received a letter from her mother last week informing her that her awful sister petunia was getting married to vernon dursley a rather grotesque man who gave muggles a bad name he rather reminded lily of an angry hippopotamus both in temperament and physical appearance her mother suggested that lily bring a friend to make the event more bearable she wanted to bring james so her parents could meet him but she was afraid that if he met her sister and vernon he would run for the hills and never come back finally after a week of agonizing she decided to invite him his feelings would be hurt if she didntand it really would be a comfort to have him there for support my sister would have a fit if you show up in wizarding robes lily said as she pictured petunia expression on her face if james walked into her ordinary boring wedding in dress robes part of her wanted to let him do it after all the horrible things her sister had said and done to her over the years dontworry sirius already said you could borrow his muggle tuxedo from halloween last year and you will look very handsome in it she finished james couldnthelp but be excited that lily had invited him to her sister wedding it would be his chance to prove to her how serious he is about their relationship there was only one problem he knew nothing about the muggle world growing up in a prominent wizarding family sheltered him from the non magical world and he was afraid he was going to make fool of himself in front of lily parents lils why haventi ever heard you talk about your sister before james asked suddenly lily looked at him and a sad expression grew over her face she and petunia were very close as little girls she could still remember how petunia used to hold her hand when they walked to school together so she wouldntget lost petunia had been the one who taught her how to tie her shoe laces and to write her name they used to spend hours playing with their dolls in the room they shared that had all changed when lily found out she was a witch her sister felt threatened by lily because she was different and if there was one thing petunia hated it was anything that was out of the ordinary her sister could only point fingers at her and call her a freak she doesntunderstand our world and she doesntwant to she is very close minded and treats me as if i dontexist because i was born different lily said miserably james put his arm around lily and kissed her hair he couldntimagine anyone not loving lily because she was a witch he was attracted to her talent strength and intelligence well if she says anything rude at the wedding i ll hex her dress to turn a disgusting shade of green james said with a chuckle their private moment was interrupted when sirius loudly entered the pub and came over and sat down across the table from them bloody bitch sirius said as he gnashed his teeth angrily he was covered from head to toe in mud and even his black hair was a frightful shade of brown i see you ve had a run in with the mysterious alana james said with a grin she mad all i did was suggest we find a more private place to continue our conversation and she used a blasting curse to send me flying into a mud puddle she wicked with that wand of hers sirius lamented trying to hide his embarrassment from being beaten by a girl twice who is alana lily asked curiously as she pointed her wand at sirius and said scourgify she the perfect woman no one compares to her beauty and brains james said in a voice that imitated sirius lily playfully hit james on the shoulder for making fun of his friend but half out of jealousy sirius gave her an appreciative smile and then promised he would do much worse if james kept up his antics when he suggested limiting james reproductive capabilities lily began to blush furiously what the matter are you upset that some poor girl you are chasing after isntfalling for the infamous black charm james retorted sarcastically james lily said irritably dontworry sirius she will come around the best ones are worth waiting for isntthat right james james wasntpaying attention at this point but instead fiddling with the golden snitch that was sitting in his pocket lily kicked him under the table and he jumped to attention oh right yes you dontwant a girl who is too easy james replied lamely lily only rolled her eyes right well we better be going if we are going to get to detention on time sirius said to james in an attempt to keep him from saying something stupid to lily this was just an excuse that the boys had made up to keep lily and chloe from asking too many questions it was the full moon so they planned on keeping moony company it had been quite some time since the marauders had been on one of their infamous adventures and all of the boys were looking forward to the evening festivities lily was very doubtful of their excuse at first because most teachers didnthand out detentions for the weekend but sirius fabricated a story about mcgonagall offering the marauders the chance to erase a week worth of detention if they gave up a saturday night to do their time lily finally accepted their reason for disappearing and remus was eagerly waiting for them as he prepared for the transformation in the hospital wing blasted mcgonagall james said for the added effect as he kissed lily on the lips and promised to spend the entire day with her tomorrow lily just raised her eye brows skeptically and couldnthelp but feel that james and his friends were up to something dontget in to too much trouble boys lily said knowingly as the boys started to leave sirius and james looked at each other with expressions of guilt on their faces and couldnthelp but marvel at lily ability to know everything how does she do it sirius asked in a whispered tone i dontknow but it bloody scary sometimes james replied later that night lily and chloe sat in the common room and stared at the fire with bored expressions on their faces they had tried everything from playing exploding snap to even studying but being confined to the common room wasntentertaining the younger students had long since gone to bed and the other 7th year girls were busy trying to catch up on their studies lily and chloe were restless and somewhat annoyed that their boyfriends were not telling them the truth there is no way they have detention tonight i saw mcgonagall earlier today and she said she was going to the ministry of magic for urgent business lily said as she played with her hair at least james doesntlie to you about having a sick mother i swear i saw him in the hospital wing when i went to get a potion for my headache this afternoon chloe replied the girls continued to watch the fire roar as they tried to figure out what the marauders were hiding this is total bullocks we shouldntbe sitting around obsessing about our dim witted boyfriends let go have an adventure of our own lily said resolutely as she stood up and racked her brain for ideas chloe looked at her friend with interest she couldnthelp but marvel at the transformation lily had made over the past months the old lily would have admonished any of her friends for coming up with such a reckless idea however james potter and his marauder ways were starting to rub off on the once rule abiding head girl i say we sneak out of the castle just you and me it ll be like it used to be before james and remus managed to trick us into dating them lily said mischievously chloe began to smile she missed her best friend they hardly spent any time together and with the darkness that had fallen over the wizarding world it was important to have friends to support you yeah we can have just as much if not more fun than the marauders chloe replied excitedly i know where james keeps his invisibility cloak lily continued plotting before long they were creeping up the stairs to the 7th year boys dormitory lily tapped her wand against the lock and magically the door swung open the room was dark but lily could still see the clothes that were strewn all over the floor she found a pair of boxers lying besides james bed and she couldnthelp but blush at the thought that they could be his she stooped down and looked for the secret trunk that james stored under his bed it was concealed with an invisibility charm so lily had to grope around to find it finally she hit something hard and she pulled it out and opened the trunk to her surprise the cloak was missing it gone lily said to her dismay those little gits probably took it to accomplish whatever mayhem they are about to unleash on the school dontworry marlene has one and i know she would be more than happy to lend it to us chloe said she had a feeling that if they left the castle and explored the grounds they would find the missing marauders after begging and pleading with marlene to borrow the cloak the girls were on their way to the secret passage that sirius said would lead them out of the castle what if we get caught chloe whispered in a worried tone we will be if you arentquiet lily replied as she continued to lead the way to the hidden passage after what seemed like hours of walking the girls reached their destination lily pressed on the statue the way sirius had shown her and the entrance to the passageway made itself visible it awfully dark down there lil chloe said timidly come on we ve snuck through a lot of secret tunnels this year what makes you think this one will be different lily replied trying to hide the fear in her voice lily grabbed chloe by the hand and pulled her through the entrance lumos the girls said together so their wands could provide light they walked through the tunnel for what seemed like ages with their wands out ready for anything that might happen chloe let out a whimper as she stepped in something wet but was too terrified to look down and see what the substance was look i see light we must be getting close lily said optimistically they stepped out into the moon lit night and breathed a sigh of relief it was a chilly but clear night as the snow sparkled and the moon provided light for the girls to see arm in arm they walked down to the lake what a beautiful night i glad we decided to do this chloe said as she found a spot and lay down in the snow lily quickly followed and as she gazed up at the brilliant moon she felt an instant peace overcome her she wasntworried about the newts or making things work with james or her sister awful wedding i sorry we haventspent much time together lately it has just been so hectic lily said somewhat timidly as she didntwant to provoke an angry response from chloe dontworry lils i happy for you and james and even if i furious with remus i love him we are still best friends no matter what chloe replied as she stared up at the stars you love remus how do you know why didntyou tell me lily asked surprised love was such a big concept to lily and she had no idea how to define it to her it was this goal that all relationships strove to reach yet the trouble was she didntknow if she had reached that mark yet or not she knew she cared about james deeply but did that mean she loved him it caught her off guard that chloe was willing to say those words so casually i suppose i know i love him because it just feels right to be with him he it chloe said seriously have you told him that yet lily asked curiously at this suggestion chloe sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees no and i wonttell him until he trusts me enough to tell me what bothering him chloe said somewhat defiantly lily laughed at her friend stubbornness only because it came right from a page in her own play book but james had changed that part of her nature yes she still hated to be wrong and she was very passionate but being in a relationship with someone just as stubborn as herself made her value the art of compromise maybe if you tell him how you feel he ll be more confident about where he stands with you and he wonthide things from you lily suggested thoughtfully chloe reached over and hugged her friend for the comfort and support she had given her awe isntthat cute someone behind the girls laughed crazily lily and chloe whipped around to see lucius malfoy and rodolphus lestrange standing over them with their wands at the ready lily and chloe quickly got to their feet and had their wands trained on the two slytherins look what we have here rodolphus if it isntthe mudblood head girl and her blood traitor talentless friend too bad potter and lupin arenthere to protect you from us malfoy said as a look of pleasure spread across his handsome yet twisted face dontyou ever tire of losing to me malfoy lily replied sarcastically i think we should teach these two how to respect their superiors lestrange said darkly you arentworth the mud on dumbledore boots and neither is your insane lord voldemort chloe said as she pointed her wand at lestrange chest your heroic dumbledore isnthere to save you from us is he so dontspeak of things you do no know lestrange replied as he used his height to tower over chloe in an attempt to intimidate her malfoy grabbed lily by the shoulder and forced her to the ground lily fell with a hard thud chloe quickly moved in front of her to protect her from any hexes or curses the slytherins might use however lestrange quickly pushed her to the side so malfoy could take aim at lily we have a score to settle malfoy said menacingly is that the way you wish to win malfoy pushing your opponent to the ground isntvery courageous of you if you want to fight face me like a man and not a petulant child lily taunted lily attempted to life herself off the ground but lestrange put his foot on her chest to keep her from moving a simple body binding charm would have done the trick but if you insist on being a brute lily said as she felt all of the air escaping her lungs chloe ran over to her friend but malfoy was quicker and screamed stupefy chloe body froze instantly as she fell to the ground lily tried to raise her wand but lestrange foot was preventing her from lifting her arm expelliarmus malfoy shouted and lily wand flew into his outstretched hand i not scared of you lily shouted as she watched malfoy point his wand at her chest you should be you filthy mudblood i will teach you to fear me there is no one to hear you scream malfoy snarled cr before malfoy could get the words out of his mouth a tall elegant stag came from behind and pushed malfoy to the ground with a thud lily looked at the animal and it hazel eyes stared back at her with feeling it was if the stately creature was telling her to run the stag turned his antlers towards lestrange and pawed the ground as if he were about to charge as lestrange was reaching for his wand to ward off the beast lily used her free hand to apply a strong punch to his groin the boy crippled over in pain and lily swore she could see a smile form on the stag face the stag walked over to lily and put his face down towards her she reached out and stroked the strong animal silvery fur stupefy malfoy yelled as he got back up to his feet and the large stag soon lay unmoving on the ground stupid beast malfoy snarled as he laughed at the stunned stag not so dangerous are you now malfoy kicked the stag in the ribs and lily let out a scream stop she yelled as she ran over to malfoy and tried to physically restrain him with the back of his hand malfoy hit lily squarely in the face but she didntstop she was kicking him and hitting him with all of her might if she didnthave her wand she would cause malfoy pain by her own hands for his part malfoy delighted himself in kicking the unmoving stag as he attempted to fend off the angry blows of lily enough malfoy roared as he delivered a blow to lily stomach she crumpled to the ground and started to wince in pain lestrange who had regained his composure was striding towards lily and malfoy let me at her lestrange screamed as he pointed his wand at lily however the boys turned around as they heard a howl that could only be identified as a werewolf s no sooner had they adjusted their eyes to the unending darkness that lay before them then they came face to face with a fully grown werewolf moony growled ferociously at the two young death eaters with one swift move malfoy and lestrange were on their backs as the large animal loomed over them with pain in his face while in werewolf form moony could barely control himself and for that reason padfoot had been trying to restrain him from running towards the group of students however when moony had heard chloe scream before she was hit with malfoy curse something inside him stirred he quickly thwarted padfoot attempts to hold him back and went charging towards the scene he felt a primal instinct to protect chloe and lily from their attackers he was now face to face with the slytherins and the werewolf part of him wanted to rip them limb from limb but the human inside of him couldn t instead he just stared at the two boys who were shaking with fright at the sight of him he looked around and saw chloe unmoving body and felt something akin to human emotion run through his body grudgingly he let the two terrified slytherins up and chased them back towards the castle he slowly made his way towards chloe body but before he could reach it padfoot caught up with him and was attempting to wrestle him back towards the forbidden forest moony fought bitterly to get to chloe but padfoot wasntabout to let him near her with a pounding head chloe attempted to open her eyes her whole body ached with pain as she willed herself to get up off the ground suddenly she heard snarling and yelping and turned around to see padfoot wrestling moony as moony tossed padfoot away from him and stood up to his full height chloe let out a blood curdling scream get away from me you monster she yelled as she quickly found her wand in her pocket and pointed it at the beast that stood before her prongs who was busy being nursed back to health by lily saw chloe point her wand at moony and quickly charged her but chloe screams of terror were enough to drive moony back towards the woods as padfoot chased after him prongs walked back over to lily and looked at her with his hazel eyes lily stared at him and felt as if she had seen the animal before there was something familiar in the way he looked at her she smiled at the magnificent animal and patted him gratefully on the head the stag nuzzled her with his face then ran off towards the forbidden forest to rejoin his friends lily and chloe looked at each other and started limping towards the castle lily still felt as if she had the wind knocked out of her and hoped that under the bruises malfoy had given her nothing was broken chloe entire body was stiff with pain and they leaned on each other for support as they approached the castle chloe suggested they just go to bed but lily saw the gash on chloe forehead where she had collided with a rock when malfoy had struck her and decided that they both needed to visit madame pomfrey in the hospital wing back again are you been causing trouble i suspect that what you get hanging around with potter and his lot madame pomfrey fussed as the two girls dragged themselves into the hospital wing after tending to lily broken rib and sprained ankle and fixing chloe head wound madame pomfrey sent the girls promptly to bed lily head hit the pillow and she fell instantly into a deep dreamless sleep and only woke up when she could feel the sun on her face a warm kiss grazed her forehead and when she finally decided to wake up she met the same hazel eyes she had seen the night before how are you feeling james asked with great concern in his voice as soon as remus transformed back into himself james had run up to the hospital wing and with much persuasion and a great deal of charm he convinced madame pomfrey to let him sit by lily bed when he saw her bruises and cuts he felt the urge to find malfoy and pummel him he remembered hearing lily cries while he and the other marauders were exploring the forest and he could still see malfoy throwing lily to the ground and raising his wand at her however when lily opened her eyes and looked at him his anger dissolved and he just felt relieved that she was ok my ribs are still a little sore but i a lot better now that you are here lily said with a smile as she kissed james on the lips he pulled her into an embrace but she started to wince in pain and he quickly let go i sorry i wasntthere last night lils dumbledore explained everything and malfoy and lestrange received detention but somehow that doesntseem like enough james said with a frown on his face for her part lily couldntstop staring at james eyes they reminded her so much of the stag eyes she had seen the night before something strange happened last night right when malfoy was about to attack me a stag suddenly appeared and saved me the animal looked at me and i could have sworn it was trying to tell me something it had the most familiar eyes lily said as she continued to look at james however before james could answer chloe ran past them with tears in her eyes chloe lily shouted but chloe ignored her friend calls and left the hospital wing as fast as she could chloe ran as fast as her feet could carrier until she couldntrun anymore and when stopped she found herself in the astronomy tower she collapsed on the floor and let her tears flow freely as she tried to make sense of what had just happened when she woke up remus was in the bed next to her and he was covered with cuts and scratches she got out of bed and went over to see him remus what happened she asked as she tried to kiss him but he pulled away i will kill those stupid friends of yours for getting you hurt like this remus couldntbring himself to look at chloe he could only remember the fear in her eyes when she had seen him as a werewolf when she found out the truth that look would come back and she would want nothing to do with him remus look at me chloe insisted when he finally looked at chloe he saw the cut on her head and the bruises on her body a fear that he had caused any of those injuries overcame him and he was incredibly angry at himself for trying to help her he couldntcontrol himself as a werewolf and he was dangerous to anyone around him tell me what is going on chloe demanded as she examined remus cuts and bruises you should stay away from me remus said quietly i ll only hurt you i dontwant to stay away from you just tell me what is going on i can help chloe pleaded as tears began to sting her eyes please just go away remus replied with pain in his voice chloe tried to put her arms around remus but he quickly put them at her side i love you chloe said as tears rolled down her cheeks remus looked at the sobbing girl in front of him and couldnthelp but notice that even she was crying chloe was beautiful he wanted to pull her into his arms and kiss her but he didnttrust himself how can you love a monster like me remus said softly chloe eyes began to widen what do you mean chloe asked as she choked back her tears i a werewolf everything else was a blur all chloe could remember was remus stoic yet pained expression on his face as she tried to search his eyes for feeling yet all she found were the walls he had built to protect himself she couldntget the words it over chloe out of her head she felt as if she were going crazy each time she replayed the scene her heart would break again until she finally collapsed onto the floor of the astronomy tower in a heap and let the sobs wrack her small body he didnteven give her a chance to respond she thought desperately he cared nothing for her she loved him with her heart and soul and he wouldnteven give her the chance to show him how she felt she wanted desperately to have remus hold her but she knew he wouldn t he was too proud while she was in anguish over losing the person she loved she was also angry at remus for keeping such a large secret from her did he think she wouldntstill care about him did he think she was that cruel and closed minded she curled up in a corner and closed her eyes wishing that none of it had happened and everything was just a dream tomorrow she would wake up and remus would hug and kiss her and tell her how much he loved her yet no matter how hard she tried she couldntconvince herself that this was the truth in her heart she knew it was really over soon exhaustion took over as she had not slept since being attacked the night before and she fell asleep with tears still in her eyes she woke up when the sun shinning through the window hit her face and she felt the warmth heat her cold and clammy skin her eyes fluttered open and when they did she came face to face with bellatrix black what do you want chloe said wearily she was in no mood to trifle with someone like bellatrix now is that anyway to talk to someone who wants to help you bellatrix said as she wagged a finger of disapproval how could you possibly help me and why would you want to chloe replied with some irritation at bellatrix imposition on her solitude let just say our interests are temporarily aligned you want to forget remus lupin and i can help you do that bellatrix said as a smile crossed her twisted face to bellatrix chloe was the perfect opportunity to gain information about potter his mudblood girlfriend black lupin and pettigrew her master watched them closely because he knew they were powerful and sympathetic to dumbledore bellatrix knew she would be rewarded for providing lord voldemort with important information about how to keep the group from interfering with his plans what makes you think you know what i want chloe said somewhat dejectedly she had no energy to fight bellatrix she simply wanted to feel nothing but the numbness that was building up inside of her she had no strength left so despite her better judgment she continued to listen to bellatrix offer i know all about you and your break up with lupin he cares nothing for you he thinks you are weak and therefore not worthy of his trust or love your so called friends want nothing to do with you last night i heard them laughing about how pathetic you are even your best friend the mudblood doesntcare about you she is so wrapped up in her boyfriend that she hasnteven noticed that you didntsleep in your bed last night i can change that i can offer you the power to make people notice you you will open their eyes so they can see that you are not a person to be ignored bellatrix said with a grin on her face what bellatrix had said struck a nerve with chloe she was tired of being ignored of not cared about she would no longer let her friends shelf her and only pay her attention when it was convenient for them bellatrix smile widened as she saw the expression on chloe face harden she knew the stupid girl would cooperate she would get the information she desired i know how powerful you are i ve seen what you are capable of and i can help you reach your potential bellatrix continued come on pet let bella make it all better bellatrix extended her hand to chloe and chloe looking for a way out of it all the easy way took it that right pet follow me bellatrix said as she led chloe out of the tower chloe followed hesitantly as her broken heart interfered with her head and kept her from thinking clearly after being released from the hospital wing remus walked dejectedly back to gryffindor tower he limbs felt like led as he urged his body to move forward he knew he had done the right thing by breaking up with chloe but then why did it hurt so much he only wanted to protect her from the heartache and the pain that would come from caring about someone like himself remus journey through life would be one that needed to be walked alone he could barely take care of himself let alone a girlfriend or possibly some day a wife what kind of life could he give chloe it would be nearly impossible to find work after leaving hogwarts and there would be the discrimination to face he wouldntbe able to take the pity that chloe would give him every time he fell upon hardship too much about his future was unknown and it just wouldntbe responsible to make chloe bear his burden with him he reluctantly opened the door to his bedroom and flopped down on his bed he found a pillow and quickly punched it out of frustration and said a few choice curse words to vent his anger he didntrealize that he was not alone blimey mate that pillow is getting a harder beating than a bludger during a quidditch match what eating you sirius said as he emerged from the bathroom remus groaned and wished that for once in his life he could have some privacy he was in no mood to deal with sirius antics he just wanted to be left alone to wallow in his misery bugger off was all remus could say sirius looked at the pitiful expression on remus face and knew that he needed a friend come on mate you can tell ol padfoot sirius said as he sat down next to remus and put an arm around his shoulders remus knew sirius too well so that meant sirius would not leave him alone until he told him what was bothering him he slumped his shoulders and reluctantly told sirius the whole story he started off by describing how chloe had been pestering him for the last week and then how she had seen him as a werewolf finally he ended with the scene in the hospital wing i broke it off remus said with a great deal of sorrow in his voice you fucking idiot sirius said without any remorse thanks a lot mate remus said as he got up from his bed and started to walk to the bathroom at least that door had a lock he thought to himself the last thing he needed was to have one of his best mates criticize him he needed sirius support at the moment not disapproval sirius realized that perhaps he had been a bit too harsh so he attempted to rephrase his thoughts in a more tactful manner i sorry i didntmean to be such a prat it just that you are being completely daft the girl loves you mate sirius tried again this time with a little bit more sensitivity at this remus wheeled around and looked as if he was about to punch sirius in the mouth please sirius god of relationships and love give me all of your wisdom about women because all of your vast experience certainly makes you an expert remus said venomously sirius was taken aback by his normally passive friend hostile behavior he decided to try to get through to remus one last time please remus as your best mate just listen to me look how unhappy you are without her this is madness there is no reason you shouldntrun and apologize for hurting her sirius said before putting his hands in front of his face in case remus decided to take a swing at him but remus just stood frozen as he tried to absorb sirius words sirius was wrong he thought to himself he didntknow the situation or know what it was like to live a life as an outcast it was impossible for him to understand you just dontget it do you remus finally said as he slumped his shoulders in a gesture of retreat i a monster sirius immediately went over to remus and embraced him in a brotherly hug at first remus didntrespond but the overwhelming range of emotions he felt at the moment forced him to let down the walls that he used to conceal his inner turmoil and he hugged sirius back you arenta monster and chloe knows that you didnteven give her a chance to accept you sirius said as he pulled away she at least deserves that remus didntknow if he had the strength to withstand a rejection from chloe if he gave her the chance to express her feelings about his situation he loved her too much and his heart wouldntbe able to take it what if she doesntwant anything to do with me remus said hoarsely dontworry mate sirius said with a grin she loves you suddenly remus began to feel as if he had made a huge mistake he loved chloe and perhaps that was all that mattered he felt an urge to go find her and try to rectify his mistake thanks mate remus said but unlike when he had said it before he actually meant it i have to go see about a girl with that remus walked out of the room in search of chloe in hopes that she would forgive him for being a daft idiot sirius couldnthelp but congratulate himself for potentially saving his friend from making a terrible mistake now he wanted to go see if he could find alana and bug her somehow getting hexed by her wasntthat terrible meanwhile james and lily were outside on the grounds arguing james henry potter show me or i will never kiss you again lily said adamantly this was a threat that james took very seriously but he couldnthelp but smile at his beautiful girlfriend well if you put it like that i guess i have no choice james said rather cheekily suddenly lily came face to face with prongs she was staring at the same hazel eyes she had seen the night before and realized why they were so familiar they belonged to james she couldnthelp but laugh at the white fur around the stag eyes that made the shape of a pair of glasses she cautiously pet the magnificent animal and prongs moved closer to her to show signs of affection at first she had been furious when james had told her that he was an unregistered animagus she made a point of telling him how dangerous it was and how he could be thrown in azkaban for such a reckless act you could receive a life sentence in azkaban james lily had said with great concern what hurt her more was the fact that james had hid it from her he tried to explain that it was not her secret to tell rather remus but she didntwant any secrets between them however she soon realized that what james sirius and peter were doing was one of the kindest things she had ever heard of instead of abandoning remus like so many others had done they selflessly and at great risk to themselves helped to make the painful transitions easier for their friend it was at this point she realized that james potter recklessness was really starting to rub off on her it a really painful process lil and we dontwant him to do it alone can you imagine how lonely that would be james said trying to convince her that his law breaking was for a good cause lily was mesmerized by the beautiful creature that stood before her she had so many questions she wanted to know what it felt like to transform how had james chosen to become a stag and what it felt like to be an animal she wanted to know everything this was so exciting to her prongs transformed back into james and he looked at lily with anticipation for her reaction lily walked up to him and pulled his face to her so she could kiss him when they pulled apart she stared into his eyes and felt complete i love you lily said before she realized what she was saying james stood there in shock those were the words he had been waiting to hear but he didntknow what to do in his wildest dreams he never thought lily evans could ever love him lily turned bright red when james didntrespond and desperately tried to back pedal well what i mean is um but james lips on hers made it hard for her to complete her sentence i love you too james said rather flushed as he held lily to him well then why didntyou say something earlier you let me stand there like a big idiot lily said somewhat irritably but in reality she was elated and somewhat relieved that he returned her feelings i was just shocked that all i always thought i d be the first one to say it james said somewhat conceitedly lily words had definitely gone to his head that so typically male always trying to control the situation lily argued are you calling me dominating james replied with a chuckle i am just saying that you always want everything to happen on your terms and it is a bit annoying lily replied as her eyes started to build a fire in them james just stared at her and laughed she really knew how to ruin a moment you are the most stubborn person in the world lily evans and god help me for loving you james said with a smirk oh god you are right here we are professing our love for each other and we cantdo it without arguing how is this every going to work lily said somewhat abashedly but as she said this she kissed james on the lips well arguing is just what we do you tell me when i am being arrogant and i tell you when you are being a pain in the ass james said with a smile it doesntmean we dontlove each other lily decided to accept this answer for the time being and gave in and kissed james with all of the passion she had remus spent the entire afternoon scouring the castle looking for chloe so far he had checked the astronomy tower the herbology greenhouse the room of requirement the kitchen and everywhere else he could think of he was now searching the marauder map desperately in hopes that she would turn up but for some reason she was no where to be found he silently cursed himself for being so stupid what if something had happened to chloe he was starting to panic when the saw the initials c s appear in the great hall without wasting any time remus sprinted out of the gryffindor common room and raced to chloe as fast as he could when he saw her his heart nearly stopped somehow she looked different her normally cheerful face had nothing but a blank expression on it she looked gaunt and hollow and remus stomach pitched at the idea that he could have possibly caused this drastic change in her emotional appearance he wanted nothing more than to pull her to him and tell her how stupid he was for pretending not to love her back this drove him to approach chloe and as he did she turned around and looked at him as if he didntexist hello chloe he said quietly mr lupin chloe replied void of any emotion look i think we need to talk remus said taken aback by chloe lack of acknowledgement of his presence chloe continued to stare at the wall that rose behind remus i not at your beckon call anymore chloe said coolly chloe lack of emotion began to scare remus and he started to wonder if perhaps an apology wasntgoing to work determined to not give up remus pressed on i was an idiot last night remus tried but chloe put up a hand to silence him what done is done now please just leave me alone chloe said and as she finished bellatrix and narcissa joined her and glared at remus you heard her lupin now run along and dontbother her again bellatrix said menacingly excuse me but this is between me and chloe it doesntinvolve you remus said angrily she not interested now move on lupin or we will force you to narcissa said as she stepped in front of chloe chloe eagerly accepted bellatrix and narcissa protection and retreated from the confrontation with remus as she left the dinning hall remus tried to run after her but several bullying slytherins prevented him from doing so chloe remus yelled as he was being engulfed by slytherins but she didntrespond james and sirius entered the great hall just in time to see remus attacked by the menacing slytherins and they quickly ran over to join in the fight after each slytherin had been tossed off remus sirius extended a hand to his friend what was that all about james asked heatedly it over was all remus could manage to say she wants nothing to do with me author note ok i know that it been almost a month and a half since i last update but i have been extremely busy i ve been in london for about 20 days now and i have to say that it is the most beautiful city in the world i just love everything about it i have been really busy exploring so i think i do have a pretty good excuse oh and my flat just got internet so before then i couldnthave posted anyway but here is the long awaited chapter i not sure it is any good because i have had serious writer block nothing i wrote sounded right to me so please review and i ll try and be faster with my posts but for the next three months or so i ll be pretty busy cheers hey wait up sirius shouted as he sprinted down the corridors when he reached alana he slipped his arm around her shoulder and gave her his most dashing smile if i didntknow any better i d think you were trying to ignore me sirius said as he strode along side the irritated girl you arentwrong black and please remove your arm before i perform a severing charm on it alana replied sirius had grown to enjoy alana hostile attitude towards him since their meeting in the tower he had made it his own personal crusade to find out more about the enchanting dark haired beauty so far he had come up with nothing no one seemed to know her and for a while sirius wondered if he was seeing a ghost he had talked to almost all of his acquaintances in hufflepuff and ravenclaw and none knew of her he refused to believe she was a slytherin because he couldntsee that inherent pension for evil that existed in every slytherin eye she was still just as much of a mystery to him as she had been on their first meeting that was what intrigued him plus he hated being ignored by beautiful girls obviously you dontknow what an honor it is to have me escort you to class sirius said with a laugh most girls would kill to be in your shoes alana couldnthelp but admit to herself that sirius although extremely pompous and egotistical was very charming it took a lot of will power to ignore the words that rolled off of his silver tongue well i not like most girls black and i happen to like my personal space now get off of me alana said as she thrust sirius arm off of her shoulder she quickly turned to her friend and tried to start their conversation back up again but sirius persisted is it possible that my touch makes you nervous alana sirius tried again no actually your touch makes my skin crawl now move on alana demanded somewhat heatedly alright but you ll miss me when i gone sirius said at this alana couldnthelp but smile however she tried to mask it with an expression of contempt as much as she hated to admit it she found herself actually anticipating her daily interactions with sirius black with some degree of excitement she had never met someone who challenged her the way he did plus he was a good target to practice her hexes your allotted time for annoying me is over goodbye sirius alana said to force sirius to take the hint sirius ran off down the corridor but without hesitation turned back and with a great big smile and yelled i know you are thinking about me naked alana alana turned bright red as all of the students in the hallway turned around to look at her she buried her face in her books and to escape the smirks and laughter at her expense her friend turned to her with a dark look on her face you better hope nobody sees you interacting with that prat her friend warned at this alana became a bit incensed she was becoming very tired of having her every move watched and worrying that her behavior was going to upset somebody in her house she wanted very much to do as she pleased and couldntcare less about what people thought of her although she didntcare about sirius it was very annoying to have someone tell her she couldnttalk to him since when have i cared about what people think about me alana replied in a somewhat contrarian tone i just warning you that if word gets out that you are fraternizing with sirius black there are those who would not permit it her friend said somewhat cryptically lily sat on her bed wringing her hands out of nervousness and worry this has gone on for long enough lily told herself chloe hadnttalked to anyone in gryffindor tower for a whole week and now lily was starting to get worried she would leave the room in the middle of the night and lily would not see her again until classes the next morning where chloe looked as if she were a zombie her eyes were blood shot and her face was gaunt at first lily thought chloe just needed some space after her painful break up with remus but now she thought something was wrong she felt it in her gut that chloe was not herself she could be seen walking down the hallways of hogwarts with bellatrix and narcissa black and even on occasion talking to lucius malfoy the very same person who had attacked her not more than a week ago lily looked up and saw chloe walk through the door with a blank expression on her face she summoned her strength and approached chloe with determination we need to talk lily said i busy leave me alone chloe said blandly as if she werentanswering for herself lily was a tad taken aback by her friend total dismissal of her chloe didntseem to be upset or sad but rather just unfeeling and joyless lily hoped that if she tried hard enough she could make chloe feel an emotion even it was anger no lily said adamantly tell me what is going on or i will seal the door and put you in a full body bind and not let you free until you do chloe looked at lily daring her to make good on her threat when lily didntmove chloe attempted to push past her but lily grabbed her arm and prevented her from passing by let go or i will force you to chloe said warningly this isntyou what happened to you chloe are you in trouble you can tell me i your best friend i want to help lily replied as tears started to sting her eyes why dontyou bugger off and shag potter and ignore me like you always did before mudblood chloe said viciously at this lily pulled back and let the tears in her eyes fall down her face willingly she never thought she would hear her own best friend say something so ugly to her if she werentso devastated she would have cursed chloe for her hateful words how could you chloe lily whispered as the tears ran poured out chloe just stood there unaffected by lily sobs she couldntfeel anything it was as if she was a prisoner in her own body she could feel herself screaming to have her feelings released but her brain wouldntlet her console lily she heard a voice in her head telling her not to move just stay out of it lily was all chloe managed to say as she turned around and left the room through her tears lily realized she wasntlooking at her best friend but rather a shell of chloe with something completely different underneath the words that came out of chloe mouth werenthers her voice even sounded different she knew chloe needed her help and she desperately wanted to save her best friend from what was haunting her lily became determined to get her best friend back she needed to find remus because he was the only one who could help her she walked downstairs and found him sitting on the couch with james playing a game of chess she plopped down next to james and stared miserably at the board so the talk with chloe went that well james asked as his tear stained girlfriend looked up at him lily put her head on james shoulder and let all of the energy she had mustered to talk to chloe drain out of her i love you james murmured as he placed a kiss on lily forehead i love you too lily replied as she snuggled into james chest and let herself feel at ease again remus watched this and couldnthelp but feel a twinge of remorse that any chance he had at having someone who loved him had been thrown out the window with chloe his eyes showed the pain and james looked at him and quickly sat up as he didntwant to upset his friend sorry mate james said quietly it doesntmatter now remus said darkly so what happened with her remus asked lily trying to change the subject she called me a lily paused because she couldntget the words out mudblood she what james said somewhat angrily james immediately and remus looked at each other and rage could be seen in both their eyes remus knew what it was like to be discriminated against and he couldntstand the idea that the same thing happened to lily she didntdeserve to have a bad word said against her james just sat their speechless as he tightened his grip around his girlfriend shoulder he scratched his head as if he was trying to figure something out for some reason he couldntimagine sweet and kind chloe saying such a horrible thing something just didntadd up i cantbelieve she would say something like that to you remus said somewhat disgusted at chloe actions she deserves to be pissed at me but you haventdone anything to her but that just it isntit she isntherself she even sounds different but before lily could complete her sentence james interrupted her something has happened to her she needs our help james said as he finally worked out the idea that had been building up in his head remus stared blankly at the couple as they looked at each other as if they were reading each other minds exactly lily said as she kissed james for understanding her you two are mental she is just angry at me for breaking things off and associates you with the marauders since you are dating james remus said trying to rationalize chloe behavior however part of him wanted to believe that something had happened to her and perhaps she still did love him no i know her and she would never say the word mudblood when she said it it was as if someone else was speaking through her we need to find out what happened lily pleaded as she looked into remus skeptical eyes you dontneed my help for this misguided rescues mission because she wants absolutely nothing to do with me so do whatever you please remus said nonplused as he stared at the chess board pondering his next move dontyou see you are probably the only person who can save her she will listen to you because she loves you she told me herself that you are the one for her lily said but as she realized the words that had had come tumbling out of her mouth she stopped herself remus looked at her and the pain built back up in his eyes she said that remus asked hoarsely she told me that there was no one else out there for her but you lily replied quietly remus let these words sink in he knew that chloe had said she loved him but for some reason it hadntregistered in his brain until now she really did care about him and he shouldnthave doubted that now she was walking around like the living dead and it was his fault but he had tried to apologize and it was no use it wasntworth getting his hopes up again he couldnttake the heartache well she has a funny way of showing it she wontlook at me let alone talk to me i ve tried to apologize and tell her what an idiot i was but she wonthave any of it remus replied coldly lily stared at remus as if she was trying to will him to consider her point remus realized that there no way he could convince her that he was right that chloe had changed lily wasntgoing to give up on her friend well if you love her you wontgive up lily said resolutely as she got up and left the common room without looking back james got up to follow her but turned around to make sure remus was ok when she puts her mind to something there is no stopping her remus said as he shook his head yeah i know but she is right on this one mate something odd is definitely going on chloe is not a hateful person james said as he continued to leave the room now i going to go make sure she doesntdo something stupid and piss off a lot of slytherins or at least get in on the action if i can he walked through the portrait hole and found lily waiting for him she looked at him with a devilish expression on her face james leaned into her and pressed her up against the wall as he covered her lips with his he ran his hands over her curves and then placed them on the small of her back as he pulled her closer lily matched his passion as she returned his kisses she slipped her tongue in his warm mouth and let out a grown of contentment as felt her body shiver with excitement when they could no longer breathe they reluctantly pulled away from each other and stared at one another how had he managed to know exactly what she was thinking lily asked herself as she stared into his mysterious hazel eyes we are going to need your invisibility cloak and the marauder map lily said as she finally came back to her senses james smiled at her and placed a gentle and endearing kiss on her forehead you are the most beautiful when you are being mischievous james said with a grin i love you that evening after dinner james and lily lay on lily bed examining the marauder map they were looking for chloe initials to appear so they could track her when they saw her pop up the glanced at each other and smiled this map is pure genius lily said as she got up and prepared herself to go well i am quite brilliant when i want to be but i canttake all of the credit remus and sirius did help a little bit james said with a grin as he grabbed his girlfriend from behind and kisses her neck lily giggled and pushed him away glad to know your ego is still intact potter she said sarcastically as she grabbed the cloak and began to leave the room they walked downstairs to the common room and were relieved to see that it was relatively empty save a few first and second years which meant they wouldnthave to answer their friends questions they slipped through the portrait hole and began walking down the corridors studying the map as they went to find their destination it cold lily complained as they began to descend into the dungeons i know what will warm you up james said with a grin as he slipped his arm around lily and rubbed her shoulders this is no time for flirting james chloe could be in trouble lily said sternly they walked in silence until they reached a portrait and then the waiting began they slipped the invisibility cloak over themselves and sat in silence until someone came to let them into the room being this close to you in a dark hallway makes me want to do dirty things with you james whispered as he placed his hands on lily body lily couldnthelp but giggle but tried to stop herself because they had to be absolutely quiet in case someone came by james please you arentmaking this easy lily whispered as james kissed her neck and face come on evans no one can see us let have a little fun james whispered in a husky voice despite her best efforts lily couldntresist james touch and she soon turned around to face him and took his face in her hands and kissed him she ran her hands through his black messy hair and felt the muscles in his arms from the years of quidditch training she daringly reached under his shirt to feel his chest as she continued to kiss him james returned her touch as he caressed every inch of her body as he accepted her warm salty kisses the continued the snogging session for quite awhile as it was the best way to pass time however they abruptly pulled away from each other when they heard foot steps around the corner the got up in anticipation of sneaking in through the portrait hole and when the slytherin first year said the password the quickly followed him and entered the slytherin common room without detection lily and james stood silently in a corner and studied the map according to it chloe should have been by the fireplace and when the looked up they saw her sitting there with bellatrix black and rodulphus lestrange go to your room its time for the grown ups to play bellatrix said to the little first year that had let lily and james in the scared looking boy scampered up the stairs and reached the confines of his dormitory without looking back the common room was empty now except for chloe and her companions however soon they were joined by lucius malfoy narcissa black severus snape nott avery crabbe goyle and another dark haired girl who neither james nor lily recognized they circled around chloe as she diligently sat in one of the large green arm chairs excellent everyone of importance is here so i believe it is time that we found out what she knows bellatrix said with a laugh the dark lord will be very pleased if we find out any information about dumbledore pets lucius sniggered have you been using your legilmens to control her so that we can see what she sees at this bellatrix let out a sharp laugh that let everyone know just how powerful she was of course lucius she is weak minded and very easily controlled everywhere she goes i go bellatrix replied as her eyes lit up with pleasure excellent everyone replied as they moved in closer to chloe lily and james watched this scene with horror lily felt her stomach drop knowing that chloe had been controlled by bellatrix she began to feel sick to her stomach were they using chloe to get information about herself and her friends lily feared when bellatrix raised her wand to chloe lily wanted to run and stop her from whatever pain she was about to inflict but james grabbed her shoulder to hold her back severus snape obediently played along with bellatrix games but knew that this latest escapade would not further the dark lord cause her true motive was just to infuriate potter and his friends she knew that they would not let her inflict harm on one of their own and when they came she would be ready for them severus watched the scene with mild interest but in reality he wanted to return to his books he looked at the girl standing next to him and could tell she was thinking the same thing imperio bellatrix shouted and as soon as she did chloe body stopped moving and her eyes glazed over tell me about lily evans bellatrix commanded she is very skilled in charms and quite powerful her alliance with james potter could prove to be quite strong chloe replied automatically bellatrix looked mildly satisfied with this answer but wanted more how powerful is james potter bellatrix asked with a tinge of malevolence in her voice he is strong he comes from an extremely long line of powerful wizards he is the but before chloe could finish her sentence bellatrix had interrupted her spell and let out a scream of furry lily had shot a hex at her that had forced her to cry out in pain they are here find them bellatrix cried with anger as her companions split up and began searching the room lily and james stayed perfectly still as they came face to face with lucius malfoy lily felt her heart beating furiously and could feel james beating just as fast as they clung to each other he looked directly at them but saw nothing however instinct told him to reach out and when he did he grabbed the material of the invisibility cloak he quickly ripped it off the couple and shouted with glee i ve found them lucius cried as the others came over to investigate lily and james came face to face with ten potential death eaters however instead of cowering with fright they stood tall with their wands at the ready so you thought you could interrupt our gathering and save your friend bellatrix said with a laugh as she stepped closer to them leave her alone bellatrix lily replied fiercely or what you will hit me with one of your pathetic hexes your magic is no match for the curses that i know bellatrix replied as she stared at lily i think we should make them suffer the consequences for breaking and entering it is not nice to spy lucius said as she stared at james let make potter watch as we have a little fun with his mudblood girlfriend everyone nodded their heads in agreement as james tightened his grip on lily shoulder when grabbe and goyle made an attempt to grab lily james stepped in front of her and pointed his wand at bellatrix chest take your hands off of her or i will force you too james said with anger in his voice at this point james and the slytherins were too busy starring daggers at each other to notice that the black haired girl who had stood next to severus earlier had escaped the common room silently james stood his ground as he used his height to tower over his opponents he wasntgoing to let anyone lay a hand on lily his lily even though they were outnumbered he was going to fight them if he had to lily stood there speechless but with her wand at the ready to fight very noble of you potter but i afraid there is little you can do at this point lucius said with relish impedimenta but james was ready for this as he shouted protego a perfectly summoned shield charm appeared and protected james and lily from the slytherins however it only lasted for a minute very well if you are going to be difficult i will leave you conscious while we have some fun with evans here lucius said and as he drew james attention rodulphus lestrange shouted incarcerous ropes appeared out of thin air and wrapped themselves around james body as he struggled against the full body bind and swore loudly at his stupidity as james lay on the floor unable to move nott and avery reached for lily stupefy lily shouted as she pointed her wand at nott her aim was impeccable and nott collapsed on the floor unconscious however bellatrix quickly disarmed her as she yelled expelliarmus now perhaps that will calm you down bellatrix said as she held lily wand in her long fingers avery grabbed lily and moved her to the center of the room where bellatrix quickly conjured magical ropes that bound her to the chair lily looked around and saw james struggling against his ropes on the floor next to her and to her other side sat chloe chloe eyes were still glazed over but lily thought that perhaps if she screamed it would snap chloe out of it and she would come to their aid chloe help us lily shouted but her words fell on deaf ears she wontlisten to you mudblood she only listens to me bellatrix said as she pointed her wand at chloe and commanded her to get up chloe obediently stood up and came to bellatrix side i think we shall see how strong you are bellatrix said sadistically all of the slytherins crowded around lily as they began to laugh and taunt her not so tough are you now mudblood narcissa sneered lets see if she knows how to play lucius stepped in front of his peers and quickly silenced them these two meddlesome fools have gotten in our way for two long lucius said to his fellow slytherins i think we shall have one of their own teach this mudblood a lesson so they learn not to interfere in our plans lily eyes widened as she realized what lucius was talking about she tried to scream but bellatrix silenced her instead she looked to james and the two looked at each other as lily mouthed the words i love you james kicked and struggled fiercely but a revived nott gave him a swift kick in the head and james could no longer move lily stared at her attackers and didntflinch she would not be scared into submission chloe show us how powerful you are and attack the mudblood bellatrix commanded at these words chloe raised her wand to lily chest chloe saw her best friend sitting in front of her and knew that she couldntattack her but she couldntstop herself internally she kicked and screamed to be let out but the imperious curse was too strong lily saw the remorse in her eyes as chloe began to say the incantation cru stop a voice shouted as a figure bulled into chloe and knocked her backwards off of her feet author note well since my boyfriend is across an ocean and on the other side of a continent from me i had plenty of time on valentine day to finish this chapter i hope everyone enjoys it and has a wonderful day i know chloe isntlooking too good right now and some of you probably hate her and never want her and remus to get back together but she might redeem herself anyways i will try and update again soon but i will be doing a lot of travelling in the next few months and i have a lot of homework as well plus london is just so much fun please read and review as usual because they really make my day and since i am sick from all of the yucky weather here in england i could use some cheering sirius and peter were engrossed in a game of wizard chess while remus sat by the fireplace and read his defense against the dark arts book he was trying to occupy his mind as to block out all thoughts of chloe yet this was proving to be exceptionally difficult everywhere he went he could smell her sweet scent really wormtail i dontknow why i bother playing with you it would be more of a challenge to play a rock sirius said as he moved his piece into position a loud smash echoed throughout the common room as peter knight was quickly destroyed och do you have to be so brutal when you break my pieces peter lamented as he pondered his next move dontbe such a soar loser wormy sirius chuckled however their argument was quickly brought to a halt when the portrait hole swung open and a girl with long dark hair ran through it she had a very worried expression on her face and she was out of breath from running where is sirius black the girl said as she grabbed a first year by the collar sirius saw the girl and a smile crossed his face he strode over to her and grinned picturing me naked got you that flushed alana sirius said charmingly now what the rush we have all night my little spit fire shut up sirius and listen alana said as she tried to catch her breath she was in no mood to put up with his flirtations there wasntenough time she had a dark look on her face and sirius immediately sobered and looked at her with concern it your friends alana said in between deep breaths sirius eyes grew wider as remus came up behind him and listened intently they have lily james and chloe alana continued as her breathing you have to follow me there isntmuch time sirius clenched his fists and grabbed remus for support his mind raced as the endless possibilities of what could be happening to his best friends plagued him remus just stood their sick with worry for chloe no matter how hard he tried he couldntdeny that he loved her and he wouldntbe able to bear it if anything happened to her as if they were both thinking the same thing they grabbed their wands and headed for the portrait hole let go sirius and remus said together as they signaled for alana to lead the way as they started to leave they found themselves joined by peter alice and marlene the group just nodded to each other as they left the room and followed alana they ran as fast as they could not wanting to think about what could happen if they were too late my bloody cousin better not be a part of this or i will make sure my mother favorite niece doesntmake it to any more family gatherings sirius growled as he ran down the corridors they reached the dungeons and alana shouted a password and a portrait swung open sirius remus peter alice and marlene ran into the room and their eyes widened at the scene they saw chloe was raising her wand to lily chest and immediately they sprang into action as there wasnttime to waste stop remus shouted as he tackled chloe and knocked her backwards off of her feet hexes and curses started to shoot across the room as the gryffindors furiously battled the slytherins sirius was actively battling his menacing cousin as marlene was trying to hold lucius at bay one should never raise his wand to family sirius bellatrix taunted as she shot a spell from her wand at her cousin well it a good thing mother disowned me then because i ve been wanting to give you a proper beating for some time now sirius said as he deflected the spell and shot another one in return on the other side of the room marlene mckinnon was enjoying some target practice on lucius malfoy as she tested her reflexes marlene was an extremely talented witch and she was easily holding malfoy at bay you can do better than that you giant wanker marlene shouted as she quickly deflected a spell lucius had sent her way that for being stupid and getting me a poor grade on the transfiguration assignment while remus created a diversion by lifting crabbe goyle and avery into the air and spinning them about alice quickly untied both james and lily and handed them their wands so they could join the battle they didnthesitate as james went off to pay nott back for the kick to the head face me like a man you stupid bastard james shouted as he shot a jet of green light at nott chest lily found herself dueling narcissa black and was winning quite easily she quickly pacified the blonde with the ropes that shot from her wand and moved on to find another one of her attackers she wanted to do worse to her attacker but decided that her mercy was what separated her from them she turned around and came face to face with bellatrix excellent i ve been waiting for you let dance mudblood bellatrix said as she shot a spell in lily direction lily easily deflected it as she countered with a hex that left bellatrix screaming in pain impedimenta bellatrix shouted and lily felt herself flying backwards as she smashed into the stone wall behind her she fell to the ground with a sickening thud however she was not about to let bellatrix get the better of her she was the hogwarts dueling champion and refused to lose petrificus totalus lily shouted but bellatrix quickly moved out of the way and laughed come on mudblood put up a fight bellatrix cackled as she conjured her next curse lily didntknow what hit her but she her head began to feel as if it was about to explode she began to feel her skin burn and she let out a scream of pain however she willed herself to go on she wouldntlet bellatrix beat her she pulled herself up off the ground as bellatrix approached her apparently ready to keep her from rising again stupefy lily bellowed and this time her aim was impeccable bellatrix fell to the ground with a look of pure shock on her face lily quickly bound her with magical ropes and went to make sure that everyone else was holding up she focused her eyes just in time to see chloe get hit with a stunning spell by avery there that ll keep her from running away avery said with a laugh as he went back to helping malfoy battle marlene however remus who had seen him hit chloe with a stunner picked him up by the collar of his robes and punched him squarely in the jaw avery kicked his legs but remus didntput him down instead he threw him against a wall and pointed his wand at his throat i swear i will do it avery remus snarled you donthave the guts to want to inflict pain lupin avery taunted watch me remus replied as he began to mutter an incantation but before he could complete the curse lily stopped him he not worth it you are better than he is remus chloe wouldntwant you to lily whispered at these words remus shot ropes out of his wand and avery was quickly bound up and on the floor incapable of causing any more harm remus and lily surveyed the room to see where they were needed the most james and sirius were battling lucius and nott while alice and marlene seemed to be holding their own against crabbe and goyle everyone else was either stunned or tied up in ropes get chloe out of here and i ll go get a professor lily said to remus and he nodded in agreement he went over to chloe limp body and lifted her with little effort she felt so small to him and he desperately just wanted to kiss her and tell her everything was going to be okay he just knew that he had to get her to the hospital wing lily made sure no one would stop them as remus carried chloe out of the slytherin common room and up to the hospital wing lily was about to leave and go for help when a spell hit her from behind she had been tripped and as she looked up to see who had attacked her she just smiled severus snape had been tactfully avoiding any confrontation with the gryffindors because he knew his master would be displeased if he were to be seen his fellow slytherins were idiots and the dark lord would be very displeased because now they had been identified and bellatrix had been seen using an unforgivable curse however in order to protect his anonymity he was forced to act thought you would go get a professor and tell on us did you a voice said i afraid i cantallow that just try and stop me severus lily said as she pulled herself up from the ground without warning snape shot a jet of purple light out of his wand and lily collapsed to the ground unmoving and unconscious james saw this and let out a growl as he sprinted away from his duel with malfoy towards snape before he knew what hit him snape felt james fist connect with his stomach snape fell over backwards as he had the wind knocked out of him only a brute like you would use a fist instead of a wand potter severus spat as he tried to regain his composure you are lucky i didntsnivellus and if you ever touch a hair on her head again i wonthesitate to cause you severe pain from the tip of my wand james spat as he turned to check lily she had regained consciousness but had blood at the corners of her mouth she tried to speak but he told her not to as he placed a kiss of love on her forehead james lifted her into his arms to take her away from the battle i ve got to take lily to the hospital wing james shouted to sirius who was busy pummeling malfoy get alice and marlene and get out of here sirius reluctantly released malfoy from his curse and alice and marlene let crabbe and goyle down from the air the three gryffindors encircled the slytherins with their pointed directly at them dontmove or you will suffer the fate of my poor cousin bellatrix over there sirius said forcefully bellatrix was still out cold lying on the stone tiles near the fire place avery was tied up and narcissa was strapped to a chair nott was bleeding from an impediment curse that james had used to throw him against a wall somehow snape had managed to slink off to avoid being caught sirius looked around for alana but she had disappeared suddenly the portrait swung open and professor dumbledore along with the slytherin head of house walked through it dumbledore looked around and surveyed the damage a grim expression came over his face i afraid all of you will need to come with me miss prewitt would you be so kind as to untie miss black and mr avery mr nott i suggest you take yourself and bellatrix to the hospital wing dumbledore said with distress in his voice after everyone had been untied and revived sirius alice marlene malfoy crabbe goyle and narcissa followed dumbledore to his office while nott took bellatrix to the hospital wing lemon drop professor dumbledore said and the passageway to his office opened his pupils followed close behind until they reached the giant circular room mr black miss prewitt and miss mckinnon will you please follow me dumbledore said without the usual twinkle in his eye the rest of you stay here i will deal with you in a minute they entered his private quarters and dumbledore gestured for them to take a seat he settled himself into a large red chair and folded his hands in his lap he stared at the three students in front of him and only felt regret and sadness he felt regret that he couldntoffer them a safe world and sadness that they would have to fight for it i aware of what has occurred from a reliable source and you three do not need to explain yourselves i just thought you might need to hear this from me dumbledore started this is not the first battle you have fought and it will not be the last you have performed quite admirably and if it werentfor your bravery i afraid much worse could have happened sirius alice and marlene stared at dumbledore blankly they could not believe they werentbeing punished for attacking other students they also didntunderstand how dumbledore knew what had transpired in the dungeons sirius was the first to speak i dontunderstand professor why arentwe being punished he asked out of confusion would you like me to punish you mr black it is not in me to punish people who are fighting the good and just fight dumbledore said wisely the three looked at each other trying to comprehend the words of wisdom that their headmaster was imparting on them what will happen to the slytherins then professor surely they will be expelled marlene said dumbledore looked down at the ground and seemed almost ashamed for a minute he then looked the three students in the eye sometimes it is more helpful to refrain from strict punishments that will only breed resentment and anger you never want to alienate someone who could be a potential ally later on dumbledore said quietly after hearing these words sirius stood up and paced back and forth he shook with anger at the idea that a mad woman like bellatrix could get away with hurting his friends and not pay for it headmaster they attacked my friends they should have their wands broken why let future death eaters walk free sirius said trying hard not to shout my cousin and her lot will never falter from their cause be that as it may sirius my hands are tied in this matter and they will serve detention but that is all i can promise if you remember correctly i let you go without punishment once upon a time dumbledore countered sirius realized he had been beaten and took a seat next to alice however i would like to discuss something of importance with you dumbledore continued as you have just experienced we no longer live in a safe world while the ministry of magic is doing all it can to combat voldemort they suffer inefficiencies due to bureaucracy and because voldemort has spies there as well i would like to extend an invitation to you three to join the order of the phoenix the gryffindors looked at each other with surprised expressions sirius liked the idea of doing anything he could to help bring the downfall of voldemort he was already planning to apply for auror training however at the same time he was wary of joining a secret society without his mates will james remus peter and lily be invited as well sirius asked dumbledore let out a little chuckle he knew that the four marauders were not likely to be separated the precise reason he wanted them for the order other than their obvious talent was for their dedication and loyalty towards each other wouldntyou like me to explain what the objective of the order is first sirius dumbledore asked with mock surprise sirius nodded his head and dumbledore continued his explanation the order is a secret society that will have the mission of finding and exploiting the weaknesses of lord voldemort and his followers it will be dangerous and require a great deal of bravery danger is my middle name professor as long as my mates are invited to save my arse i am in sirius said without hesitation this is not a decision that can be made without a great deal of thought i will give you until the end of the year to think my proposal over we will speak again then i will speak with mr potter mr lupin mr pettigrew and miss evans in the near future about the order dumbledore replied as the twinkle returned to his eyes sirius alice and marlene sat in silence thinking over this momentous decision that would undoubtedly shape the rest of their lives dumbledore could see the strain they were under after having such a heavy burden placed on their shoulders and he thought it best to let them return to their dormitories and get some rest you may go back to gryffindor tower now but please think about what i have said dumbledore said and for the first time he looked like an old man with too much burdening him instead of the affable professor his students had always known him as the three gryffindors filed out of the headmaster office silently and chose not to speak as they made the long walk back to their beds all three just wanted to be left in peace as they were forced to contemplate their futures after hogwarts sirius realized he was not ready for bed yet and needed some time to think he knew that joining the order would mean fighting against his family his little brother regulus although james remus peter and lily were more of a family to him he didntknow if he had the will to cause his blood relatives pain and perhaps death could he pull a wand on his little brother i ll see you guys later i going to go check on james remus chloe and lily sirius lied as he left alice and marlene at the portrait hole he quickly turned a corner and started heading where his feet were taking him sirius realized for the first time that he would not be walking these halls again next year and the idea that he didntknow what his future had in store for him scared him he only had his friends to count on and for that he was thankful because he couldntask for a better bunch of people to face the dark times ahead with his care free days of pranking and trouble making seemed to be coming to an end as he was forced to face the realities of becoming an adult in his deep thoughts he hadntnoticed where he was going and when he took the time to absorb his surroundings he noticed that he was in the astronomy tower on further inspection he wasntalone he saw a small figure standing by the window looking out into the never ending darkness sirius recognized the long silky black hair and approached her but for once he didntuse any cheap lines or flirtatious innuendos thanks for warning us tonight sirius said quietly as he wasntsure alana wanted to be disturbed she turned around and sirius would see that her blue eyes were flooded with tears and the confident look she always wore was replaced by a vulnerable and frightened one just leave me alone sirius i not in the mood to be teased right now alana said stubbornly sirius took a seat on the windowsill next to her and they just sat their silent in the darkness although no words were exchanged the mere presence of each other company made them feel better sirius thought of his two families and which one was he willing to die for and alana thought of being torn between her sense of family and her moral obligation to do the right thing finally sirius spoke first never would have taken you for a slytherin you donthave the look in your eye like the rest of your lot sirius said blandly at this alana turned her bright eyes on sirius and curled her lips in anger you dontknow anything about me or what i stand for so please do not assume that my house is an accurate representation of who i am alana said angrily she wouldnttolerate sirius judging her because she was a slytherin she wasntlike the rest of them she didnthate muggles or muggleborns hadntshe just risked her own personal safety to save his friends i just saying that you dontseem like a slytherin that all sirius said apologetically dontpreach to me about being mis represented i do bare the name black after all alana continued to stare at sirius with her sharp blue eyes and he found himself feeling vulnerable it was as if she could read him like a book yet they barely knew each other are you that different from your cousins i see the way you walk around hogwarts as if you were the greatest wizard who walked through its halls in the last century you pick on those who are less powerful than you alana asked heatedly sirius couldntbear to be put in the same boat as his twisted cousin bellatrix and her unintelligent and weak sister narcissa he was not going to let alana think that he was similar to them practical jokes are a far cry from using unforgivable curses and discriminating against people solely on the basis of blood lineage i would never use my abilities to frighten or intimidate people and some of my closest friends are muggleborns sirius said darkly he was in no mood to justify himself to someone who he believed to be knee deep in the dark arts and death eater plots and who are you to judge seeing as you have such an intimate knowledge of my cousin inner circle should i check your arm for the death eater mark sirius replied haughtily alana whirled around and grabbed her wand out of her pocket she pointed it at sirius and looked at him with shock on her face how dare you accuse me of that after all i have done for your friends tonight i cantbelieve you would question my loyalties i may not wear them on my sleeve like an arrogant gryffindor but i am no supporter of lord voldemort alana cried tears built up in her eyes and fell down her porcelain cheeks sirius closed the gap between them and wrapped his arms around her despite her large personality she felt small pressed up against him to his surprise she didntpush him away but instead buried her head in his chest and cried shh i didntmean to upset you it ok sirius said as alana clung to him despite herself alana felt safe in sirius arms she knew he understood what she was going through and she prayed for his strength to make her own course in life and not be a pawn in her parents quest for power usually she kept her head down and hoped that the other members of her house didntnotice her but after tonight events she was sure that she would pay someone was bound to find out that she had alerted the gryffindors to their actions however her thoughts were interrupted when she felt sirius lips on hers his big hands were on the small of her back and she could feel his warm breath on her cold skin she found herself returning sirius kisses but quickly came to her senses and pulled away what the hell did you do that for alana demanded sirius looked at her and grinned he walked towards her but alana moved farther away he ran his hands through his dark hair and leaned up against a wall well i had to do something to get you to stop crying sirius protested but he couldnthide the smile on his lips you couldntjust keep your hands to yourself could you i not some weak girl who you can just take advantage of alana screeched however she found herself wanting desperately to be back in sirius arms for a brief moment all of her worries had left her mind as she had enjoyed a stolen kiss with someone she was all but forbidden from associating with i know that and it why i kissed you and i damn glad i did because i ve been wanting to do it for ages sirius replied simply alana was speechless she was torn between slapping sirius for his bold behavior and kissing him because he was so good at it however her pride won over in the end and she couldntlet sirius know that his kiss had affected her if we are going to be friends then you cantgo around kissing me you are just going to have to contain yourself alana replied cheekily sirius let out a deep laugh and his dark eyes sparkled with amusement he knew he had gotten under alana skin and he was thoroughly enjoying it he would wait for her because she was worth it but in the end they would kiss again they were perfect for each other no other woman challenged him the way she did but my plan worked didntit you canttell me you are thinking about whatever was making you cry now you know you enjoyed kissing me i quite skilled at it you know sirius said in jest that only because you ve snogged all of the girls in school and have had plenty of practice alana replied falling comfortably into their routine of banter and word play that just not true i would never take advantage of 11 year olds i after a real woman sirius said as he put his arm around alana alana giggled but slipped out from under sirius and returned to the seat by the window she had occupied earlier sirius joined her but instead of impinging on her personal space by trying to touch her he just sat comfortably next to her they spent the rest of the night getting to know each other as they talked endlessly about their separate histories and their uncertain futures author note once again sorry for the long period between updates i had this chapter finished two weeks ago but i decided to spill milk on my computer and so it had to go to the shop to get a new keyboard it took forever to get fixed and as a result i now have an english keyboard with a pound sign instead of a dollar sign anyways i hope you all like this chapter i know it seems like the slytherins never get punished and i hope that it isnta major flaw of the story but oh well sorry there wasntmuch lily and james in this chapter but have no fear they will be back in action soon and remus and chloe will have some stuff happen to them soon too on a side note i just realized that my pen name is chloe and one of my main characters is named chloe i not trying to write myself in to the story or anything i just simply didntrealize i had done that i know i a little slow sometimes so tell me what you think about this chapter andi will try and have more stuff up soon but i have spring break soon and i flying off to spain thanks for the lovely reviews of last chapter you guys rock remus sat solemnly by chloe bed in the hospital wing and held her hand tightly he felt as if he had seen the walls of this room too many times this year and prayed that this was the last he didntthink he could bear to see any more of his friends hurt and watching chloe who was not showing any signs of waking up was the most painful of all for no words could accurately describe the anguish a person feels while watching helplessly as the person you love lies unmoving in a hospital bed remus still had so much to tell her he needed her to know how much he loved her it was his fault she was lying in this bed if he hadntbeen so damn prideful chloe would be her usual happy and loving self and remus would take her in his arms and tell her how much she meant to him dontblame your self for this remus a voice said from behind him as he felt a comforting hand placed on his shoulder remus turned around and saw lily and smiled at her a disheartened smile you should be in a bed resting remus replied tiredly sleep was a foreign concept to him at this point he wondered if the fatigue would ever leave him lily pulled up a chair and planted herself next to remus as they both stared at chloe you sound just like james honestly you d think i was porcelain doll the way you all treat me i fine i more worried about you and chloe lily said with concern in her voice remus didntsay anything and they sat in comfortable silence just glad to know that they had good friends who they could lean on for support they had seen so much darkness this past year and thanked god that they had each other to get through everything that had been thrown in their paths after a while remus got up and put his jacket on and started to head for the door she wontwant to see me when she wakes up remus said trying to find an explanation for his sudden need to leave in reality he just couldnttake it any more he needed to go do something he couldntjust sit there and wait to see if she was alright she ll want you to be here she loves you remus even if it doesntseem like it right now it not her fault she said the things she did lily replied remus turned around at these words not because they intrigued him as it looked like lily might have a possible explanation for chloe behavior but because he was angry he was angry about the situation and lily just happened to be in his pathway of destruction well it certainly sounded like her voice when she told me she never wanted to see me again remus replied heatedly lily looked at remus with alarm for a minute she could see the werewolf in his eyes and it scared her however she knew that he needed her to be there for him bellatrix used her legilimancy and the imperious curse on her remus lily replied cryptically so no she really couldntcontrol what she was saying at this remus anger towards lily was redirected towards the slytherins lying in a bed across the room was theodore nott who was casually catching up on some reading for class remus took a few strides over to him and pulled out his wand and pointed it at his chest remus stood there with a menacing look in his eyes and then with all of his strength he punched nott in the face and continued to deliver blows to his helpless body you bloody bastard picking on people who are smaller than you think you are so superior to hell with you and your precious voldemort remus screamed as his fists connected with nott face lily watched on in horror and didntknow how to react part of her was glad to see nott get what he deserved after he had so mercilessly kicked james in the head but she couldntlet remus do this to himself she got up from where she was sitting and made her way over to the display to intervene however as she was about to throw herself between nott and remus fists someone else said something first remus lupin stop that this instant a voice said this got remus attention as both he and lily spun around and what they saw surprised them chloe was fully conscious and sitting up in bed but she didntlook happy she was staring daggers at remus and he immediately began to feel ashamed he didntknow what to say or how to act he was just relieved that chloe was awake however his joy was cut short as chloe continued to just stare at him with a vacant expression in her eyes he attempted to walk up to her but she held out a hand to stop him no please just leave remus you ve done enough was all that she said he turned around and exited the room with nothing but pain in his heart he looked back and saw chloe beautiful face void of any joy it was then he finally acknowledged the loss of chloe because he realized she would never be his again lily watched as remus dejectedly walked out of the room and then turned her eyes on chloe lily walked up to her best friend and took a seat next to her bed i just need to be alone right now lily i not in the mood to talk chloe said wearily as she played with the blankets in her lap lily could tell she was holding back her tears and gently placed her hand on top of chloe s chloe recoiled at first but then gradually relaxed lily just sat their in silence and knew that when chloe was ready to talk she would as the hours ticked by it became a battle of wills but lily was not about to lose this match finally chloe spoke and when she did all of the tears she had been holding back started to flow freely lily i so sorry chloe gasped in between sobs i am so weak lily got up and crawled onto the bed next to her friend and placed her arms around chloe small frame she let chloe cry on her shoulder nothing that happened is your fault chloe bellatrix took advantage of you at a vulnerable moment you arentto blame lily said soothingly but it didntconsole chloe she went after me because she knows i weak she used me to get to you james sirius and remus i put you all in danger chloe sobbed you should stay away from me stop it chloe if she had found me after i had just broken up with james i would have been easy to control as well you were upset but you are extremely powerful and james sirius remus and i know that lily countered at the mention of remus name chloe prickled she looked visibly pained and it was obvious that she still loved him he loves you chloe he just broke up with you to protect you from what he is but he regrets that now lily said as if she could read chloe thoughts chloe remained silent as she stared up at the ceiling he made it perfectly clear for me to leave him alone and that is what i intend to do he wants nothing to do with me and i want nothing to do with him chloe replied somewhat cryptically that rubbish and you know it he loves you he hasntleft your side this entire time you ve been in hospital he was the one who brought you here of course only after he hexed avery into the next century for using a stunner on you lily said trying to lighten the mood at the image of remus acting even remotely violent she smiled a bit despite their problems remus was the kindest person she had ever met no matter what may have been i too much of a danger to him now if things are meant to work out they will but only after i learn to be stronger on my own chloe said you are strong chloe dontever doubt that lily said defiantly i sorry for everything lily i really am you are my best friend and i ll never forget that chloe said as she began to wipe her eyes on her sleeves i just glad to have you back chlo lily said as she hugged her best friend this time tears were starting to build in her eyes you gave us quite a scare there the next day sirius and james were walking down the corridors on their way to the kitchens they had both served detention for slipping professor mcgonagall a potion that made her grow a beard while it seemed childish they full heartedly believed that in times of darkness sometimes laughter was the best medicine and they were determined to leave hogwarts with a bang they were both quite hungry however as they were forced to skip dinner but luckily they knew the way to the kitchen by heart mcgonagall is going to be in a right strop with us after that stunt mate sirius guffawed awe she has a soft spot for us any how i mean how else can you explain how we haventbeen expelled yet pad james replied with a grin as he slapped sirius on the shoulder i think she has a crush on wormtail and that why she lets us get away with murder after all he is her favorite student sirius said sarcastically the two continued on their merry way as they told jokes and made fun of each other however sirius turned around when he heard voices coming from the hallway next to them he motioned for james to be quiet and they made their way over to where the commotion was coming from i ll do what i please thank you very much and i d appreciate it if you kept your nose out of my business a cool female voice said i dontinterfere in whatever it is that you do with your free time sirius and james arrived just in time to see snape grab the person who the voice belonged to and shove her into a wall we dontneed trouble and that is what all of this will bring so you better stop now before it goes any further snape said in a dangerously low voice geroff me the girl said that was enough for james and sirius as they decided to make their presence known oye snivellus it about past your bedtime i suggest you scamper back to your common room sirius said as he lit his wand to see who snape was intimidating to his horror he realized that the girl was alana however she didntlook scared instead she had a rather livid expression on her face this is none of your business black so you and potter stay out of it snape replied angrily well as it so happens james and i here happen to make it our business when beautiful young women are being intimidated by greaseballs like you so let her go or else sirius said warningly it was at this point that alana decided to weigh in sirius please just leave us you will only make matters worse alana said pleadingly not until i know that you are okay sirius replied as he trained his wand on snape i fine just go alana repeated no i not going to leave you here with this creep sirius said snape just looked on in amusement is this the kind of company you keep dear sister someone who thinks you are too weak to defend yourself i always thought you were stronger than that snape said in order to antagonize both alana sirius however sirius just stared at him in stunned silence snape knew that his words had had their intended effect sister sirius said as he looked between alana and snape twin sister to be exact or did she fail to mention that during your midnight rendezvous in the astronomy tower snape cackled sirius looked at alana for an explanation surely the beautiful creature that stood before him couldntbe related to some one as ugly and evil as severus snape snape was up to his eyeballs in the dark arts and probably was a death eater all ready was it possible that alana was one as well is that true alana sirius said hoarsely how could you not tell me i told you i wasntproud of my family alana replied as she glared at her brother snape circled around them as he laughed but james quickly checked him against a wall tell your brute friend to get off of me black or i will tell my dear sister here what a real menace you are snape said warningly by the time i through she ll want nothing to do with you ever again get over your school boy grudge severus alana replied as she decided to leave the scene wait alana you owe me an explanation sirius said as he grabbed her hand she pulled away and mildly smiled at him i dontowe you anything sirius i am what i am alana said and with that she disappeared down the dark hall james reluctantly let go of snape and as he did snape brushed his robes off as if he had been touched by dirt if you are fond of my sister you will leave her alone no good can come for her if she continues to consort with the likes of you snape spat as he stared at sirius alana is a big girl and can see whoever she wants snivellus now run along before we decide to hang you upside down by your underwear again sirius replied with an equal amount of venom snape clenched his fists as he grudgingly recalled the terrible events of fifth year where his underwear had been exposed to the entire school he glared at sirius and james but realized he was outnumbered just stay away from her black snape said as he retreated into the darkness just as his sister had done when they were alone sirius turned to james and smiled sadly well that that then i guess sirius said rather dejectedly sorry mate rough break who would have known a good looking girl like that is related to a git like snivellus james said sympathetically as he put his arm around his friend sirius looked at his shoes and couldnthelp but feel disappointed alana was the first girl he had ever felt any sort of connection with life just wasntfair he thought to himself she just had to be the sister of his sworn enemy didntshe i really fancied her you know she was the only girl who could properly kick my arse well besides lily and she hopelessly head over heals for you sirius said as he tried to manage a grin james realized this was the first time he had ever heard sirius actually talk seriously about a girl they came and went and sirius never looked back but he seemed genuinely upset about this one as much as it pained him to see his best mate get mixed up with someone from the same gene pool as a slime ball like snape he realized what he had to do if you like the girl then why let someone like snape get in your way you like a challenge why let this one obstacle stop you now james reasoned however the words were like acid coming out of his mouth he just groaned at the remote possibility that sirius and alana could one day get married and then he would actually have to be civil to snape he tried not to think about it because it gave him the shivers however his words did have an effect on sirius as he turned and looked at james with an expression of excitement on his face yeah and what better way to piss snape off then to snog his sister sirius said gleeful as if a giant light bulb had just gone off in his head same old padfoot always out for a shag i think you might want more from this one mate james replied with a laugh now dontgo saying that too loud or word might get out and my reputation could be tarnished forever sirius said as they reached the statue that they needed to press to get into the kitchen lily woke up early the next morning she had tried to fall back asleep but she had too much weighing on her mind thoughts raced around in her head and made it impossible to relax so she got up out of her bed and pulled on a sweater as she planted her feet on the cold ground she looked across the room to see chloe sleeping soundly lily desperately wanted to talk to her but decided that she probably needed her rest so she silently crept out of the room and headed downstairs to catch up on some studying she found a seat by the window and stared out of it as the sun started to rise hey a voice said and lily turned around to see james she smiled and made room for him to sit down next to her he put his arms around her and they sat there comfortably in the early morning silence what are you doing up so early mr potter lily asked as she kissed him lightly on the lips james kissed her back and held her closer to him she could feel his muscular chest through his thin t shirt i holding quidditch practice this morning and sirius snores like a bear and it makes it impossible to stay asleep james said as he ran his hand through his messy hair lily laughed a little as she rested her head on james chest and closed her eyes why are you up james asked sleepily as he let out a yawn just thinking about stuff lily said nonchalantly james ears perked up as he knew this was the perfect time to score some boyfriend points he might even get a nice snogging session afterwards if he listened to lily now he thought to himself what are you thinking about lilikins james asked as he kissed lily neck lily looked at him and he immediately realized that whatever was on her mind must be serious her sparkling green eyes were filled with worry dumbledore asked me to join the order lily said honestly as she looked at james hazel eyes james expression turned into a pained one his parents had been members of the order of the phoenix and a lot of good that did them it was dangerous business fighting against voldemort and his followers he sirius and remus had already decided to join but he didntwant lily to be put at such a great risk the thought of her in any danger terrified him and if the worst should happen and he lost her he didntthink he could recover however this was a delicate situation if he put his foot down and said no she would join just to spite him he had to be tactful you arentjoining lily it too dangerous james said too hell with tact he thought lily expression turned from love to incredulity she couldntbelieve james could be such a cave man she was just as powerful as he was she had fought beside him all year long how dare he tell her what to do are you forbidding me james lily asked as her temper began to flare james stood up and towered over her lily jumped up but realized that she didnthave much of advantage as she only came up to his chest she put her hands on her hips and her eyes sizzled with anger that right i am you dontknow what you are getting yourself into james said dismissively lily was even more angered that he wasnttaking her seriously well last time i checked you arentthe boss of me so i will be damned if you think you can tell me what to do lily spat you cantjoin i ll tell dumbledore not to let you james countered it was a childish response but it was the best thing he could think of your debating skills have really gone down hill potter honestly dumbledore was the one who asked me to join you arrogant prat he wontlisten to you lily replied this isntup for discussion lils james said as he started to walk away lily ran and jumped on him although she was small she was strong and she soon tackled him to the ground dontwalk away from me when we are fighting and dontcall me lils lily said as she sat on top of james and attempted to pin his wrists to the ground normally i would like the idea of you being on top of me james said with a laugh lily became infuriated as james laughed at her she whacked him in the chest and then stood up this was the most important decision of her life and he wasntlistening to her instead he was stomping around like an alpha male thumping his chest in an attempt to exert his dominance you james harold potter are a complete toerag and if you understood me at all you would realize how important this is to me lily said as tears began to flow down her cheeks she turned on her heal and fled the common room and ran as fast as she could to get away from james james just stood their completely dumbstruck and couldntfigure out where he had gone wrong he put his head in his hands and groaned as he realized that he had made an utter mess out of things it was going to take some doing to make this up to lily they had never had such a row since they had started dating he forgot how stubborn she could be then again he was pretty stuck in his ways as well i think you lost her when you said and i quote you arentjoining lily isnttoo keen on having people tell her what to do remus said as he came down the stairs james turned around and gave his friend a half hearted smile you heard all of that huh james said limply the whole tower heard you two screaming at each other like an old married couple sirius said as he followed remus down the spiral staircase i especially liked the part where she jumped on top of you that was pretty hot she fiery james just groaned again and looked at the portrait hole praying that lily would walk back through it however she didntand he was left alone to wallow in his own self pity i ve made a royal mess of things haventi james to sirius and remus remus who was the more eloquent of the two spoke first as he took a seat on the windowsill that james was sitting on you could have been a bit more careful in your choice of words remus replied trying to sound supportive however sirius was never one to beat around the bush you were a real horse arse you had a hot girl straddling you and yet you managed to chase her off in tears that is a new low for you prongise sirius said as he rummaged through his pockets for something to eat james threw a pillow at his friend which forced sirius to drop the chocolate bar he was currently enjoying hey that was my last chocolate frog sirius cried indignantly piss off was all james could say dontbe in a strop with me because you cantkeep your woman in line sirius said as he dusted his frog off and continued to eat it james and remus looked on in disgust well at least i not in love with a girl version of snivellus james said however he had taken it too far as sirius lunged for him and chaos ensued the three seventeen year old boys who were each over six feet tall were wrestling on the ground fighting like cats and dogs remus was trying desperately to separate james and sirius but ended up receiving most of the blows james and sirius attempted to kick and punch each other but when they were all out of breath and lying on the floor panting for air they started to laugh i guess i should figure out how to get myself out of this mess james said finally as he managed to catch his breath i d suggest diamonds and large ones sirius said and james punched him in the shoulder for his impertinence you are definitely in the dog house this time author note i know it has been awhile but honestly i have really busy first there was spain then my parents came to visit i hope everyone likes this chapter i will try and update again soon but i have finals coming up and then its time to return to the good ol us of a some freaking sunshine for a change not that i dontlove london but i

anyways enjoy and post some reviews because they do make me happy when the rain keeps pouring down love you all professor dumbledore sat in his office scrawling a quick note to a friend when he heard a knock at the door he lifted his eyes from the piece of parchment before him and saw chloe standing in the doorway he smiled at her and motioned for her to sit down she looked nervous but took a seat in front of the headmaster and nervously wrung her hands i glad you came for a visit miss stepford i think it is about time we talked what can i do for you dumbledore asked congenially chloe looked at her feet then back up at dumbledore as she tried to find the words she desperately needed to get out dumbledore just looked at her with a friendly smile on his face and before she knew it she was talking i wanted to talk about what happened last week between me and bellatrix black chloe said gaining confidence go on miss stepford dumbledore encouraged her chloe eyes began to fill with tears but she fought them back as she didntwant dumbledore to think she was an emotional mess it my fault that my friends were in danger if i werentso weak i could have prevented the whole thing i dontwant to jeopardize my friends ever again chloe said rather quickly ah yes i am assuming you are referring to miss evans mr lupin mr potter and mr black am i right dumbledore asked yes and alice and marlene as well they are all very important people to me and i would never be able to live with myself if something happened to them because of my inability to stand up to people i need your help professor chloe said somewhat determinedly dumbledore looked at his young pupil before him with concern and a grave expression fell over his face you are not weak miss stepford dontever let someone make you feel inferior to them i ve watched you develop your talents over the years and you are one of the cleverest witches in the school dumbledore said in an attempt to console chloe that not enough professor i want to study occlumency chloe said i never want to let someone control me again voldemort wants my friends for whatever reason he has and i cantbetray them i need to be strong for them and protect their secrets chloe said firmly dumbledore looked at the intent young woman before him and stroked his long beard as he pondered what she was asking him why miss stepford are you not asking to learn legilimancy as well surely both skills would benefit you dumbledore asked chloe looked at him with surprise and didntquite no how to answer it seemed an odd question to pose professor i have no desire to look into the thoughts of others only to be able to protect my own chloe said quietly dumbledore eyes began to twinkle with excitement as he nodded his head as if chloe had passed a test that is very wise miss stepford and we can begin your occlumency classes immediately i will teach you myself please come to my office tomorrow night so that we can get started dumbledore said as he reached over and patted faux the phoenix head chloe expression turned from determination into glee as she jumped up and hugged the old man thank you so much professor chloe said happily chloe turned to leave the office when dumbledore said something that made her turn around you are brave and loyal miss stepford and have the true heart of a gryffindor dumbledore said she looked at him with gratitude in her eyes and smiled thank you professor chloe repeated again but his words meant more to her than he would ever know as she walked back to the common room she couldnthelp but feel a little more cheerful at the idea that she would learn to protect her friends she entered the common room and it looked as if everyone had gone to bed she sat down on the couch because she wasntready to go to bed yet her mind was racing with thoughts and she didnthear the portrait hole open hello chloe remus said quietly he had been in the library studying and just returned to get some sleep he couldntseem to get enough of it these days chloe turned and smiled at him and his heart skipped a beat for a moment he thought the old chloe was back but tried desperately not to get his hopes up hi remus chloe said nonchalantly as if she didnteven think anything of his presence in reality the mere sound of his voice gave her goose bumps she knew she would never stop loving him but she wasntgoing to allow herself to get hurt again she doubted very much that things could return to normal it was too late now he didntknow what made him do it but he walked over to where chloe was sitting and spit out what was on his mind he needed to know if she still loved him he needed to know that in the end they would be together can we talk remus asked hastily chloe looked reluctant but made room for remus to sit next to her and he sat down and the mere closeness of him made her stomach flutter remus was finding it very hard not to just kiss chloe but he didntwant to scare her off instead he just sat close to her and hoped that the mutual chemistry they had would take its course you wanted to say something remus chloe said as he just sat there and stared at him she couldnthelp but smile his awkwardness reminded her of that first night they had spent in the library together where he had lost all cool around her yes remus said resolutely i just wanted to say that for whatever it is worth i am sorry for acting like such a coward and for closing you out chloe absorbed these words and couldnthelp but be disappointed by them he wasntlike james or sirius that wore their hearts on their sleeves he was guarded and what she wanted more than anything was to see his passion instead he just looked at her with his cool gray eyes as he chose his words carefully so as not to divulge his true feelings chloe didntquite know how to respond thanks was all chloe could say as she tried to conceal the sadness in her voice was that all taking a hint from chloe cool tone remus got up from the couch and rubbed the back of his neck as he prepared to head up to his bedroom yeah i guess so remus said quietly so that it then chloe said as she studied remus exhausted face she got up from the couch in an attempt to retire to her dorm room but she found herself staring at remus despite the line of fatigue on his face he was still handsome to her his shaggy brown hair and gray eyes made her heart melt she wanted desperately to be his again but she held herself back she needed to know that she could be strong on her own i guess so remus replied lamely well i ll see you around then remus chloe said as she turned to face the roaring fire again not wanting remus to see the tears in her eyes remus looked at the back of chloe head and realized that if he didntdo something now he would lose her forever for once in his life he wished he had the bravado of james or sirius no that not it remus said suddenly as he walked over to chloe and pulled her to him he stared down into her deep blue eyes and impulsively brought his lips to hers to his surprise she was kissing him back remus warm kiss sent shivers of happiness throughout chloe body as she let her instincts take over they stood in an embrace kissing passionately until they could no longer breathe as soon as chloe looked up in to remus eyes she pulled away immediately i cantremus chloe said as tears began to role down her cheeks you hurt me more than you will ever know and i dontknow if i can do it again remus looked at her and extended his hand to grab hers he just needed to touch her i promise that i will never hurt you again i love you chloe remus said with passion in his voice chloe stared at remus in surprise why was he doing this to her he was making it so easy for her to just run back to him but she couldn t if he really loved her he was just going to have to wait for her i need time remus chloe said as she looked into his pleading eyes perhaps after she learned occlumency things would be different but for now she needed to be by herself if that what you want i will wait for you but i wontstop loving you remus said as he walked up to chloe and stood within inches of her face it took all of her willpower not to kiss him as she felt his hot breath on her skin and smelled his familiar scent there they stood with their lips practically touching as they just stared at each other finally remus placed an endearing kiss on chloe forehead and pulled away i ll be waiting for you love remus said as he walked up the stairs to his bedroom he had to congratulate himself on his new found ability to cease the day perhaps james and sirius were rubbing off on him he thought as he crawled into bed he couldnthelp but be pleased with how the evening had gone he knew chloe still loved him he could feel it when she had kissed him he just had to let her sort things out he would just have to be patient on the other side of the tower chloe lay in her bed wide awake as she replayed the kiss with remus over and over again in her head it had felt so right but she knew that it wasntthe right time for them she just hoped that remus would wait for her again lily woke up early in the morning but this time it was so she could avoid james she hadntspoken to him for almost a week and she wasntgoing to make the first move either she was still furious at him for being so controlling at first she was sure that james would have come running to her with flowers and chocolates to apologize for being a prat however it had been 5 days since the fight and they hadntspoken since she was starting to wonder if they were breaking up but she was too stubborn to find out instead she was forced to endure watching james flirt with other girls and ignore her presence whenever she was in the room for instance she had walked in to the common room after attempting to study in the library and she saw james in extremely close proximity to amelia bones she tried to convince herself that they were just talking quidditch but when she saw james put his arm around amelia she began to doubt that explanation he didntsit next to her in class and at meal times he sat at the opposite end of the table from her lily thought about all of this as she quietly made her way down to the great hall for breakfast she just hoped that james wasntup yet because she didntthink she could take another meal where they ignored each other this was what she had been afraid of before she went out with james that he would break her heart now that she had given her heart to him he seemed to be ditching her and moving on she had even heard rumors that he had been caught snogging a ravenclaw in a broom closet the other day it was all getting to be too much for lily and she was miserable she sat alone at the long table as she ate her breakfast quickly and in silence she hoped that if she was fast enough she wouldnthave to see james as she sat there staring at the porridge in front of her a large tawny colored owl swooped down and dropped something in front of her lily looked at the mail she had received and it was a letter written in scratchy handwriting dear lily will you meet me after quidditch practice tonight in the common room i think we should talk send a letter letting me know if you can james lily stared at it and a tear slipped down her cheek this was it james was going to break it off with her he hadnteven signed the letter love james it was cryptic and unfeeling and that only meant one thing it was over lily penned a short reply that said she would try and make it but she had patrolling duties she didntwant to let james know that she was devastated she attached the letter to the owl leg and then attempted to make a swift exit from the dinning hall however her efforts were thwarted when she bumped into none other than james and his friends she was nearly knocked off her feet as she collided with james but he swiftly caught her she fell into his arms and stared into his eyes but then quickly snapped back to reality she pulled away from james and without a word left him as she returned to the tower to get her books before class are you going to do it tonight remus asked as they found seats at the table yeah it seems most appropriate dontyou think james said as he started to put food on his plate good it just mean to lead her on the way you have been sirius said as he shoveled some sausage into his mouth sirius please refrain from speaking when you are chewing no one wants to the full contents of your breakfast remus said as he looked disgustedly at his friend that night lily walked as slowly as possible as she traveled down the corridors with gideon she thought that the longer she took would mean the longer she was james girlfriend gideon dumbledore asked you and dorcas to join the order and you didntstomp around like a gorilla forbidding her to join lily said out of frustration gideon looked at her and smiled yeah but it doesntmean i thrilled with the idea that she is going to put herself at risk gideon said as he kicked open a broom closet to make sure no one was snogging inside james forbid me and when i said he couldnttell me what to do he completely ignored me and now he going to break up with me lily said as tears began to stream down her face gideon put a comforting arm around lily as she started to cry uncontrollably i hate him lily said in between her tears you donthate him and that why it hurts so much gideon said sympathetically as he pulled lily into a hug let get you back to the common room you are in no state to patrol tonight lily protested because she didntwant to face james but gideon grabbed her hand and despite her kicking and punching she couldntstop him gideon said the password to the gryffindor common room and walked in james was sitting in an arm chair waiting for lily to get back when gideon appeared with a crying lily dragging her heals behind him he pushed her forward and looked at james who was staring at lily your problem mate you fix it was all gideon said as he disappeared through the portrait hole lily was sitting on the couch trying to compose herself she wiped the tears from her face and ran her fingers through her messy hair in an attempt to tame her fiery locks james approached her and sat down beside her on the couch lily we need to talk can we go somewhere james asked no i fine where i am thank you lily said spitefully james let out a laugh and grabbed lily hand and started to drag her out of the room let go of me you jerk lily swore i dontwant to make a scene here and you are being hysterical just come with me james said as lily protested violently i not going anywhere with you lily said with determination at that james moved closer to lily until he was inches from her face lily felt like she couldntbreathe as they stared at each other her heart beat started to increase and she could feel the heat between them and then he picked her up and threw her over his shoulder as she wasntvery big he didntwant to argue with her james potter put me down this instant lily shouted not until you calm down and start acting rationally james said angrily as he tried to hold lily still i am rational you are the one who has been acting like a complete bastard lily yelled she was so busy being angry at james that she didntnotice where he was taking her it wasntuntil she felt the cool air hit her skin that she noticed they were outside the castle and heading towards the quidditch pitch i demand to know where you are taking me lily said furiously hold your horses you will see in a second have a little patience evans james said gruffly his arms were starting to get tired and he hadntcounted on lily putting up such a fight yet he could see their destination in site finally he put lily down and when he did she grew very quiet before them was a blanket with rose pedals strewn across it lily saw a picnic basket and somehow the air seemed warmer where she was standing she heard music playing softly in the back ground as she looked up at the stars she turned to look at james who was staring at her with a smile on his face what is all this lily asked quietly a little embarrassed that she had made such a scene well lil if you would have checked your calendar you would have realized that today is valentine day james said with a smile lily was speechless and then she turned bright red in embarrassment so i guess that means you arentbreaking up with me lily said sheepishly james pulled lily to him and gave her a kiss on the lips what would give you the idea that i d go and do something as stupid as that james laughed as he cupped lily face in his hands and placed another kiss on her forehead lily didntreally want to tell james how she had arrived at that conclusion because then it would have proved him right that she had been irrational i dontwant to tell you because it sounds stupid lily said playfully as she ran her hand through james hair james knew just the way to get lily to confess so he began to tickle her mercilessly she screamed and giggled and tried to run away but he wouldntlet her tell me james said as lily shrieked with laughter never lily shouted back they both ended up lying on the blanket lying on their backs looking up at the stars lily put her head on james chest and he wrapped his arms around her i love you lily james said as he kissed her hair lily bolted upright and stared at james who was still lying down then why did you ignore me all week and flirt with every girl in school i saw you with amelia bones lily finally said she knew that she had ruined the moment but they needed to talk about it she needed to understand why james had acted the way he had she had to be able to trust him james looked at her and scratched the back of his head as he tried to figure out what lily was going on about he vaguely remembered talking to amelia about the upcoming match but he didntflirt with her he knew that much in fact it had been the hardest week of his life trying to give lily her space it was remus idea but all he wanted to do was beg lily for forgiveness amelia bones that cow lily you cantlisten to every rumor about me that silly jealous girls spread around school you know i love you i was just giving you some space so you could cool down and i needed to think some stuff through james said as he sat up and put his arm around lily she leaned her head on his shoulder and tears started to fall she didntmean to cry but she couldntstop herself all of the emotions she had been holding in for the past week suddenly poured out i love you lily i sorry if i did anything to hurt you james said as he stroked lily hair and kissed her on the forehead lily looked up at james with her sparkling green eyes and her lip started to tremble why cantyou understand why i need to join the order lily said as she turned away from james and pulled her knees to her chest james gently put his hand on her shoulder but she shrugged it off all of this is very sweet james but it doesntchange the fact that you dontunderstand me lily whispered again james tried to find the words he was looking for because in reality he did understand why lily wanted to join the order lils i know it is important to you and i sorry about before it just that you are in so much more danger than most witches or wizards because you are a muggleborn and you are so powerful if anything ever happened to you i dontknow what i d do with myself james said lily turned around to face him and when she did he pulled her towards him and held her tightly but it because i a muggleborn that i have to do this if i dontfight to stop voldemort from terrorizing muggles and muggleborns then i am just as guilty as if i were a death eater myself lily said defiantly james knew that he would lose lily if he didntstop being so selfish he knew that no matter what he couldntalways protect her i know lils and i sorry for being such an arse as selfish as it sounds i already lost my parents to voldemort and i want to keep the people i love as far away from him as possible because i wouldntbe able to handle another loss like that james said as he remembered his mother and father a flash of his mother body lying unmoving on the grass in front of his house passed through his mind and he shivered he would never get over losing his parents then why is it ok for sirius remus and peter to join the order and not me lily countered james didntreply for a minute as he was still remembering the death of his parents was it worth it to sacrifice your life and to endanger your loved ones just to stand up for what you believe james tried to think about what his father would have told him what to do and then he remembered that his father chose the cause over his family but the more james thought about it not fighting against voldemort would mean that his children would have to grow up in a world of fear and that he owed it to them to make their lives safer i dontlike that either but if i have to do this then i wouldntwant anybody else besides them with me james said let me be by your side as well i love you james i wouldntbe able to live with myself if something happened and i wasntthere to help you lily said earnestly as she played with james unruly hair it not safe lil was all that james said as he stared off across the lake but he knew he was fighting a losing battle when lily put her mind to something there was no stopping her but being in the order and having the protection of dumbledore you sirius remus and peter is the best way for me to stay safe lily said rationally as she looked at james haunted face she knew he was thinking about his parents because he always had the same expression on his face that was twisted in pain there was nothing she could do to bring back his parents but she would fight against the people who murdered them i love you lily you are the strongest person i know james said as he kissed lily on the lips i guess we are in this together at least we can protect each other i love you too james and thanks for understanding lily finally said as she leaned into james and kissed him passionately they leaned back on to the blanket and held each other as they continued to exchange kisses both knew that they had made a huge decision but what is right is not always easy author note what better way to procrastinate so i donthave to write my paper then updating my story honestly i only have two more weeks left in london am i really expected to get work done during that time that just ridiculous anyways heres a rather sappy chapter but i am in a romantic mood and so the characters are as well no sirius or alana in this chapter but there will be more of them comming up sorry i dontwrite much about peter but he sucks so i dontreally care just assume that he around just being a pest alright well that it for now please read and review i really enjoy them i will try and update again soon hasta alana hated it when people tried to tell her what to do even more so she got quite annoyed if someone tried to interrupt her studies so when bellatrix black took the book that was on her lap and threw it on the ground alana deep blues eyes flashed with anger and she immediately felt around for her wand that was sitting in her pocket i know it was you who alerted my esteemed cousin and his miscreant friends to our actions bellatrix said in a low and extremely threatening voice for as long as alana could remember bellatrix black had been a bully and it was her greatest weakness her inability to control her emotions made her reckless and therefore a danger to herself and those around her to make matters worse bellatrix happened to keep a very close eye on alana she didnttrust alana loyalties to her house or her family although alana had done never anything to prove bellatrix correct she also hadntproven her wrong either the two girls had a rather frosty relationship that was not helped by bellatrix jealousy when it came to alana natural abilities with magic nice to see you too alana said as she bent over to pick her book up off the ground bellatrix was extremely annoyed that alana wasntchallenging her after suffering humiliation at the hands of the gryffindors bellatrix was looking for an excuse to hex someone and she had rather hoped that alana might be her target the girl did posses an uncanny knack for staying under the radar which made bellatrix suspect her all the more i d be careful if i were you just because your family is loyal to the cause doesntget you a get out of jail free card the dark lord sees everything and he knows who his true servants are bellatrix said as she pointed an accusing finger at alana alana simply smiled pleasantly well i d watch your back then bellatrix because the dark lord particularly despises those who are tactless and get caught in the act and worse are then subsequently beaten alana said smoothly as she looked back down at the piece of parchment in front of her bellatrix balled her fingers into a fist and glowered at alana she let out a shriek of frustration and then turned on her heel and left the room oh and be a love and shut the door on your way out thank you and goodbye alana said as bellatrix stomped away alana went back to staring at her assignment for potions but she couldnthelp but feel restless she was tired of avoiding her house and hiding in her room in an effort to keep herself from getting sucked into voldemort plan like her brother she wasntlike everyone in her house she didntcare about muggleborns purity or in her brother case power but doubts about her true nature continued to plague her as she was forced to face the fact that the sorting hat had placed her in slytherin scared to let her natural abilities take over alana kept her guard up and never let anyone in her thoughts drifted to sirius and although she hated to admit it he had courage unlike her he stood up to his family and chose not to follow in the footsteps of hundreds of generations of blacks yes well it easy when you are an arrogant git who doesntcare about anyone but himself alana whispered under her breath not really believing what she was saying she knew that being a death eater was much more selfish and egotistical then fighting for equality as sirius proclaimed he was doing talking about me again are you a deep voice said and alana whipped around to see something hovering at her window what makes you think you are on my mind at all alana said saucily as she came face to face with sirius black sorry i hear someone being called a git and i automatically assume it me sirius said with a smile now are you going to let me in or should i just sit out here and freeze sirius had been sitting around staring at a homework assignment which he believed to be pointless and on a whim decided to borrow james broom and go for a ride well he was using the term borrow loosely as he had nicked it from james trunk which required the use of his lock picking pocket knife but that was really splitting hairs the important thing was that as soon as he had mounted the broom he felt the urge to visit a particular raven haired beauty who had been avoiding him for the past week cantyou use a door like normal people alana said as she unlocked her window where would be fun in that sirius asked with pretend confusion he floated through the window and then jumped off his broom and took off robes as they were a tad damp he caught alana smiling and grinned at her dontget any ideas miss snape just because i am in your bedroom and the door is closed and probably locked doesntmean you can take advantage of me sirius quipped as he ran his hands through his hair i ve had many ideas in my life sirius and you can trust me when i say that hasntbeen one of them alana laughed as she plopped down on her bed now what do you want because i was in the middle of something very important sirius grabbed the piece of parchment that was sitting on alana lap and started to read it out loud ten things i love about sirius black by alana snape he is quite fit he has a cute bottom he is the most powerful wizard in the universe whenever i see him i want to but alana had grabbed the piece of paper from him and hit him with a pillow the only word that describes you properly in this essay is ragweed you prat this is my potions homework or are you that delusional alana said as her eyes sparkled with amusement sirius was about to make a witty comeback when he heard padfoot likes to wear women underwear echoing from his pocket he quickly grabbed the hand held mirror and james face stared back at him alana couldnthelp but laugh see lils i told you that would get his attention james turned to his side and said but then quickly turned back to face his friend well you have my attention now so what is it that gave you the urge to make up such utter lies about me sirius said in mock contempt lily remus peter chloe marlene and i wanted to know if you are up for a game of capture the wand james asked as he ran his hands through his messy hair in an attempt to tae it sirius could hear lily in the background as she told him it was a hopeless cause however his eyes lit up when he heard james mention his favorite game they had been playing since they were first years and sirius never turned down a game meet me and alana in the 7th floor corridor in five minutes and you are going down sirius said as he shoved the mirror back in his pocket alana stared at him blankly but sirius grabbed james broom with one hand and used the other one to drag alana behind him sirius i donthave time for games alana yelled as sirius guided her down the stairs from her bedroom into the slytherin common room people stared at him as if he was a ghost and sirius shouted cheekily i taking alana hostage to pay you dolts back for being such ugly wankers luckily they ducked out of the room before an array of hexes was hurled at them sirius laughed like a maniac as they sprinted down the hallway let go of me alana complained as she tried to drag her heals unfortunately sirius was stronger than her and had also used a charm to seal their hands together alana found this out when she tried to slip away and was unable to separate her hand from sirius you bound us together you prat alana screeched be quiet or you will get us in trouble sirius said nonplused that alana was digging her nails into the skin on his wrist suddenly they came to an abrupt halt and sirius pulled out his wand and peered around the corner he was too slow however as a huge welt appeared on his arm i hit you first so that means i get to pick first james said as stepped out of the shadows with the rest of the 7th year gryffindors behind him what a civilized game this is lily said sarcastically as james performed a simple healing charm on sirius he began to explain how the game was played according to the rules of the game the person who hit the other person with a stinging hex first got to pick first when it came to forming teams since james and sirius had invented the game they were naturally the captains of each team the rest of the game was rather simple to understand it was similar to capture the flag except that the opposing teams could use a variety of hexes and curses to impede the progress of their opponents the first team to find the hidden wand and take it back to their base won however no one was really thinking about teams at this point they were all staring at alana what is the snivellete doing here peter asked accusingly as he sneered at alana sirius punched peter hard in the arm just for that peter i putting her in charge of knocking your ass out sirius said angrily alana blushed furiously and turned to walk away however lily quickly stepped in her path and held out her hand hi i lily it nice to finally meet you she said and dontmind peter he just protective of his friends alana shook lily hand and everyone proceeded to do the same alright everyone stop hitting on my girlfriend and let form the bloody teams already sirius yelled as he saw peter hold on to alana hand for what seemed like a prolonged period alana quickly pulled her hand away and then used it to swat sirius in the head i not your girlfriend you git alana said trying not to allow a smile to play upon her lips sirius slung his arm around her shoulder and then kissed her on top of the head we ll see about that love sirius said with a grin everyone tried hard not to laugh when they noticed that alana had charmed sirius shirt to read i love slytherins james made the first pick of the evening and he chose remus lily stared daggers at him how could you not pick your own girlfriend she said quite furiously because if we are on different teams then i can finally show you that i am better at dueling than you are you still owe me a rematch from the dueling club championship james said with a cocky grin lily just stared at him with her hands on her hips and then shook her head like i said before you ll be looking up at me from your backside lily promised as she joined forces with sirius does that mean you ll be on top of me then because i rather like that idea james replied as she chose marlene for his next pick lily just glared at him and turned bright red the teams were quickly formed and it was sirius lily alana and chloe against james remus marlene and peter peter tried hard not to take it the wrong way when he was the last person picked the group then split up and went to their bases in preparation for the game to start you three just follow my lead and back me up when i say so and i ll take care of the rest sirius said as he began doling out assignments in an attempt to form a strategy all three girls looked at sirius reproachfully what no good sirius asked shocked that his teammates were rebelling alana i thought you didnthave time for games sirius who died and made you ruler of the universe alana asked as lily and chloe nodded their heads in agreement alana stepped towards sirius until she was inches away from his face she saw his face visibly redden and she couldnthelp but smile i dontlike to lose and you are outnumbered 3 1 so i suggest you step aside and let the more capable sex decide what we should do alana eyes sizzled with amusement as she said this and sirius just grinned at her he threw his hands up in the air in a gesture of defeat and stepped aside the girls all high fived i knew i always liked you lily said as she linked arms with alana and they began to plan it was decided that alana would cover marlene and peter lily would take care of james and despite her protests chloe was in charge of guarding remus that left sirius open to capture the wand and bring it back to their base to the girls surprise sirius was thrilled with the plan as it gave him the chance to be the hero suddenly red sparks shot up in the air and the game was on the four teammates ran in two different directions with their wands at the ready chloe and lily took the left corridor of the 7th floor as alana and sirius took the right one is that a smile i see on your face sirius chided as he looked to his left and saw alana laughing as she ran along side of him i didntthink you were capable of anything but a glare as much as she hated to admit it she was smiling she felt as if a weight had been lifted off of her shoulders she was doing something exciting and didntfeel like she had to keep her guard up however she wasntabout to let sirius get the better of her shut up sirius stop staring at me and keep your guard up alana replied saucily as she sent a hex flying around the corner in front of them she popped her head out cautiously to see if she had hit anyone and to her displeasure she hadn t however she turned around to see sirius being approached from behind by marlene and peter expelliarmus marlene peter and alana yelled simultaneously only one wand flew across the room and it landed in alana outstretched hand with one wand she was wicked but with two wands she was unbeatable petrificus totalus alana yelled at peter and he went rigid as a board and fell over sirius took the opportunity to make his way towards the other team base dontbeat them too badly sirius yelled over his shoulder as she sprinted past the battle soon marlene and alana were face to face both in dueling position the girls knew of each other talent and were eager to test their skills marlene had seen alana in defense against the dark arts and knew that not many people could beat her alana respected marlene skills as she had seen her properly kick malfoy ass several times and was interested to find out if she had met her match you ready for this marlene as she raised her eyebrows in a taunting manner always alana replied but before she knew it she was diving out of the way of a jelly legs jinx that marlene had cleverly thrown her way however alana was quick to react as she bounced back up and yelled tarantallegra protego marlene yelled and when alana looked her spell to make marlene legs dance uncontrollably didntpenetrate the protection shield marlene then tried a tripping jinx on alana but the girl was too quick and put up her own shield both girls were laughing uncontrollably as they continued to use the most complex spells they could think of however they were quickly tiring marlene used the bat bogey hex but before she could get the incantation out alana stealthy shouted her favorite hex locomotor mortis she shouted and marlene looked as if she had been hit by an unforgivable curse as she found she could no longer move her legs her face paled as she realized she had lost and reluctantly put her wand at her side and let alana run past her great duel by the way marlene said as alana black hair disappeared around the corner you are fierce alana shouted back and marlene pumped her fist in air as that was the ultimate compliment for her on the side of the floor lily and chloe saw the red sparks fly in the air that meant alana had accomplished her mission of taking marlene and peter out of the game however they were having little luck finding james and remus i bet they are cheating and using that stupid invisibility cloak lily whispered angrily although she wasntone for rule breaking which this game definitely forced her to do she also hated losing more than anything the last thing she wanted was to give james something else to brag about so she and chloe were sitting quietly in a dark corner waiting for the boys to pass by them chloe quietly motioned for lily to listen closely and the faint sound of voice could be heard lily quickly cast a charm that allowed her wand to take her in the direction of the noise and they were on there way i knew they couldntkeep quiet james is the loudest person i know lily said triumphantly however when they came around a corner they found sirius with both james and remus wands trained on him drop it padfoot or i ll use my ever so powerful dancing hex and you dontwant to show everyone how well you can river dance do you james said mockingly however he was quiet surprised when he found that his own legs were starting to move uncontrollably he began doing pirouettes and pleas around the room and lily and chloe giggled mercilessly james potter who knew that you were such a fabulous ballet dancer you must have taken lessons lily chided as she watched her boyfriend continue his routine however james was quickly released from her spell as remus yelled rictumsempra and lily began to laugh until her sides hurt remus lupin that wasntvery gentlemanly of you chloe said saucily as she turned her wand on her ex boyfriend remus lowered his wand as he wasntin the mood to fight chloe he knew that he could easily beat her and he didntwant to raise your wand lupin or lose it chloe challenged remus looked in chloe eyes and realized she was serious so he put his wand at the ready and they approached each other for a proper duel chloe you donthave to do this you have nothing to prove remus said i not trying to prove anything remus i simply just want to beat you chloe replied as she flicked her wand sent remus flying in the opposite direction remus shocked expression was enough to make chloe want to do a victory dance but she kept her cool she prepared herself for whatever remus had up his sleeve and when he sent a jelly legs jinx in her direction she quickly deflected sent him flying backwards again fine chloe you want to play dirty then let do this remus said angrily as he pulled himself up from the ground impedimenta he yelled protego chloe shouted as she put up a protection shield soon they were hurling hexes and curses at each other dodging and diving the spells that flew around the room remus go easy on me i just a girl chloe mocked as she said the incantation for a hurling hex remus was quickly tiring but was really motivating him was his desire to test chloe she had never shown such force with her spells and something had changed in the way she dueled she seemed to be more passionate about magic petrificus totalus chloe yelled and this time her aim was impeccable remus froze and then fell to the ground with a thud chloe felt slightly bad for defeating him but that didntkeep her from smiling as she applauded herself for a job well done she had finally tapped into her talent she sent red spark flying into the air to let her teammates know that remus lupin was down meanwhile lily and james were engaged in a heated duel you gave me boils you actually gave your own girlfriend boils lily yelled out of frustration you know you are the one who has to look at me like this dontyou james laughed as his girlfriend turned bright red with anger but deep down he was slightly worried as she was even more gifted with curses when she was pissed off i mean who actually curses his own girlfriend there is something seriously wrong with you lily continued to shout as she kept her wand trained on james who was floating in the air above her lily was particularly gifted with levitating charms common lils let me down so you can properly curse me james reasoned lily liked the sound of that idea and lowered him to a foot above the ground and then dropped him ouch james yelped as he rubbed his chest however he wasntkept down for long locomotor mortis james shouted in an attempt to bind lily legs together however she quickly conjured a protective shield lily sent a tripping jinx in james way but he had extremely good reflexes from years of playing quidditch and quickly moved out of the way damn lily cursed as she prepared herself for another one of james spells did lily evans just curse hell must have frozen over or you have been spending way too much time with me james laughed as he shot another jinx at lily she became particularly livid when he shot water out from the end of his wand and drenched her from head to toe she repaid him by setting fire to his robes which forced him to roll on the ground lily those robes were brand new james whined as checked for any remaining flames that what you get for making my shirt completely see through lily said testily as she attempted to cover herself up awe that was just an accident i think you meant to actually set me on fire james said as he continued to examine his robes relax its just a little fire no one was hurt lily retorted as she used a drying charm on herself you are such a big baby am not james countered i just dontlike being set on fire by my girlfriend it doesntjust smack of love you know lily laughed as she repaired james robes with a quick wave of her wand he muttered a quick thank you under his breath lily approached him and put her arms around his neck you know i would never do anything to really harm you lily said flirtaciously as she batted her eyelashes and pouted her lips james looked down at her and kissed her gently on the lips locomotor mortis lily yelled triumphantly and james legs were bound together he fell backwards and lily stood over him with a triumphant look on her face just like i promised you are looking up at me from the flat of your back lily said with a grin that was a dirty trick distracting me with a kiss is against the rules even sirius will agree with me on that one james replied hey it not my fault if i happen to know your one weakness me lily cried with glee she began to dance around and sing a song about being the dueling master and james just laughed at her at the same time sirius could be heard yelling throughout the school that he had successfully captured the wand lily let out a cheer and james groaned as he realized he had been defeated lily let him free of her curse and when she did she gave him a kiss that made him forget that he had lost when everyone met back up by the portrait of a rather large opera singer the 7th years looked worse for the wear peter was still recovering from being petrified and had a rather large bump on the head marlene had a set of overly large teeth that alana had given her remus had a split lip and a bruised back from being thrown against walls but that wasnthalf as bad as the wounds he suffered during the full moon chloe was sporting a few boils and bruises from her duel with remus lily had bright pink hair and boils on her arms james hadntsuffered any physical injuries but had his pride wounded when he was forced to tell everyone how lily had gotten the better of him smart girl you have there prongsie sirius said as he gave lily a high five for a job well done the only two people who hadntsuffered any injuries were sirius and alana next time you are on my team marlene quipped as she gave alana a hug after everyone had said goodnight and retreated to the common room to tend to their injuries sirius and alana were left alone they stared at each other for a while but didntrealize how close they were standing to one another alana looked into sirius dark eyes and felt lost interesting friends you have there it a bit strange that you like to curse each other though alana remarked as sirius mended reached out for her arm to mend a cut she knew she should pull away but couldntbring herself to his touch relaxed her and made her forget all of her troubles suddenly she found herself inches away from his face and then without thinking she kissed him it was a tender kiss and just as good as she remembered their last one being however she quickly realized was she was doing and pulled way sirius we can t she said abruptly sirius took a step back as if he had been slapped in the face but you kissed me i thought you wanted he stammered but didntcomplete his sentence alana looked at him apologetically she had tears in her eyes and her face looked pained it complicated sirius and i just can t alana said and with that she turned and ran the other way leaving sirius standing alone and confused in the hall author note please dontbe cross with me but i have been extremely busy it been two

even longer and this way i can have two long sweet stories instead of onne condensed version i have lots of ideas brewing for the sequel so get excited for that also check out my new story something unpredictable alright its late and i ve done lots of updating today so read review you know the drill i love you all chloesc chloe quickly packed up her things and thanked professor dumbledore for his help she had been attending occlumency lessons for three weeks now and was definitely starting to improve she found that the key was compartmentalizing her emotions so they couldntbe attacked excellent work today miss stepford i believe you have made significant progress and are becoming quite skilled at blocking your thoughts dumbledore said as he read over a piece of parchment before him thank you professor i will see you again next week chloe replied as she slung her bag over her shoulder she waved goodbye and left his office feeling quite proud of herself she smiled widely as she walked down to the kitchens to meet lily and marlene for a midnight snack however unbeknownst to her four marauders watched as she left the head master quarters they were hiding under an invisibility cloak on their way back from pulling a prank on some slytherins when they happened to see chloe walk by them oye moony your girlfriend just walked by sirius said as he quickly avoided stepping on peter foot remus turned around to see chloe long hair swishing behind her and he felt a pang of sadness despite their encounter in the common room a few weeks ago their relationship seemed to be at a stand still in fact they had barely talked and he had resorted to just staring at her in class lily promised him that she was still healing and would come around when she was ready but remus was starting to doubt that on top of everything something had changed about chloe and it showed through her magic for instance last week she had blasted a slytherin into a wall for calling lily a mudblood the old chloe didnthave the killer instinct to retaliate against those who were mean to her but the new chloe wasntafraid to stand up to anyone who bullied her she isntmy girlfriend sirius remus said dejectedly sirius smiled as he slung his arm around remus shoulders she may not have the label but she still yours mate sirius said how do you figure she doesnteven talk to me remus replied as he lifted the concealment charm from himself well do you see her sniffing around any other boys no does she still love you yes so that to me says she is your girl sirius said yeah she my girlfriend as much as alana is your wife mate remus said jokingly and immediately sirius shut up sirius hadntspoke with alana since they had kissed he tried to convince himself that he was better off without her and dating a slytherin who also happened to be related to snape was more trouble than it was worth so in an attempt to forget the raven haired beauty who plagued his thoughts he was on a strict diet of snogging almost every girl he could get his hands on in fact he thought as he looked at his watch he was late for a meeting with a certain blonde haired blue eyed ravenclaw he dashed off down the corridor to the sounds of his friends heckling him dontget caught saying alana name while you are snogging someone else james shouted with that james remus and peter walked back into the empty common room and plopped down on the couch malfoy is going to have a fit when he sees what we did to his girlfriend james said with glee remus attempted to stifle a laugh as he didntwant to mock other people pain but peter giggled with excitement they had charmed narcissa robes to have writing on them that said lucius malfoy has a small wand if you know what i mean of course that had been sirius idea and he was too pleased with himself about getting back at members of his family for disowning him let just hope lily doesntfind out you had a hand in it or you are going to be in a lot of trouble remus said as he picked up a transfiguration book and started thumbing through it nah she cantget mad at me she is too in love with me to do that james said with a smile suddenly something swatted at his head and he turned around to see lily standing behind him she chloe and marlene had just returned from the kitchen and were hiding under marlene invisibility in an attempt to spy on the boys james turned bright red with embarrassment but she merely smiled too in love with you am i potter lily said with a smirk we ll see about that she walked over to peter and gave him a kiss on the lips she pulled away after a second and james began to sputter did you just did she just james asked as he looked around at his friends for an explanation lily smiled widely and peter merely sat there with a lopsided grin on his face james quickly hit him in the back of the head stop thinking about my girlfriend like that mate or else i will hex you into the next century james said then james approached lily and picked her up and threw her over his shoulder lily attempted to put up a fight but it really wasnther best effort as she was giggling uncontrollably i taking my woman and teaching her a lesson about snogging other blokes in front of me james proclaimed loudly as he slapped lily on the butt does that mean i can snog other blokes when it not in front of you lily countered as she was carried away from the group he continued to carry her through the portrait hole and out of the common room so once again everything was quiet peter yawned and then stretched his arms before he got up from the couch and made his way to bed marlene took her cue and retired to her room for the night and that left remus and chloe alone to remus surprise chloe came and sat down next to him i know i should go to bed but i too hyped up on sugar at the moment she proclaimed as she stretched out on the couch and put her feet in his lap she reached in her bag for a copy of her defense against the dark arts text book and began to read a chapter about the unforgivable curses they sat there in silence and chloe acted as if nothing had happened between them remus just eyed her with confusion but didntwant to ruin the moment they didnttalk and the time they spent together didntseem significant but it was because they were completely comfortable with one another there were no secrets tearing them apart they were simply just being themselves after a while chloe yawned and stretched her arms in a sign of fatigue she lifted her tired body up from the couch and placed her book back in her bag remus looked up at her and quietly wished her goodnight chloe walked over to remus and looked into his eyes thanks for waiting for me remus chloe said quietly as she bent down and kissed him lightly on the cheek with that she walked upstairs and went to bed the next day the seventh year gryffindors sat in defense against the dark arts class taking notes on how to fight off inferius the professor was droning on about fire spells and curses to repel the gruesome creatures the students secretly hoped that they would never need to use this information as fighting a dead body didntsound very appealing thankfully the lecture ended although thoughts of lunch didntplague the class as they had lost their appetites today we are going to start the dueling portion of the class and the competition will continue for the rest of the year with the winner receiving a deluxe edition of the dark forces a guide to self protection signed by the author himself professor hardwick said the seventh year gryffindors and slytherins glared at each other in anticipation of the coming battles bellatrix black had a particularly nasty look on her face however i want clean battles and if anyone steps a toe out of line he or she will receive an extremely harsh punishment hardwick warned alright first to duel will be potter and crabbe james got up lazily from his chair and lumbered to the front of the classroom where he prepared to show off his skills to say that he was mildly confident that he would win was an understatement crabbe tried not to show his fear as he put his wand in the ready position james did the same and they waited for hardwick mark duel hardwick shouted crabbe shot a leg locking curse at james which he easily deflected james retaliated quickly not wanting to waste any time petrificus totalus he shouted and crabbe fell to the ground with a thud hardwick declared james the winner and quickly un petrified crabbe james went back to his seat and received pats on the shoulders from his mates for a job well done sirius battled rodolphus lestrange and won with a cleverly placed jelly legs jinx that kept lestrange from standing up right the gryffindors tried hard to conceal their delight when remus beat snape by using a stunning spell but james still let out a whoop of excitement and sirius bowed down to remus as if he were a god the next match up will be alana snape and lily evans hardwick announced lily and alana looked at each other and smiled lily had heard from marlene that alana was quite skilled with her wand and sirius had suffered a lot of embarrassment at her hands so she wasntexactly looking forward to this lily summoned her courage and put her wand at the ready duel hardwick yelled stupefy lily yelled with force protego alana shouted and a beautifully formed shield appeared and lily stunning spell bounced right off of it petrificus totalus alana shouted in retaliation but lily was too quick as she ducked and then threw another curse at alana alana dove on the ground but not before she shot a leg locker curse at lily protego lily shouted and her shield appeared and deflected the spell impedimenta lily shouted loudly and this time her aim was impeccable alana had a look of shock on her face as she was blown backwards off of her feet luckily hardwick had charmed the walls to feel like cushions but the battle was over lily was declared the victor much to alana chagrin lily went back to her seat with a smile on her face she was still undefeated she thought to herself my girlfriend kicked your girlfriend ass james chided sirius sirius glared at james for the comment she not my girlfriend sirius growled james dropped it and turned his head to watch the next pair duel however he only had to look at remus face to figure out who the pair was bellatrix black and chloe stepford bellatrix looked as if christmas had come early her dark face was twisted into a demented grin as she approached the front of the class however the look on chloe face was much more fascinating as she showed no fear remus just prayed that chloe wouldntget hurt duel hardwick yelled but before he could get the words out bellatrix shot a spell straight at chloe protego chloe yelled and a beautiful shield appeared the gryffindors stared at each other as in class chloe had always had trouble with defense spells stupefy chloe retaliated but with a flick of her wand bellatrix deflected the spell impedimenta bellatrix yelled and chloe was forced to dive on the floor locomotor mortis chloe yelled back and now bellatrix was on the ground you ll pay for that bellatrix yelled incarcerous bellatrix yelled as ropes flew out of her wand chloe found herself being bound by magical ropes but her work with professor dumbledore had helped her wandless magic and she muttered a quick counter curse and the ropes slipped off of her is that all you have the big bad bellatrix versus small innocent chloe and you cantdo better than ropes chloe taunted chloe dontencourage her remus shouted but chloe didnthear his cries petrificus totalus bellatrix yelled in rage but chloe used a shield charm again bellatrix was becoming incensed she hadntcounted on a fight impedimenta bellatrix tried again but chloe dodged the spell aguamenti chloe shouted as she squirted bellatrix with water from the end of her wand bellatrix gasped with shock and then her face twisted into a malicious grin sectum bellatrix yelled but she was too late langlock chloe shouted and bellatrix tongue was glued to the top of her mouth prohibiting her to spout any other incantations bellatrix jumped in down with rage but hardwick announced chloe was the winner miss stepford that was particularly clever hardwick complimented chloe on her ingenious plan chloe took a seat and her fellow gryffindors roared with applause remus leaned over and whispered in her ear i knew you could do it he said quietly and chloe felt chills run down her spine chloe felt strong for the first time in a long time facing bellatrix was a daunting task and to know that she could stand her ground and get the better of the young death eater in training was empowering lily threw her arms around her best friend and hugged her with pride that was brilliant chloe you are the bravest person i know lily said encouragingly chloe just smiled as hardwick awarded gryffindor 20 points for chloe clever stunt it was late and night and the only people awake were james and lily they were lounging on the couches in the gryffindor common room finishing up their essays for transfiguration when they dotted the last i and crossed the last t s lily moved over to where james was sitting she sat down on his lap and put her head on his chest as she curled up james absently stroked her hair as they stared into the fire i cantbelieve the year has gone by so fast in a month or so we will be graduating james said as he kissed lily on top of the head i know and then we have to face the real world lily replied neither one wanted to think about the dangers that would face them once they were outside of hogwarts and no longer protected by its walls they just wanted to enjoy the moment what do you think will happen to us after we graduate lily asked suddenly it had been a question that had been plaguing her thoughts for a while now she knew she loved james but she didntknow what the next step was she didntwant to lose him and she was afraid without the daily proximity that hogwarts provided them they would grow apart they were young and although lily wanted to believe their relationship would last they had a lot to deal with first well i think we will probably get jobs hopefully as aurors and we will work for the order and in our spare time spend time with our friends james replied lamely not understanding lily question no i mean what will happen to us will we stay together lily asked james looked at her and smiled well that up to you lils because i dontreally plan on going anywhere so as long as you are game so am i james said with a grin lily jumped up and pounced him for giving such a flippant answer to a serious question but she knew that he was right they were meant for each other she loved him with all of her heart they kissed passionately and when they were done they lay in each others arms what do you see in our future lily said as she played with james hair james grinned as he pulled lily closer to him well we will be wildly successful aurors that i have no doubt of someday in the future i ll ask you to marry me and hopefully you ll say yes then we ll get married and sirius will be the best man and give a loud and somewhat inappropriate toast we will buy a little house and live quite happily when we re ready and the world is less dangerous i figure we will have kids they will all have your eyes and hopefully they wontinherit my bad eyesight sirius will be the godfather but dontworry because he will be a lot more mature by then hopefully james said as he painted a picture of what he wanted to have with lily lily sighed contently at the image james put in her head she also laughed as she remembered what sirius had said to her the night she and james had gotten together about being the godfather of her children she wanted everything james had described and more as long as we are together that is all that matters to me lily said sleepily well that is a given love voldemort himself couldntkeep me from you james said as he let out a yawn lily kissed him on the lips and felt the familiar tingle in her body that only james gave her she hugged him tightly as she buried her head in his chest and closed her eyes this was what she wanted for the rest of her life when she opened her eyes again james was fast asleep she smiled to herself and curled up to falls asleep while the wizarding world was in chaos lily felt secure knowing that james would always be there for her he was the one james stepped off the train just in time to see lily leaving with her parents his heart sank as he realized how much he had messed up with her he would be lucky if she ever talked to him again james heard his mother shouts as she made her way through the crowd she threw her arms around her son and gave him a big hug james i have missed you so much his mother said sirius made his way over to james and his mother sirius stayed with james and his parents during the holidays since he had runaway from his family the blacks were notorious for their pureblood mentalities and their love of the dark arts sirius on the other hand couldntstand discrimination and the rigidness of his parents household so last summer he had runaway to live with james well here is my other son mrs potter said as she gave sirius a hug mr potter came over to his wife and son and smiled have a good year son mr potter asked yes sir we won the quidditch cup and the house cup as well this year james said trying to sound impressive well that is brilliant and what about you sirius didntcause too much trouble i hope oh you know me mr potter i try my best to give the slytherins hell sirius said with a smirk james dad let out a laugh and slapped sirius on the shoulder sirius and james said goodbye to peter and remus and promised to have them over for some quidditch soon oh good news boys i managed to snag some tickets to the world cup mr potter said impressively wow dad that is great how did you manage that james asked hardly containing his excitement well being an auror and fighting against voldemort does have its benefits mr potter chuckled james looked at his father with worry in his eyes his mother saw her son expression and put her arm on his shoulder she shared his concern for her husband safety now harold stop bragging if the boys want to learn about your exploits they can read the daily prophet mrs potter said with a little laugh harold potter active battle against voldemort and his death eaters had become famous he had single handedly put many dark wizards into azkaban and had foiled my of lord voldemort plans mr potter gave the infamous potter grin and started to lead the group out of the station and to the ministry car that had been provided the rest of the journey to the potter manor was uneventful as mr potter listened to the exploits of the marauders and reminisced about his days at hogwarts the boys told a particularly eventful story that involved getting the slytherins to roar like lions every time they passed a gryffindor it sounds like either dumbledore loves you or he has gone soft because the four of you should have been expelled by now mr potter managed to spit out between fits of laughter the car finally pulled up the large manor and mr and mrs potter as well as james and sirius popped of the car and walked up the long drive way sirius and james started to run as fast as they could towards the house come on padfoot keep up you can run faster than that james shouted oye prongs slow down i not on the quidditch team you know sirius yelled back panting and out of breath they reached the front door and ran straight for the kitchen sirius conjured up butterbeers while james found his mother cookies they were sitting there happily when they heard screams and a loud bang james and sirius sprinted towards the screams with their wands at the ready they ran outside in time to see james mother being hit with the killing curse james growled low in his throat and started to advance on the cloaked figure he saw sirius join him at his side the two approached the cloaked figure with their wands out james felt the hot tears build in his eyes he saw his father lifeless body on the ground next to his mother s james could barely think straight as he pointed his wand at the figure expelliarmus sirius shouted as he pointed his wand at the figure james sent the blasting curse in the direction of the dark wizard however their efforts were fruitless silly children your spells are worthless on me the cloaked figure croaked die james yelled as he lunged towards the wizard if he couldntbeat him with curses he would physically take him down with one flick of the wand james was hit with the crucio curse and he screamed in agony voldemort turned on sirius and smiled evilly you know black you would do well to fall into line with me defying me means certain death voldemort cackled never sirius shouted as he attempted to shoot a curse fool aligning yourself with the potters you should choose your friends more carefully voldemort hissed as he hit sirius with the crucio curse voldemort turned on james ready to kill him he pointed his wand and started the incantation when the potter estate started to swarm with aurors voldemort realized he was outnumbered and the potter boy was not worth it he quickly escaped james and sirius were sent straight to st mungo for medical treatment their lifeless bodies lay in the hospital for three days on the third day james decided it was time to open his eyes he immediately felt pain rush to his head and as he recounted the events he began to cry james potter had never cried but the image of his mother being killed by that thing was too much for him to handle it had been her screams he heard he wiped the tears from his face and turned over to see sirius lying next to him sirius showed no signs of movement and james began to panic sirius mate wake up i need you padfoot you are my only family left wake up sirius james cried as he began to shake sirius body oye prongs you act like i dead or something sirius said as he opened his eyes ease up on the shaking will you james looked at sirius and embraced him in a brotherly hug sirius looked at his friend and smiled he knew that james would need him in the weeks to come you scared me mate james said as he gave a weak smile the boys were interrupted when the door opened and a flash of purple robes descended upon them dumbledore peered over the top of his spectacles and gave a wide smile at the men before him james i am very sorry for your loss if there is anything i can do or if you need someone to talk to i am always available to my students and my friends dumbledore said in a somber tone thank you professor i appreciate your sympathies i just have one question though james said what is that james dumbledore asked what can i do to help bring the downfall of this monster james said defiantly i appreciate your bravery james but the best thing you can do is come back to school and study for your n e so you can go into the world as best prepared as possible dumbledore said kindly that is not enough professor lord voldemort killed my parents james said hoarsely james your time will come but for now you need to stay safe and not chase after lord voldemort dumbledore said firmly james face turned red and he felt the need to hit something sirius saw his friend face and frowned mr black i understand that you no longer reside with your parents so i have arranged for both of you to stay with mr lupin for the remainder of the summer i can only advise that both of you use extreme caution and if for any reason you need me i will be there dumbledore said as if he knew something they didn t dumbledore exited the room as quickly as he had entered it leaving james and sirius to ponder what had just happened they sat there in silence taking in all of the events of the past couple of days james tried hard to fight back the tears that were filling his eyes first he grew angry with his father for putting his family in danger he couldntunderstand how someone could be so selfish that he would knowingly endanger the ones he loved but then he realized that his father did what he thought was the right thing to do however taking the correct path was not always easy james train of thought was interrupted when sirius started to cough i wonder why voldemort didntjust kill us he kept stalling sirius said as though he was talking more to himself than to james james cleared his throat and wiped the tears from his eyes he turned around to face sirius with a look of pain i have no idea sirius but one thing is for sure he will try again james said hoarsely the boys were interrupted when remus and his parents entered the room remus saw his two best friends and went over to embrace them in a brotherly hug the three boys hugged and tried to take in their changed realities when the boys broke apart mr and mrs lupin extended their condolences to james for his loss james put on a brave face and thanked them for their sympathies and hospitalities with that sirius and james left st mungo without any family but each other and headed to the lupins home it would be a summer that would change them all forever and force them to grow up author note hey kids here is another instalment of my story i know it kind of long but i wanted to capture the mood of the situation hope you think this chapter is rather amusing next chapter will be a tad bit darker i think i have close to 6 or 7 more chapters of the story and then it will be done but have no fear because a sequel is in the works i am busy pre writing as we speak some great stuff i promise so read and review and tell me what you think love you all lily will you please hurry up or we are going to be late james said as he tapped his foot irritably and checked his watch for the time lily frantically threw clothes in her bag as she did a last minute check that she had everything she was going to need for the weekend she was dressed in muggle clothes so as not to set her sister off petunia would throw a fit if lily showed up to the rehearsal dinner in her robes suddenly fear struck her in the heart james you are wearing muggle clothes arentyou lily yelled back with panic in her voice james hadntspent much time in the muggle world his abysmal grades in muggle studies and his subsequent dropping of the class after the owls were indicative of his lack of knowledge about the world lily came from you mean i cantjust wear my dress robes james asked cheekily as he continued to look at his watch after hearing this lily flew out of her room and down the stairs to check that james was dressed properly i knew that would get you out of that bloody room james said as he took lily bag and shrunk it down so it could fit in his pocket lily just shook her head no magic this weekend remember that james potter lily said as she took her bag back and turned it back into its normal size you muggles are always doing things the hard way james said as he kissed lily on the lips to her amazement james was dressed in a pair of jeans and a button down navy blue shirt and he looked quite the muggle she just hoped that nothing terrible would happen while they were at her parents house well dontjust stand there let get moving or we wonthave much time to get ready before the rehearsal dinner lily said as she started to walk towards the portrait hole james just rolled his eyes as he had been saying the exact same thing for the past twenty minutes to say he wasnttoo excited about meeting lily horrid older sister was putting it mildly his main concern was just trying not to screw up he knew this weekend was extremely important to lily and he was going to do his best to not embarrass her for the past two weeks remus had been giving him a crash course in muggle studies so at least james knew what a dish washer was although it did sound rather complicated to him they arrived at professor dumbledore office and he quickly ushered the couple to his fire place where they would floo to a house close to lily and from there they would walk while it seemed ridiculous to not floo directly to lily house she didntwant to take any chances and upset her sister so close to her wedding day please take care miss evans and mr potter trouble seems to come looking for the both of you dumbledore said with a smirk as lily stepped into the fire place and yelled her destination james quickly followed and they both landed in a rather cramped living room that smelled of sour milk they brushed the soot off and tried to find their way out of the dark house lily evans and james potter i presume a cracked voice said as they started to leave the room james and lily turned around and face a middle aged woman with a severe looking face she eyed the couple closely as she stroked the cat that was in her arms um thank you for allowing us to use your fire place lily said as she stretched out her hand in gratitude you are quite welcome miss evans i am arabella figg the older woman said as she set the cat down to shake lily hand i would have never taken you for a witch mrs figg lily said in an astonished tone arabella figg had been the evans neighbor for as long as lily could remember and the woman never showed any signs of magic lily always thought she was just an old spinster she didntthink that surrey attracted many people from her world the muggles where lily lived were extremely mugglish i am not a witch i am a squib mrs figg replied matter of factly and do be careful i can hear your sister screams of frustration all the way over here she seems to be in quite a state lily and james quickly thanked mrs figg for her kindness and proceeded to walk next door to number 4 privet drive it was an ordinary looking house with a simple two story lay out it didnttake up much space as the evans family never wanted to intrude on anyone however the noise that was coming from inside was not normal there was a high pitched scream fearing the worst lily and james dropped their suitcases and grabbed their wands from their pockets alohamora lily shouted and they were granted access into the normally locked house they sprinted to the kitchen as it seemed to be the place where the sound was coming from lily heart pounded out of her chest as she silently prayed that this was some sort of cruel joke they burst through the kitchen doors with their wands at the ready but to their relief only saw an extremely red faced petunia evans screaming at her mother this is all your fault mother i cantbelieve you let this happen vernon family is allergic to vegetables and now we are serving vegetable soup petunia wailed rose evans just looked at her daughter and tried her best to be sympathetic however the argument was interrupted when her youngest daughter and a tall messy haired boy with glasses came running in through the door petunia and mrs evans took one look at lily and james yet both had strikingly different reactions what on earth is going on in here i thought someone was being murdered lily said with panic still hanging in her voice mrs evans launched herself at her daughter and the two flung their arms around each other lily i missed you her mother said as she kissed lily on her face meanwhile petunia stared at james with disgust etched in her face then she let out another high pitched scream what is she doing here and why on earth did you let her bring another freak into this house petunia shouted quite shrilly james was quite taken aback by the somewhat horsey looking young woman who was producing such a wretched sound oi petti shut it or i will turn your wedding cake into a pile of frogs lily said testily petunia looked outraged but her fear took over and she immediately backed down lily took a step towards james and held his hand tightly mum petunia i want you to meet my boyfriend james potter lily said as if she had rehearsed the scene before her a thousand times mrs evans immediately embraced james and offered him a seat at the kitchen table it is so wonderful to finally meet you james i ve heard quite a bit about you over the years mrs evans said with a wink james gave his best lopsided grin and tousled his hair nervously nothing too horrid i hope james replied mrs evans laughed as she brought over a pot of tea and a plate of crumpets i sure lily was mostly exaggerating but i will say that i admire your work i heard about the time you disrupted exams when you released oh what do you call those things again lily sniffers niffers oh that right nifflers all over the school mrs evans said as she poured a spot of tea for james james turned red with embarrassment he was going to have to get sirius back for that brilliant idea when he returned to school yes well my friends and i were just trying to lighten the mood people do better on exams when they arentas stressed james attempted to explain lily watched on in amusement as mrs evans and james talked james you had me at hello i ve always been a sucker for the bad boy i glad to know my daughter is dating someone with as much spirit as she has mrs evans said she was then reminded of the boring and insufferable git that petunia was marrying she didntunderstand how her daughters could be so different her two daughters were staring daggers at each other and looked as if they were ready to pounce did you have to bring another freak like you petunia said accusingly be careful who you call a freak petti lily retaliated both james and mrs evans attempted to stay out of the argument as they didntwant to be on the receiving end of either of the girls tempers it is bad enough that you have to be the way you are but is it necessary to parade around with another miscreant why cantyou just be normal petunia continued coldly lily felt for her wand in her pocket and she wanted desperately to fling a hex at petunia but her conscience got the better of her i sorry you feel that way lily said attempting to be the bigger person and i sorry you thought you think i want you here at my wedding mum forced me to send you an invitation but if it were up to me i wouldnthave someone like you ruining my wedding petunia said as the anger rose in her voice well i guess i sorry that you have no friends to be your bridesmaids so you are stuck with your freakish sister and her freakish boyfriend i suggest you build a bridge and get over it lily replied quite horrified at the way her sister was acting she felt hurt and angry at the same time she wanted nothing more but for them to get along it pained her that some people had such ugly attitudes about anything that was different from them freak petunia yelled and she stomped out of the room however as she left a slight monkey tail could be seen forming on her behind lily stared at james but instead of yelling at him she gave him an appreciative smile well let get you settled in so you can wash up and get ready for the rehearsal dinner mrs evans said as she tried to brush over the exchange that had just taken place where is dad mum lily asked as and james hauled their suitcases upstairs he is picking up some of the dursleys at the airport and taking them to their hotel poor fellow it seems that the whole lot is quite large so he is forced to take several trips as he cantfit all of them in the car mrs evans giggled he should be back before dinner though she wasntone to make fun of anybody but the dursleys were quite unpleasant and brutish but that was what her daughter wanted and as long as petunia was happy she would be happy for her james was told to put his luggage in the guest room and lily left to go put her things in her own room he looked around the room and saw small pictures scattered about however they were different from what he was used to they werentmoving there were a few shots of lily as a little girl she looked so cute james thought to himself he tested out the bed and quickly mirrored sirius to do an impression of lily sister when he was done he decided to walk down the hall and bug lily so this is your bedroom eh james said as he entered lily room it funny i always thought your room would be covered with books and such things but it really quite girly evans oh shut it you i happen to like the color pink lily said defensively james plopped down on the bed and stared up at the ceiling ever had a boy up here before he asked casually lily turned around from unpacking to look at james with a devilish grin loads of times two at once actually those were some good times lily said reminiscently james choked a little and sat up he couldntmuch stand the idea of his lily with another bloke are you serious james asked with a rather sick look on his face lily threw a pillow at james and then laughed of course not i not some scarlet woman i am innocent and pure lily said as she used her wand to make a mock hallow form around her head james tackled her and threw her on the bed it wasntlong before they were engaging in a full blown snogging session you my love are a lot of things but you ve spent far too much time with me to be either innocent or pure james said with a grin lily pretended to be offended but there were worse things to be accused of with the end of their snogging session they broke apart and james headed back to his room to get ready for the rehearsal dinner he was going to need some time to figure out how to tie a tie around six o clock james still hadntcome out of his room so lily went downstairs to see if there was anything she could do to help she went into the kitchen and she found her father hiding out at the table doing a crossword puzzle she immediately went over to him and gave him a gigantic hug hello pumpkin it been far too long since your last visit joe evans said as he let his daughter go from his grasp lily took a seat next to her father and began looking at the crossword puzzle he was working on hiding out from the dursleys lily asked as she scribbled in an answer for 22 across mr evans smiled and simply nodded his head all that is important lily flower is that your sister is happy mr evans said even if that means we are forced to be in laws with a giant pack of hippos lily let out a snort of laughter she continued to talk with her father about school and everything she had done over the past year i should like to meet this sirius black sometime he sounds like quite a character mr evans said after lily told him about the time sirius had charmed all of the transfiguration text books to spray water at the students hey sirius may have come up with the idea but i found the right charm to use james said as he entered the kitchen wearing a black suit with a blue collared shirt underneath both mr evans and lily laughed james potter i presume mr evans said as he got up to shake the hand of the young man standing before him guilty as charged james replied as he took a seat next to lily it is nice to meet you sir it nice to finally meet you in person after all of the things we have heard from lily about you over the years mr evans said as he sized up james she has been smitten with you for years now james smiled an impish grin and let his natural charisma take over lily blushed furiously at this comment and slapped her father on the shoulder for his lack of confidentiality dad lily said irritatedly please dontmake his ego any larger than it needs to be james lily and mr evans all laughed and then james and mr evans entered into an intense discussion about quidditch mr evans had been interested in the sport since lily had told him about it back in her first year at school but he wanted to know more when lily told him james was the captain of the school team mr evans took the opportunity to find out more about the fascinating game but how do you not get knocked off your broom by those bludger things and it sounds quite dangerous to me mr evans said as james explained the roles of each player on the team it is dangerous but if you are good enough you can avoid getting hurt too badly james said and then went on to explain such complicated moves as the wronski feint however mrs evans interrupted the conversation when she announced it was time to head to the rehearsal hall for dinner she was followed closely by petunia who was wearing a taffeta yellow dress with puff sleeves lily resisted the urge to giggle lily herself was dressed in a simple halter black dress with a low back she had her hair down and curled so she looked quite beautiful james got up to follow mrs evans and petunia to the car although petunia watched him with a wary eye worried that he would turn her into a farm animal at any time lily got up to leave as well but her father held her back no tricks lils her dad said warningly lily was reminded about the time she had floated a bowl of hot soup over vernon dursley head and then accidentally lost her concentration and it dropped on top of him she laughed quietly at her own brilliance dontworry dad james and i will be on our best behavior she said with an innocent smile her father patted her on the head with approval and the two walked out to the car i like james he is quite hilarious and a little naughty which reminds me of myself in my younger days mr evans said as he reflected on his daughter choice for a boyfriend well i glad you like him because i was thinking about keeping him around for a while lily responded before she crawled into the back seat of her parents car james lily and petunia sat awkwardly in the backseat and didntsay a word to each other as petunia threw glares in the couple direction did you have to wear such a revealing dress petunia growled did you have to wear a dress that makes you look like a glass of lemonade lily countered girls stop it mr evans intervened they arrived at the hall and all five piled out of the car petunia walked briskly ahead to find her fianc your sister is a real gem james whispered into lily ear as they walked up to the entrance lily laughed darkly she was just glad to have james with her to keep her company they went in and quickly greeted the dursley clan james was particularly amused when he met vernon sister marge who looked like her brother in drag she eyed the couple suspiciously but didntextend her hand in greeting off at the reformatory school are you lily and i suppose he is a delinquent like you marge said pointing her sausage like finger at james it doesntlook like they have beaten the rebellion out of you yet i ll make sure petunia writes a note of concern to st brutus s yes they must use the cane on us more often obviously we arentcured yet so you better keep your distance lily said as she and james turned to find another person to talk to these people are horrible i think that man woman over there could give snivellus a run for his money in the most horrible human on earth contest james said as he and lily went to find a table to sit at both decided they were going to need a drink if they were going to survive the night they went to the bar and quickly purchased two strong gin and tonics james was thoroughly enjoying the muggle drink they were standing in a corner hoping not to be noticed when someone found them you are going to need something stronger then a g and t if you are going to survive this night that woman over there keeps looking at me as if she wants to snack on my leg as an appetizer a young woman with reddish hair said lily immediately hugged her young aunt and was glad to see a familiar face aunt caroline had always been lily favorite relative she was her mother sister and lily liked to think that they were quite similar caroline was adventurous outgoing and spirited and who is this handsome young man caroline said as she stretched out her elegant hand to shake james aunt caro this is my boyfriend james lily introduced the two james grinned and instantly liked lily aunt the three stood talking for a while trying to hide the pack of dursleys who were marauding around looking for the buffet table how is school going lily please tell me you have a plot to liven up this wedding can you turn vernon into the toad he really is caroline joked caroline was the only family member besides her immediate family that knew about lily being a witch she was thoroughly fascinated by lily abilities and was always encouraging lily to use them to cause a raucous oh you ll have to wait and see i sure james and i will come up with something to make things interesting he isnthogwarts biggest trouble maker for nothing lily beamed for once glad that james had a pension for mischief i thought i wasntallowed to use magic james asked curiously he had been holding back for a while now because he didntwant to upset lily but if she was giving him the go ahead he had a few ideas about how to humble petunia and her horrible fianc vernon well that was before i remember by sister is a brat and she is marrying into a family full of brutish ignoramuses lily replied stingingly if you say so then operation defeat the dursleys is underway james said excellent aunt caroline chimed in at first no one seemed to notice the oddities that were occurring people seemed to be spilling their drinks on their clothes or mysteriously dropping their plates of food marge dursley managed to trip over her large feet and fall flat on her face lily giggled when she saw that she also noticed that james had sent a tripping jinx in her direction petunia didntseem to notice the accidents that were occurring and walked around with her head held up high and her nose in the air vernon accompanied her and the couple was the perfect vision of boring lily thought to herself promise me that we will never be boring lily said to james as she watched the party that was ensuing around them james who had his arm around draped around lily turned to look at her in the eyes he grinned at her devilishly stick with me and i promise you ll never be bored james said as he levitated a platter of meat into the air and then dropped it on the ground it splattered everywhere and lily saw petunia shoot her a look of hatred lily just shrugged her shoulders and played innocent i glad i dating the master of mayhem lily said as she kissed james on lips james laughed and took a little bow at your service james said soon it was time to eat and lily was forced to sit up at the head table as she was petunia maid of honor james was left to sit with aunt caroline and lily found herself wishing she was there with them she watched in disgust as vernon dursley kissed his fianc and then the best man began to clink his glass in order to begin the festivities however he was slightly intoxicated and began to sway from side to side congratu hic lations old boy i knew you d find someone someday even when you hic doubted yourself hic i knew you d do it she may not be hic pretty but she ll do the best man said drunkenly occasionally slurring his words mr evans went and grabbed the portly young man off the stage while everyone giggled lily looked over at james and caroline who were in fits of laughter however she realized that it was her turn to speak when her sister kicked her ankle under the table lily stood up and smiled graciously she looked out into the crowd and saw james giving her the thumbs up congratulations petunia you got what you always wanted and i hope you have the ordinary dull life that you have been dreaming about since we were little girls lily said as she raised her glass to toast her sister after the speech lily sat back down and suddenly someone grabbed her arm petunia asked you not to make a scene are you too dumb to comprehend what that means vernon dursley asked viciously lily tried to pry herself from her future brother in law grip but vernon wasntletting go let go you are hurting me lily pleaded but vernon clamped down tighter james looked up from his food to see the scene unfold between lily and vernon his girlfriend looked visibly upset hatred for vernon dursley boiled inside of him he and petunia were just like the death eaters who thought they were better than muggleborns and half bloods maybe they didntkill people but they had the same ignorant attitudes so james did something that neither he nor lily would ever forget just stay out of my but vernon couldntcomplete the sentence because he spat up a disgusting looking slug vernon quickly removed his hands from lily wrists and covered his mouth however that didntprevent another slug from coming up lily looked at an extremely shocked vernon and tried extremely hard not to laugh you did this to me you freak make it go away vernon screamed as he croaked up another frog by this time petunia had wised up to the problems her soon to be husband was suffering from and began to wail mr and mrs evans rushed over to their daughters as they heard petunia yells marge dursley also made her way to the front of the room to see what all of the commotion was about what did you do to my fianc petunia said accusingly as she pointed her boney finger at her sister lily was just as shocked and didntknow what to say obviously you are an incurable case i say you should have been drowned at the beginning marge dursley said as she helped petunia escort vernon out of the rehearsal hall mrs evans ran after the trio ready to console petunia who would undoubtedly be traumatized james figured that vernon had suffered enough humiliation and quickly muttered under his breath finite incantatem mr evans looked at lily and as hard as he tried he couldntkeep a smile from forming on his face i told you no tricks mr evans attempted to admonish his daughter lily hung her head in mock shame and muttered a quick apology although i daresay the walrus had it coming to him mr evans said cheekily he excused his daughter and she went to find james who was sitting quietly at the table he had been assigned to lily evans you really need to learn to control your magic james whispered into lily ear as she took a seat next to him yes well i guess i just let it slip lily played along although she knew what james had done for her james stood up from the table and motioned for lily hand care to dance james asked smoothly lily stood up and took his hand and they walked out onto the dance floor in preparation for the song to start the music started and james led lily around the dance floor with the grace and ease that comes from years of going to potter family balls they talked and laughed as if no one else was in the room i ll let the tricks slide tonight but at our rehearsal dinner you better not pull anything lily said as she spun around the dance floor james looked down at her and laughed planning our wedding and i haventeven proposed yet admit it evans you like me james said arrogantly lily pushed in the shoulder for the arrogant comment but couldnthelp but smile well maybe i like you just a little bit i still think you have confunded me lily replied playfully nah you are just attracted to my dashing good looks and sparkling personality james said cheekily yes that must be it lily said sarcastically author note i sorry it has been so long i am going to try and finish up this story asap and i have a sequel in the works keep the faith and read and review lily poked her head around the corner of the hallway and prayed that no one was there when she saw that the coast was clear she made her way carefully to the bathroom however her efforts to go undetected were soon thwarted donttake this the wrong way lils but you look like a large piece of cotton candy james said with a wicked smirk on his face he didntduck fast enough and was hit squarely in the forehead with a pink satin slipper damn you james potter dontmake this worse than it already is lily said testily as she threatened him with another shoe ouch lily that really hurt james said as he rubbed his forehead vigorously lily looked at herself in the hallway mirror and groaned truth be told she did look like cotton candy the giant bubble gum pink taffeta dress was quite possibly the most horrendous thing she had ever seen the puffy sleeves kept falling down and the lace petty coat itched so terribly that she had been forced to perform an anti itching charm but the most offending piece of the outfit was the large hat she was forced to wear that kept her from seeing anything in the distance i look absolutely appalling lily said as she looked at herself james came up behind her and put his arms around her waste i think you look quite smashing for someone who quite possibly could star in the movie version of mother goose nursery rhymes james said he applauded himself for that clever comment you wouldntbe in such a good mood if you had to wear this abomination lily said as she looked at james and straightened his tie he looked quite dashing in his muggle tuxedo which made lily all the more bitter that she was forced to look like bubble gum after cursing the outfit a few more times and threatening to place a silencing charm on james if he made one more comment about it lily descended the stairs and met the rest of her family she could see her mother and father struggling to contain their laughter and she sent them a glare that dared them to say something petunia was already pacing in the foyer about bloody time you and your sodding boyfriend got down here petunia said angrily sorry petunia i was having a hard time convincing myself to come downstairs in this rag lily spat back petunia advanced upon her sister with murder in her eyes but luckily her father intervened now girls lets be civil this is supposed to be the happiest day of petunia life her father said diplomatically his words seemed to have their intended effect and petunia simply walked out of the house and marched towards the car when they got to the church lily was forced to separate from james and go with the rest of the bridal party in the back of the church she learned who she was walking down the isle with and that was when she almost lost her breakfast vernon dursley best man was a large elephant of a man with squinty eyes and a mouth full of crooked teeth he seemed very pleased that he would be escorting lily lily on the other hand was horrified by his severe case of bad breath so when she was forced to take his extended arm she held her breath for as long as possible the wedding went smoothly and soon petunia evans was petunia dursley and she seemed extremely pleased with herself at the reception she went around to all of her friends and bragged about being a married woman she admonished her single friends and promised to set them up with vernon friends luckily lily was allowed to sit with james at the reception and so she removed from her sister gloating god forbid they have children james said as he shivered at the thought oh i can assure you petunia will make me an aunt before long lily replied they continued to eat the wedding cake and tried not to make eye contact with anyone so as not to be disturbed however their privacy as interrupted when lily mother told her it was time to catch the bouquet lily protest vehemently but her mother won out she got up and left the table but not before james told her that if she didntcatch the bouquet she wasntwelcome back evidently he and aunt caroline had a wager about who was coming away with the flowers my money is on the large woman who could be a midfielder for manchester united caroline said referring to marge dursley lily walked towards the gathering of single women with apprehension she had no desire to be trampled by these people petunia got up on stage and turned around with her eyes closed she released the bouquet and the women went flying determined not to be out down by a dursley lily jumped in the fray herself she didntmind if her dress got torn up a bit she threw a few elbows and used some well placed tripping jinxes when all was said and done she stood victorious with a bouquet of pink carnations in her hand leave it to petunia to pick the cheapest of flowers lily thought to herself she walked over to james with a large grin on her face i dare say you cheated lily evans james said with a smirk as he gave her a gigantic hug well it made for a fairer match i mean did you see the size of some of those bruisers up there lily said with a laugh pay up caroline i told you lily could do it james said with glee caroline grudgingly opened her purse and cursed herself for not stipulating that lily couldntuse magic the three managed to amuse themselves and avoid talking to any unpleasant people for as long as possible however when the music started james offered lily his hand they walked towards the dance floor and began gliding elegantly across it they stared into each others eyes and smiled who knew a rakehell like you could dance so well lily remarked as she attempted to keep up with james bloody potter family balls james said after the dance lily and james went inside to get a glass of punch they were pouring their classes when lily dropped hers something is wrong lily said as she grabbed her wand james looked at her and immediately pulled his wand from his pocket as he saw the look on lily face lily began to run towards the door that led to the outdoor reception however when she looked outside she immediately ducked and pulled james down with her come out little ones your parents want to say something to you said a cold dark voice that sent shivers down lily spine lily peeked around the corner of the door and saw her parents being held at wand point by death eaters as lord voldemort stood in the center of the dance floor wasting no time lily stood up with her wand at her side and was ready to go outside but james pulled her back lily wait he said with urgency in his voice he pulled her down to keep her out of harm way and placed a hand over her mouth so she wouldntprotest dontbe stupid james said he wants you to use your anger so you arentthinking he let his hand off of lily mouth and she looked at him with fear and urgency we have to do something or he will kill them lily whispered barely able to contain the sobs that were building in her throat james thought quickly he pulled the magic mirror he used to communicate with sirius from his pocket he pointed his wand at it and immediately sirius face appeared death eaters and voldemort at lily house tell dumbledore and get everyone to come as fast as you can james said i grow tired of waiting or is there no gryffindor bravery in you at all voldemort continued to taunt lily looked at her parents and saw how frightened they were she saw her sister who was screaming hysterically as a wand was pointed at her head run lily she heard her father yelling but lily wasntabout to run she knew exactly what she had to do he showing restraint by not killing the muggles he wants us james said darkly he and lily stood up together and put their wands at the ready they marched out of the house and came face to face with lord voldemort himself however before they could survey the scene spells began to fly death eaters descended upon them and ran through the crowd shooting spells at random lily and james quickly blocked any spells that were coming their way and then shot counter spells of their own but they were outnumbered there were 20 death eaters and then there was voldemort leave the children to me he told his followers lily and james battled as many death eaters as they could to protect the muggles but soon found themselves in the air and flying towards voldemort they landed in front of him and he smiled at them wickedly young potter i wondered when we were going to meet again voldemort said in his raspy death like voice last time we met your dear parents met their bitter ends james lunged at voldemort ready to take him on with his bare hands but he was soon stopped with a simple flick of voldemort wand james found himself unable to move frozen in place i should have guessed you would take up with a mudblood but who can blame you she is very pretty isntshe voldemort grinned menacingly james used all of his strength to break free of the spell and grabbed he wand when he was sent sailing backwards and landed with a loud thud voldemort turned to lily miss evans we haventmet before and yet i feel insulted that i wasntinvited to the wedding voldemort cackled he was as horrible as she had imagined he would be his cold unfeeling eyes showed no mercy or restraint leave my family alone lily threatened she was shaking all over but nothing was going to keep her from fighting for her parents lives she looked at them and saw the fear in their eyes or what miss evans are you going to fight me voldemort said with a snicker in his voice without hesitating he pointed his wand at lily parents and killed them on the spot lily screamed and ran towards them but voldemort kept her from moving foolish girl voldemort said i going to enjoy killing potter and when i done i will come for you go near him and you will die lily said with pain and anger in her voice you d die for him would you voldemort asked let test that theory voldemort pointed his wand at lily and yelled avada kedavra protego lily shouted to conjure a shield and then she dove to escape the killing curse avada kedavra lily shouted and a green bolt of lightening shot out of her wand and headed towards voldemort however he was quick and managed to shield himself by letting one of his death eaters take the blast the body fell lifelessly to the ground lily stood stunned at what she had just done she stared at the dead body in front of her and the whole world seemed to stop moving well done miss evans voldemort said use your anger voldemort pointed his wand at lily to end this trivial game he was playing but as he shot his spell james appeared and pushed lily out of the way they both fell to the floor and james protected lily with his entire body excellent i came here for you in the first place voldemort said as he stared at james here i am james yelled so let not waste any time talking james shot the first spell but voldemort easily deflected it james continued using every spell he could think of to hold voldemort at bay impedimenta james yelled and voldemort was knocked off his feet james advanced on him but was soon flying through the air and then slammed into a wall he got up and flung a stunning spell that had little effect i tired of this potter voldemort said darkly before james had any warning a killing curse was heading towards him he looked at lily lying still on the ground and realized he would never see her again i love you he whispered thanks mate you should after i about to save your blooming arse sirius said as he formed a protective shield around himself and james james had never been so glad to see sirius in his life he looked around and saw that the order had arrived and were now battling the death eaters however voldemort was still going unopposed let do this together sirius said as he and james stared at voldemort they put their arms around each other and faced voldemort like men avada but before they finished the curse voldemort had apparated away coward james yelled he then ran over to lily who was still lying on the ground sirius joined him as they tried to wake her up enervate james yelled lily opened her eyes and when she saw james and sirius she began to cry and once she started she didntstop james wrapped his arms around lily and she sunk into him he held her tightly trying to absorb all of her pain and hurt around them ministry medi witches performed healing spells on muggles and also erased memories of the events that just occurred petunia had been so hysterical that she was given a strong sleeping draft and vernon had taken her home lily parents bodies still lay untouched with expressions of fear plastered to their faces sirius got up to make sure that the ministry properly took care of lily parents he left james to comfort lily as she continued to sob in anguish miss evans mr potter i need to talk with you about what happened here a ministry official said james looked up at the official with contempt now is not the time go away james snarled as lily continued to cry on his shoulder james felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to find dumbledore i believe what mr potter means is that miss evans is in no condition to give an accurate report of today events perhaps the interview can take place at a later date dumbledore suggested and the young ministry worker left them alone thank you sir james said slightly embarrassed that dumbledore had heard him rudely tell off someone from the ministry however at this point james really didntcare about what other people thought he just wanted to protect lily and shield her from the pain he picked up lily and carried her inside he opened the door to her bedroom and placed her gently on the bed she was asleep now after having been administered a strong sleeping draught james curled up next to her small body and wrapped his arms around her he didntsleep however he wanted to be awake incase lily woke up author note here the next chapter i promised i hope to have this part of the story done soon so let me know what you think thanks for the reviews of last chapter lily woke up with a jolt she sat straight up and pulled her wand out she looked around the room searching for danger and she soon discovered that she wasntalone james lay sleeping next to her on the bed he was snoring softly he had stayed with lily all night and had just fallen asleep an hour ago lily extricated herself from his hold and lifted herself of off the bed she stood up and immediately the events of the previous night flooded back to her the faces of her parents just before they died flashed before her and she started to sob lily crying stirred james from his sleep he opened his eyes and saw lily standing in the middle of the room sobbing she was crumpled over as her small body was wracked with sorrow james moved swiftly to pull lily into his arms she rested her head on his chest and clung to him it all my fault lily moaned james looked down at her and placed a kiss on the top of her head this isntyour fault lily it his fault james said angrily he thought about his own parents whose lives had been cut short he knew that there was nothing that he could say that could bring lily parents back so he just held her tightly if i wasnta witch they would still be here lily continued they loved you for who you are lily they wouldnthave wanted it any other way james said soothingly when lily tears finally stopped she was exhausted she collapsed into james arms and he laid her back on her bed she was asleep again james kissed her and then decided he would go downstairs to see about the aftermath of the attack he entered the kitchen to find sirius remus and chloe sitting at the table with sleep deprived looks on their faces how she doing chloe asked quietly as she saw james enter the room she stopped crying and now she is sleeping james said sirius told james that the order had captured six death eaters but voldemort had escaped ten muggles had died including lily parents and her aunt caroline james groaned when he heard this you re lucky to be alive james remus said however james looked dead to the world he had nearly lost lily last night not to mention his own life he was haunted by the look on voldemort face as he had cast a killing curse on lily sirius looked at james and knew what he was thinking he put his arm around james shoulder for comfort she going to be alright mate sirius offered a little while later james decided to go back upstairs to check on lily he didntwant her to wake up and be alone he took the stairs two at a time and when he got to the landing where lily room was he panicked her door was open and when he looked inside she wasntthere he proceeded to search every room on the floor and finally he came to lily parents room he opened the door and found lily sitting on the floor she wasntcrying but she looked to be in physical pain james approached her and then knelt down beside her you werentthere lily said numbly as she wrapped her arms around her knees i so sorry love i just went downstairs to check on the state of things i came right back james said he rubbed lily back soothingly but she didntseem to notice i just want to be alone for a little while lily said not looking at james when she spoke james didntpretend that her words didnthurt at the moment he would do anything in the world to take away the pain that she was feeling and yet she wouldntlet him comfort her ok james gave in i ll be here when you need me he got up and gave lily a kiss on the top of the head she continued to stare at the wall as he left her in her desired solitude she heard the door shut and closed her eyes pain rushed into her heart as she pictured her parents in this room she remembered the smell of her mother perfume as she was getting ready for a party she saw her father in his old bathrobe that her mother constantly urged him to throw out as a little girl she and her sister would crawl into bed every sunday morning with their parents and snuggle they would sleep late and then her father would go downstairs and make breakfast for his girls he would bring up trays of food for each of them and they would eat happily and enjoy being a family she had no family anymore lily thought to herself bitterly her parents were dead and her sister undoubtedly would never speak to her again in one day her world had been turned upside down the only thing she wanted was to hear her parents voices again and she knew she never would she sat there in their room trying to absorb any last pieces of them that she could however without them it was just a room there was no laughter or love just a cold wood floor james found a chair in the hallway and took a seat he wanted to be there as soon as lily was ready to come out so he waited for what seemed like an eternity it took every ounce of his strength not to go back in that room and pull her to him he was just glad that she was alive finally he heard the door crack and lily walked out she was wearing a large sweatshirt that was undoubtedly her father s she looked so small wrapped up in the large garment james stood up but lily didntsay anything he waited for her to come to him but instead she just kept walking his heart sank as he followed her down to the kitchen he didntwant to lose her over this not when he had come so close to losing her forever a few hours ago everyone looked up when they saw lily walk in the kitchen they all stood up and hugged her she sat down next to chloe and james was forced to sit across from her sirius and remus both looked at james and from his expression they understood instantly what was happening the group sat in silence waiting for lily to say something does anyone want some tea lily asked everyone looked at her with surprise they expected hurt anger sorrow but not coffee lily got up from the table and immediately headed over to the stove to put a kettle on james got up and followed her he watched as she waited for the water to boil and then as she painstakingly filled the china tea cups with hot liquid however her hands shook as she poured the water james took the kettle from her and she grabbed it back lily you donthave to james said she turned towards him and he saw anger in her bright green eyes donttell me what to feel if i want to make tea i will lily shot james took a step backwards confused as to why lily was acting like this he d just wanted to keep her from breaking one of her mother tea cups lily took the tray of tea over to the table and everyone took a cup they continued to sit in silence until a sudden pop assured them they were not alone james looked at sirius and remus and they had their wands out already chloe had hers trained on the door sirius gave james a look that told him to stay with lily and he and the others would go investigate the intruder in a protective instinct james moved closer to lily sirius cautiously peered around the door however he was knocked over when the door abruptly opened expelliarmus chloe and remus shouted and dumbledore wand shot straight out of his hand dumbledore looked surprised as he saw his wand sail into chloe outstretched hand sorry professor we thought you might be more death eaters chloe mumbled as she handed him his wand back perfectly understandable after last night events dumbledore said kindly however behind dumbledore stood a large brooding man with the scarred face and a magical eye that stared at everyone in the room eternal vigilance i always say albus i would have taken your head off if you had popped in on me like that blood good aurors this lot will make the man said in a gruff menacing voice that why i appointed you to watch my students alastor dumbledore said everyone looked at alastor mad eye moody in awe he was the most feared auror in the ministry and from looking at him it was easy to understand why he looked positively dangerous i was hoping to have a word with miss evans and mr potter if they are feeling up to it dumbledore said james looked at lily and she nodded they followed him silently back into the living room he performed a quick charm that would keep them from being overheard miss evans i am so sorry about your parents dumbledore began my door is always open to my students and my friends if you need to talk lily thanked him for his kind offer unfortunately my visit isntunder happy pretenses dumbledore continued have you caught him yet lily asked angrily i afraid he has escaped and none of the death eaters that we captured are willing to tell us of his whereabouts although i highly doubt they would know dumbledore said bloody cowards james said i have come to speak with you about something extremely important lord voldemort has taken an interest in the two of you dumbledore said with regret what could he want with us lily asked i assume he is threatened by you dumbledore replied lily and james looked at dumbledore with confusion two seventh year students were no match for lord voldemort and he had proved that last night however dumbledore looked at the head boy and girl and understood perfectly why voldemort was threatened by james and lily i dontunderstand professor we are just students what could he possibly want with us lily responded it quite simple miss evans while lord voldemort is powerful there is one type of magic he doesntunderstand and therefore he fears it and that is love dumbledore said james looked at lily and she didntreturn his gaze i ve come to tell you that i am placing you under the supervision of the order when you arentinside the halls of hogwarts dumbledore said breaking the silence james protested claiming that if he ever met voldemort again one of them wasntwalking away and it wasntgoing to be him james i urge you to consider what is at stake here your lives dumbledore said rationally the protection of the order is the only thing i can offer lily didntsay anything she just nodded her head that showed her approval for dumbledore plan she thanked dumbledore for coming and walked back upstairs to her bedroom a quick word james dumbledore said before james had the chance to leave he room yes sir james asked hesitantly dontget discouraged she will come around she helped you heal now its your turn to help her dumbledore said wisely thank you professor james said and then made his exit everyone was asleep and james sat in the kitchen staring at the wall he was deep in thought and didntrealize that he wasntalone anymore i didntthink anybody else was awake lily said as she took a seat next to james with everything that happened i guess i couldntsleep what keeping you awake james asked although he already knew what was troubling her does the pain ever go away lily asked she looked disheveled wearing a pair of old pajamas and her hair was piled sloppily on top of her head but james thought she looked beautiful eventually it becomes more bearable james said in fact you played a large part in helping me heal lily smiled at the thought and how d i do that lily asked coyly james moved closer to her until their faces were almost touching i can show you if you d like james replied with a grin i think you ll have to refresh my memory lily replied breathlessly james cupped her face in his hands and kissed her lightly on the lips lily started to feel the warmth that she had been missing spread through her body she returned his kiss craving more she needed to feel their love it was the only thing that could help her take the pain away james lily pleaded between kisses i only want love i d do anything for you lily james murmured in her ear at that suggestion she took his hand and began to lead him upstairs james could do nothing but follow when the entered her bedroom she moved towards the bed and pulled james with her she began removing his clothes and her own slowly and deliberately he stared down at her in awe of her beauty are you sure this is what you want james asked as she started to kiss him again i need to have you love me i need it to feel good and right again make me whole lily pleaded he looked into her eyes and was seduced he never thought it was possible that he could love someone this much she looked up at him with earnest vulnerability on her face and he leaned down to kiss her he would take her pain away lily and chloe walked around the camp grounds for the quidditch world cup looking for a place to set up both girls had puddlemere united badges on and were cheerfully chatting about their team prospects obviously puddlemere has a superior seeker and their chasers are phenomenal lily said excitedly yes and we all know that the vratsa vultures have been scored on more than your sister chloe chided you know that would be a lousy thing to say if i actually liked my sister but it the truth so i cannot deny it lily laughed the two girls continued to talk about the upcoming match and hardly noticed when four figures approached them and started to snigger lily and chloe turned around and came face to face with lucius malfoy severus snape bellatrix black and rodulphus lestrange well if it isntthe mudblood and her filthy blood traitor friend lucius spit out with a cackle take your friends and piss of malfoy i wouldntwant to have to curse you lily said with gritted teeth evans how dare you speak to me have some respect or i will be forced to teach you how to treat your superiors malfoy spat back snape attempted to get his friends to leave lily and chloe alone however malfoy would not relent he happened to enjoy making insolent uppity witches break bellatrix and rodulphus just stood in the background with sinister expressions on their faces to them muggleborns were nothing more than filth trying to pollute pure blood wizarding society lily and chloe stood there with their fists clenched and their wands ready to move if it became necessary all of the color drained out of lily face as she became enraged at the insults malfoy slung at her she couldntstand to be insulted because of her muggle heritage she was just as powerful as any of the slytherins who stood before her she was after all hogwarts dueling champion a prefect and top student how dare someone insult her talent she had enough she pulled at her want and pointed it straight at malfoy chest chloe followed suit and pointed her wand at the bellatrix and rodulphus the girls realized they were outnumbered but they were ready for a fight give me a reason malfoy and i wonthesitate to shut you up lily said forcefully her face turned a crimson red and her eyes showed her determination go ahead mudblood i guarantee you donthave the courage lucius said with a laugh before malfoy had a chance to continue with his verbal abuse his legs started to wobble uncontrollably he fell to the ground and was unable to get up he heard someone growl behind him the jelly legs jinx works like a charm every time james said with a menacing look on his face why dontyou run along and pick on someone who you actually have a chance of beating james said in a dark tone james released him from the spell and malfoy got up and dusted himself off sirius and remus came up behind james and pointed their wands at malfoy so he had no choice but to retreat james looked at lily and tried to give her a smile but he couldntbring himself to do it the unpleasant encounter he had witnessed reminded him too much of seeing his mother killed it had been that image in his head that motivated him to sprint over to the scene and hex malfoy the look in malfoy eyes was similar to the one voldemort had when he killed his mother he showed no remorse and that was what frightened james the most lily saw the expression on james face and she saw a sign of maturity thanks for the help james but i could have handled malfoy and his posse on my own lily said quietly i sure you could have but i thought i had the advantage of the element of surprise james said with a half hearted smile so where is your family potter lily said hopping to lighten up the mood james looked at her and his face twisted in pain he didntknow how to respond to her he looked into her emerald eyes and he wanted to let out all of the pain he was feeling and tell her what he was feeling however that was impossible lily wanted nothing to do with him and he didntwant to bother her with his problems so james did the only thing he could he turned around and left lily stared at james as he walked out of the clearing and back into the woods she looked to sirius and remus for an explanation because she was speechless james looked as if something had died inside of him and lily felt the sudden urge to run after him and comfort him remus looked at sirius as if they were debating who would speak first sirius just shook his head and stared at the ground what is wrong with james is it something i said lily asked with a pleading look in her eyes sirius ran his hands through is pitch black hair and looked at the worried look in lily face lily you canttreat james like dirt then expect to know what is bothering him you are either in his life or you aren t sirius more viciously then he intended sirius decided to follow his broken friend and left remus lily and chloe in silence lily was shocked by the harshness of sirius words she had no idea what she had done and she was confused by james and sirius action when he is ready if he chooses to tell you he will remus said quietly with that he turned around and left lily and chloe were dumbstruck they had never seen such a serious side of any of the marauders lily was impressed by the loyalty that sirius and remus had shown james but what sirius had said stuck with her did she want to be a part of james life she shook her head at the thought james was still an immature prat who didntcare about other people feelings lily and chloe went back into their tent and settled down for the night they continued to discuss the cup and chose to ignore what happened with both malfoy and james however lily couldntshake the look on james face when she had asked about his parents he had looked hollow and that was not the james potter she knew and hated the next morning chloe and lily woke up with huge smiles on their faces they hurriedly got dressed and threw on puddlemere united colors they decided to get to the pitch early so they could see the teams warm up they began the long walk up to the field thousands of wizards started to pour into the stadium that had been created for the event the girls quickly found their seats and watched the rest of the fans do the same wizards had come from all over the world to see the event supporters of the vratsa vultures wore large hats with vultures on top puddlemere united fans wore large badges and navy blue robes to show their support lily and chloe were so busy taking in the scene that they didntnotice who sat next to them lily turned to her left and found james potter sirius black and remus lupin james didntseem to notice that they were next to each other he seemed to be off in another world something inside lily made her tap him on the shoulder he turned and came face to face with two piercing green eyes hello lily james said softly he tried his best to give her a smile lily looked at james and he looked different to her he had a look of maturity and wisdom in his eyes fancy seeing you here potter here to try and ruin to world cup for me i bet you are even rooting for the vultures lily said sarcastically she didntknow what made the harsh words come out but she didntknow how to speak civilly to james james looked at lily in disbelief he had done nothing to deserve her cold attitude he had simply said hello if you want i can leave i didntmean to offend you i ll have remus take my seat james said with a hurt look in his eyes potter what is with you why are you rolling over like a kicked dog lily said i cantwin with you lily i haventdone anything to upset you james said finally deciding to fight back i dontunderstand you at school you are rude arrogant and constantly pestering me to go out with you and now you are trying to act like a martyr if this is some new scheme to win me over it wontwork lily said defiantly lily words stung james he looked at her determined face and let out a sigh this was one battle he would never win lily was stubborn and that was one of his favorite qualities about her he ran his hands through his already messy hair as if he was pondering his next move maybe people change evans james finally said with that said he got up and went over to remus and asked to switch seats with him remus gave james a funny look and obligingly got up and moved next to lily lily gave a huff and turned her attention to the pitch no matter what james potter did he managed to make her blood boil soon both teams were circling around the pitch getting ready for the match to start as the announcer introduced the teams lily and chloe cheered loudly for their favorite players the two captains shook hands and the game began puddlemere started off with the quaffle and as they passed it effortlessly between each other the chasers quickly moved into hawkshead attacking formation puddlemere scored easily but the vultures were quick to respond their beaters managed to send a bludger straight at famed chaser tom hill and he dropped the quaffle the vulture chasers quickly gained possession and seemed to perfect the reverse pass as they continued to allude the puddlemere beaters however the puddlemere beaters joined forces and slammed a bludger straight at the lead chaser the quaffle went free and the puddlemere chasers quickly gained control the chasers had a break away and scored quickly yes lily shouted loudly she got odd looks from chloe and the marauders she quickly sat back in her seat with a face that was crimson from embarrassment who knew lily was such a quidditch fan sirius whispered in james ear james looked at lily and blushed her red hair was flowing wildly and her face with lightened up by a large smile james stared at the happy lily and smiled she felt his stare and turned an even deeper shade of red she wished he would look somewhere else so she could be free to enjoy the game what are you staring at potter girls can enjoy quidditch too lily yelled over the roar of the crowd james quickly turned away and went back to focusing on the game he was just in time to see the vultures tie up the game soon the seekers were off and james fixed his gaze on the competition before him the puddlemere seeker aaron gold sped his broomstick straight towards the ground james held his breath as the vultures seeker tried to catch up but gold was too fast james saw gold wrap his hand around the snitch and the game was over puddlemere united had won 200 to 50 the crowd roared with happiness and lily let out a yell of delight she grabbed chloe and the two jumped up and down with excitement as james looked on with amusement lily quill scratched away on the peace of parchment before her she was working on her charms homework for the summer and her foot long essay on the usefulness of concealment charms was almost done she looked at her essay with pride and guessed that professor flitwick would give her top marks after all she was at the top of her class in charms she let out a groan as she pulled her potions assignment out of the bag professor staple scared lily making potions her worst subject however if she was to become an auror she would need to take the class in her final year so she was determined to try her hardest and earn top marks in the class lily was suddenly interrupted when an owl began to peck at her window she immediately recognized the owl as one from hogwarts she opened the window and the large golden owl dropped his package on her bed lily opened the letter that would inevitably welcome her to her seventh year at hogwarts and tell her what books to buy suddenly her mouth dropped dear miss evans i am pleased to announce that you have been chosen as this year head girl enclosed is your badge along with your list of school supplies for the upcoming year as head girl you will be encouraged to set a good example for you fellow school mates so please take that into account we look forward to seeing you at the start of term sincerely professor minerva mcgonagall deputy head mistress lily stared at the letter in disbelief and then let out a shout of joy she had always believed that gillian bones a ravenclaw prefect would get the honor she jumped up onto her bed and began to bounce soon her mother and father came barging in her room trying to locate the source of all the commotion lily dear are you ok we heard a scream lily mother said in a concerned voice mum i ve been made head girl lily cried mr and mrs evans beamed with pride lily was soon covered in kisses and hugs by both of her parents they were proud of her accomplishments lily that is terrific congratulations do you know who will be head boy with you mrs evans asked excitedly lily looked at her letter again to see if anything had been mentioned about who the head boy was she ran through a list of possible names in her head and then her heart stopped when she came upon james potter she shook her head at the thought professor dumbledore would never make some one who had managed to break every school rule in the book head boy she assumed remus lupin would be her partner after all he was a prefect and much more cool headed than he fellow marauders or perhaps amos diggory would get the job he was on the hufflepuff quidditch team and a prefect plus he earned top marks and managed to stay out of trouble lily trusted dumbledore judgment and decided not to worry about it for the time being she quickly sent an owl off to chloe to tell her the good news the two girls decided to rendezvous in diagon alley to buy their books and new robes for the year chloe stepford stood with her hands on her hips and her foot tapping irritably as she waited for lily to show up they had agreed to meet at 12 oclock sharp and lily was at least thirty minutes late chloe took a swig of her butterbeer and stared at the front door of the leaky cauldron she clicked her fingernails on the table and looked impatiently for any sign of her tardy friend then the door flung open and a flash or red hair came barreling through the door lily tried to catch her breath as the plopped down in the seat next to chloe lily evans i have been waiting her for you for thirty minutes i was harassed by a hag and then some cloaked figure tried to pick me up i cantbelieve you left me here waiting for so long chloe said with frustration i am so sorry chloe my dad got completely lost and then i had to say my goodbyes oh you should have seen the look on petunia face when i left i actually saw her smile lily said jokingly as she hoped it would lighten chloe mood chloe let out a little laugh as she tried to picture lily sister with anything but a sour look on her face alright well lets get going i want to get some new robes and then stop by quality quidditch supplies the new clean sweep is out and i want to admire its beauty chloe said quickly she grabbed lily hand and they were soon walking through the colorful streets of diagon alley they first went to the bookshop to pick up their new texts lily pulled out her list and gave it to the owner she was soon saddled with standard book of spells grade 7 her potions charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration arithmancy and care of magical creatures books she groaned at the amount of books that was put before her more books meant more work and that was one thing she was not looking forward to chloe grabbed her books and the girls were on their way they stopped by robes for all occasions where they picked up new skirts ties shirts and cloaks they were in the dressing room trying clothes on when they heard someone laugh manically lily poked her head out and saw bellatrix narcissa and andromeda black bellatrix was tall and dark with long black hair and black eyes narcissa had pale skin with blonde hair her nose pointed up so it looked as if she was always smelling something terrible lily detested her for dating lucius malfoy narcissa was weak and easily controlled and lily figured that was what lucius found appealing about her andromeda was different much to the dismay of her family she was not a slytherin but a hufflepuff she had soft features and a kind look about her lily liked andromeda and felt sorry for her because of her dark family bellatrix saw lily face popping through the curtains of her dressing room and an evil smile developed on her face hello mudblood where is potter to come rushing to your aid bellatrix sniggered where is rodulphus lestrange so you can hide behind him like the coward you are lily spat back i hide behind no one you little twit one day you will see what i am capable of bellatrix said evenly bellatrix grabbed her purchases and left the dressing room lily evans would rue the day that she crossed her narcissa turned to do the same but quickly turned around and stared crossly at lily no one makes a fool out of lucius and lives to tell about it narcissa said arrogantly narcissa grabbed her little sister and the two marched off to find bellatrix andromeda turned around and gave lily a sympathetic look and lily returned it with a smile chloe came out of her stall with her wand at her side you know i reckon they are right lucius is going to want revenge for what happened i just hope he goes after james and not us chloe said worriedly lily tried to hide her concern and decided it was time for them go grab some ice cream the girls ordered their favorite flavors and sat happily under the colorful umbrellas of the ice cream shop chatting about the upcoming year the two girls discussed their classmates and gossiped about who was dating who when they were interrupted by sirius black he had crashed straight into their table and knocked everything over he managed to land on top of lily and her ice cream flew out of her hands and landed on the ground oye black get off of me lily said irritably sirius flashed her a smile and smirked at their compromising position are you sure you want me to do that lily most girls would be thrilled to be in your position sirius grinned get up sirius or i will force you to lily said again fine its your loss sirius replied cockily remus and peter came running over to make sure that their friend was ok they saw who sirius managed to interrupt and let out a groan remus reached down to offer lily a hand and she took it as she pulled herself up and dusted off her clothes please tell me how you managed to crash into our table and land on top of me lily said crossly after she had straightened herself out well i was attempting to catch a remembral that moony i mean remus and i were throwing around sirius said quickly lily looked at remus and he began to blush he didntwant her to think that he was as immature as the rest of his friends peter stood behind remus hopping that lily wouldntnotice that he was there her yelling terrified him grow up boys lily finally said she found herself looking around for the fourth marauder james she assumed he was really to blame for the accident and had sent remus to take the fall arentyou missing someone in your little group lily asked sarcastically remus and sirius looked at each other and began to laugh he didntfeel like coming he is in his room at the leaky cauldron why do you care lily do you wish he had fallen on you instead of me sirius asked cheekily come of it black i would have been squished by that enormous head of his lily said trying to keep her cool yet somehow she felt her cheeks begin to flush chloe noticed this and decided she would ask lily about it later it just couldntbe true that lily thought james was less than vile well see you on the train tomorrow remus said as he ushered his friends away from lily and chloe he smiled softly at the girls and apologized for his and sirius behavior that night at the leaky cauldron lily and chloe lay in their beds talking chloe thought it was the perfect time to ask her about the day events she thought it was time to get to the bottom of what lily was really feeling so today when sirius teased you about james you blushed what is that all about i thought you hated james chloe asked carefully lily looked at her friend and gave her a look of shock she sat straight up in bed and stared at chloe she was surprised at how perceptive chloe was and how well she knew her but then again they were best friends i still dontlike james but you have to admit that something is different i saw it at the world cup lily said yeah he seems like something is bothering him chloe replied yes well i sure he will get over it and go back to being a brute lily said with that she turned over and face the wall she said goodnight to chloe and closed her eyes yet somehow james kept popping into her head for some odd reason she felt as if he needed her she tried to shake the feeling and cleared her mind she fell into a deep peaceful sleep a couple of rooms down james woke up covered in sweat he tried to shake off the dream but somehow every night he had the same one he envisioned his father trying to fight off voldemort as his mother ran towards the house his father would quickly be hit by the killing curse and his mother would let out a long agonizing scream voldemort then turned to his mother and with no mercy he killed her james could see the expression on her face when she died and that was what woke him up every time he looked over to see his three friends sleeping deeply and decided not to wake them he slid back down under his covers but kept himself awake so he wouldnthave to relive his nightmare again author note sorry for all of the technical difficulties i am new to fanfiction and uploading documents is beyond my capabilities so i had to delete the story and repost all the chapters plus this one unfortunately that means i lost the wonderful reviews i received so tell me what you think i will try and update again soon whitepaw thanks for reviewing and to answer your question i definitely think that hermione and ron will be an item i also think that harry and ginny will get together because jk is obviously building her character up and making her out to be a pretty clever witch i dontthink hermione and harry will get together because they act like brother and sister marauders girl 08 thanks for the review i will try and crank out another chapter soon lily stared out of the window of her transfiguration class and watched the leaves fall on the ground professor mcgonagall droned on about the difficulties of self transfiguration and how if done wrong a person could be permanently disfigured she cited how one unfortunate wizard had ended up with a chair leg for an arm after trying unsuccessfully to become a rocking chair this was all review for lily as she had already studied for the upcoming exam so she chose to spend her time day dreaming and thinking about the upcoming hogsmede trip her train of thought was interrupted when mcgonagall rapped her wand on her desk lily looked up and the whole class immediately came to attention because usually when mcgonagall needed attention it meant that a pop quiz was in the works before class ends i feel it is time that i assign your newt level project that will be due before winter break mcgonagall said with a serious tone the whole class let out a groan and began searching around for partners lily quickly locked eyes with chloe and they agreed to work together across the room james and sirius did the same your project will be to use an advanced transfiguration theory that we have practiced in class and make a presentation to the class this will take a lot of practice and creativity so i suggest you dontprocrastinate mcgonagall continued everyone began to rack their brains for possible ideas but was interrupted when mcgonagall cleared her throat again and in order to prepare you for after graduation i have decided to assign you all partners because in the real world you will not always get to choose who you get to work with mcgonagall said with a knowing smile lily looked across the room and prayed that she wouldntbe assigned to work with a slytherin she saw severus snape turn around and look at her with a smile and her stomach dropped three months of work with someone she hated would be torture so listen carefully for your name mckinnon and malfoy walker and bellatrix black stepford and pettigrew nott and flowers lupin and hill snape and sirius black and finally potter and evans mcgonagall announced james looked for lily and when he found her piercing green eyes he gave her a grin lily didntknow what to feel she was happy she hadntbeen partnered with a slytherin but she felt uneasy about having to spend so much time with james although he had stopped constantly pestering and baiting her she felt uncomfortable around him because she didntreally know how to act their relationship had always consisted of arguing and now she didntreally know what to say to him in the past week they had barely said anything to each other but a few fleeting words mcgonagall dismissed the class and everyone started complaining about their partners who does mcgonagall think she is does she want me to commit murder i cantstand that grease ball how am i going to spend three months working with him sirius whined i mean at least you three got gryffindors and people who actually shower its karma for trying to kill him last year remus growled he had not completely forgiven sirius for the incident sirius looked at remus and immediately backed down they were obviously not at the stage where they could look back on the episode and laugh sirius still remembered how remus refused to talk to him for a month afterwards and it had taken three months for them to be friends again talk about luck prongsie you and lily are obviously going to get the top marks in the class and set an impossible bar to pass sirius finally said trying to change the subject yeah was all james could get out he was too busy staring at lily and her friends lily didntseem upset at the idea of having to work with him which was a huge change he still remembered how in the fourth year she had marched straight up to the potions master and demanded that she not work with him on a project in fact lily seemed to be smiling and laughing as marlene did an impression of lucius malfoy i cantbelieve i have to work with that dolt marlene shouted loud enough for the whole school to hear james decided to take advantage of lily good mood and press his luck he ran up to her and tapped her on the shoulder lily turned around and came face to face with james chest at 6 1 he was a great deal taller than her slender 5 4 frame she looked up into his hazel eyes and gave him a quizzical look can i help you potter lily asked i just wanted to know if you would like to meet in the library tonight after quidditch practice to start on the project james said quickly usually when james asked lily something it ended up in a disaster and he looked like a fool so he wanted to make this a quick as possible lily looked at james and his nervous look couldnthelp but make her smile i can t i have detention with hardwick tonight but maybe tomorrow night after the prefect meeting lily responded oh yeah i forgot about that thanks by the way james said he turned around and went back to his friends he gave them a hopeful smile and they started to laugh that was the first time i haventseen you make a total ass out of yourself in front of her sirius joked yeah i was afraid she was going to start yelling again peter squeaked james just continued to smile he got back to his room and started getting dressed for quidditch practice as he was strapping his wrist guards he started to smirk he figured out a way to repay lily for slugging malfoy and to show her that he had changed at around six o clock that evening lily put her charms book back in her bag and told her friends she would see them later she had never been in detention before but sirius had told her that hardwick was usually a fair fellow about punishment so she was only slightly nervous i ll see you guys later lily said quickly hoping that nobody who question where she was headed however sirius and marlene both turned their heads at the same time and smiled at her have a good time in detention they both said in unison lily face turned red as the rest of the gryffindors turned to stare at their head girl lily exited the common room as quickly as possible to avoid further embarrassment she started the long walk to hardwick office and her stomach started to knot up later that night james came back through the portrait hole and was covered in mud from head to toe but he had a big smile across his face the rest of the team followed behind him but they were less than enthusiastic great practice guys keep it up and we will definitely beat slytherin james shouted as he ran up to his room to shower and change the rest of the team looked at james as if he was insane has he gone completely mental we were out there for hours i could barely see the bludgers whizzing past my head because it was so dark beater toby cryer lamented i can barely feel my arms because i threw so many quaffles chaser amanda bones said exhaustedly sirius remus and peter who were sitting around the fire working on their charms essays started to laugh james was definitely an enthusiastic captain and he had been known to over work his team to the point of exhaustion before the rest of the team had even started to clean up james came flying back down the stairs with wet hair and a cloak dragging behind him brilliant prongs is back in action what on the agenda for tonight sirius said as he saw james was carrying his invisibility cloak this usually meant that a prank was in the works sorry padfoot this is a solo trip james yelled behind him as he ran out of the portrait hole he just ditched us the bastard i wonder what he is up to sirius said in a disgruntled tone he hated being left out remus just laughed and gave sirius a knowing smile james only got so worked up about two things in life pranks and lily and he rarely pulled pranks by himself lily sat in detention scratching out lines with her quill luckily she had figured out to charm the quill to be self writing so all she had to do was sit there and stare at the parchment in front of her hardwick would look up from his work every so often to make sure that she was on task and this is when lily would have to grab the quill and pretend she was writing furiously she stared at the lines in front of her as they repeated i will not resort to using violence against my fellow students over and over again her head started to hurt and she was extremely hungry because she was forced to miss dinner to complete her homework before detention she listened to her stomach growl continually as she watched the minutes tick away on the enchanted clock above her suddenly a gryffindor third year charlie marks came barreling into the room and urgently handed professor hardwick a note hardwick quickly scanned the content of the piece of paper he had just been handed and he eyes grew very large i very sorry miss evans but i just received an urgent message from the ministry of magic i trust you to finish up your lines and then you are free to go hardwick said as he gathered he things lily just nodded her head and went back to her punishment hardwick had been gone for about five minutes when the door to the room mysteriously opened lily looked around the room and grabbed her wand ready to act she was sure it was a slytherin out for revenge who there lily shouted i not afraid to hex you she felt something move past her and she turned around and sent a hex flying into the air a couple of desks got knocked over and she heard a loud thud lily walked over to where the noise had come from and all of a sudden james head appeared out of thin air lily let out a scream but before anything came out james quickly put his hand over her mouth lily stared at james in disbelief potter what are you doing here she said shocked to see him standing before her is that any way to greet a person who is saving you from sheer boredom i figured since i am the reason you are in detention it my responsibility to bust you out james said with a grin lily had not seen him smile like that in a while and she felt her face start to flush his hand was still on her arm and she looked in his eyes and saw something deep and passionate how did you know that professor hardwick was going to leave lily said in disbelief oh that was simple i wrote the note and had my friend charlie deliver it james said beaming at his own genius i cantleave i promised hardwick that i would finish he will know if i left because my lines wontbe complete lily rebutted with one flick of his wand james charmed the paper to look as if it had been completed after seven years of detention james definitely knew some tricks of the trade a simple copying charm was all that was needed and lily lines were done sirius taught me that one james said he pulled lily close to him and told her to be quiet she started to protest but being so close to him made her nervous he threw his invisibility cloak over them and grabbed lily hand and started towards the door lily just followed in silence and for some reason she felt oddly comfortable with him they started to walk down the corridor as quietly as possible so as to not be detected by argus filch the caretaker of hogwarts where are we going lily whispered in james ear her hot breath on his skin sent shivers down his spine he started to smile and then turned around and put a finger on her lips to tell her to not make a sound it a marauders secret james mouthed the duo was interrupted when mrs norris filch cat came around the corner and lily almost stepped on her tail mrs norris stared at lily and james with her two yellow beady eyes and pawed the air as if she knew they were there they sucked in their breath and stayed as still as possible finally the cat continued on her way and both lily and james let out a sigh of relief they continued down the long dark hallway until they came to a statue of an owl james looked around to make sure no one was coming and pressed the statue a door automatically appeared and began to swing open james took lily hand and walked through the door into a dark room he waved his wand and the lights turned on to reveal a large kitchen filled james took lily over to a little wooden table and commanded her to sit a tiny house elf with nothing but an apron on soon appeared mr potter sir how wonderful to see you again can twiggy get you something sir the house elf said as he gave a great bow lily stared at james and was at a loss for words why was he doing this for her james saw the look on lily face and grinned sheepishly thank you twiggy it nice to see you too dontworry about us i sure i can find my way around the kitchen james said with a smile take a break and come join us wontyou mr potter is too kind twiggy would be honored to bring anything to him and his friend twiggy responded james and twiggy argued back and forth for a little bit but in the end twiggy came back with a full dinner for lily and a butterbeer for james lily ate her food hungrily and in between bites she enjoyed a nice warm cider james just stared at her and couldntbelieve that he hadntscrewed up yet they had never had an encounter that had lasted so long without a heated argument where she called him a prat and he called her cold finally lily looked up from her food and saw james looking at her with amusement i sorry i skipped dinner she said apologetically yeah i figured as much that why i brought you down here james said you seem awfully well known here i assume you spend a great deal of time in the kitchen lily said as she finished her last bite of food sirius and i discovered this place when we were let out late from a potions detention one night during out third year james said sirius is controlled by his stomach and wouldntstop complaining about how hungry he was so i remembered that a friend of mine who had graduated a few years earlier told me about a kitchen and after hours of pressing statues we finally found it how do you guys know so much about this school lily said with a great deal of interest to know that you have to become a marauder james said with a wink oh and how does one become part of the famous marauders group lily said sarcastically it really rather a painful process i nearly failed my marauders test you have to spend a whole day with sirius and not hit him once and trust me that not an easy feat james said in an official voice as if he had the answer memorized lily let out a laugh and playfully hit james on the shoulder they went on talking for a while and both realized that this was their first civilized conversation ever lily was amazed at how easy it was to talk to james he had a great sense of humor and she couldntstop laughing but she kept her guard up she still didntbelieve that a person could change overnight james just couldntbelieve that lily was giving him the time of day but he tried not to get too excited he knew lily would be a chase and that what he liked about her finally lily couldntkeep it in any longer she had to tell james she knew about his parents it just didntseem right to keep it from him james i just wanted to say that i am so sorry about your parents and if there is anything i can do please tell me lily said so quietly that he could barely hear her but james looked at her and his face turned to stone as he developed a pained expression he didntreally know how to respond he wanted to break down and tell her everything but he couldntbring himself to do it you know i wish people would stop saying that to me you dontunderstand what its like he after me lily and i have all of this pressure on me to avenge them james finally said i know what it is like to have expectations put on me i have to work twice as hard to prove myself because of who my parents are i not accepted by muggles or wizards lily said heatedly is that why you work so hard because you have nothing to prove to anyone god i hate it that he has done to our world james said angrily turning wizards against each other wizards because of who their parents are it just isntright that why i want to become an auror i want to fight against that type of attitude and put an end to all of the hatred lily said firmly i want to kill him lily james said quickly he had never admitted how he truly felt to anyone not even sirius no one knew the hatred and anger building up inside of him it was the thing that pushed him harder and harder each day he would bring voldemort downfall lily stared at james in shock and was not quite sure how to respond she had never seen such anger in someone she admired his passion but his intensity scared her dontstoop to his level james fight against him but remain a human as well dontlet your hatred for him consume you like he lets his lily said wisely james looked at lily and he began to smile she was so beautiful when she was being serious her shoulder length red hair framed her face and he wanted to reach out and touch her she seemed almost angelic as the light hit her porcelain skin and he admired her for her strength i need your help james finally said make me human lily stared at james and felt the urge to reach out to him she had never seen such an intense and mature side of him she finally reached across the table and grabbed his hand you can always count on me sirius remus and peter to be there for you she said softly thanks lily he murmured he stared into her emerald green eyes and immediately felt a weight lift off his shoulders he knew she would be there for him but something told him he wanted more he new he would have to take it slow with her though and in the end it would be worth it he looked at his watch and got up from the table its late we should probably head back to the room james said as he let out a yawn lily nodded her head and stood up and stretched they put the invisibility cloak back on and left the world that they had briefly shared to go back and face reality they quietly walked through the hallways and prayed they wouldntget caught when they got back to the common room they removed the cloak and started the stairs to their dormitories thanks for tonight james lily said as she started to go up the stairs to her dorm awe it was nothing it was my duty as a marauder to help fellow troublemakers out who are in need james said with a smile so does that officially mean i have dislodged that stick from my ass that you are always complaining about lily replied with a grin not yet there is still much work to be done but you made the first step james laughed lily grinned and walked up to her room james watched her and couldnthelp but pat himself on the back he had definitely made progress with her tonight he walked into his room to find all of his roommates fast asleep he started to undress and sirius rolled over and let out a grunt did she box you he said groggily no we managed to be civil towards one another james said as he pulled the covers back on his bed that good sirius said and with that he rolled over and promptly fell back asleep james lay in bed and thought about what lily had said about voldemort he was determined not to late his anger get the best of him there were better things to live for author note ok i know this is a long chapter but i thought it was time that they finally talked about something interesting so read and review and tell me what you think i know there are probably a bunch of grammar errors but its late at night and i too tired to edit
