 chapter 27 forming an army because his mum had overturned the end of his detentions with umbridge harry was able to attend the keeper tryouts on friday night ron turned up to tryout he said that his older brothers always made him keep for them when they practiced over the summer and he thought he would do alright he wasntthe best flyer or keeper who turned up but angelina chose him anyway because of the two better flyers one was a real whiner and the other admitted outright that she would put her other obligations before quidditch angelina took harry aside and asked him to help ron as much as he could the next day they went out to the pitch before the team practice and harry played chaser to give ron some practice he wasntgreat but he got better the longer they stayed out unfortunately when the rest of the team joined them ron got flustered and he missed many more quaffles than he saved gryffindor prospects for winning the cup this year did not look good at this point ron was going to need a lot more practice and a whopping dose of confidence before he was ready for a real game earlier that morning harry had sent a letter to sirius he knew his godfather felt bad that he hadntbeen more involved in harry life thus far and that he was sick of being cooped up and feeling useless so when he left on september first harry had promised to keep in touch frequently and tell sirius about everything at hogwarts he had worded his letter very carefully in case anyone else should happen to read it telling him about umbridge and that they were all curious about where hagrid might be the giant game keeper had been absent since the start of term and professor grubbly plank was filling in for him again no one would tell harry where hagrid was but he thought that maybe sirius would answer his questions he seemed less cautious than the rest of the adults in harry life cho came in just as harry finished sending his letter she had a parcel to send to her mum it was the first time harry had seen her since school started again thanks to his many detentions and he could tell she was upset with him for not seeking her out earlier hi he greeted her cheerfully how have you been oh you do remember me then cho said cautiously harry sighed look i sorry i haventhad any time for you this week you know i ve been in detention with umbridge every night that broke cho bad mood she horrible she said in a low voice i heard what happened on the first day it was really brave of you to stand up to her like that i cantbelieve she put you in detention for telling the truth harry heart soared she still believed in him yeah professor mcgonagall says we have to be careful around umbridge she from the ministry you know i know cho said but before she could continue filch burst in and accused harry of sending off a massive order for dungbombs how do i know you ve already sent it he asked suspiciously when harry told him the letter was gone because i saw him sent it cho said angrily filch left shortly after that and harry turned to cho with a grateful smile can i walk you to where ever you re going he asked hopefully of course she smiled at him and let harry walk her back to the ravenclaw common room do you have plans for this afternoon she asked yeah we ve got quidditch practice ron the new keeper harry explained oh she seemed disappointed well i guess i ll see you around then cho turned and went into her common room without so much as a hug or a kiss on the cheek for harry and he couldnthelp thinking that it was going to be difficult to continue on with her if she was going to get so easily upset over things he couldnthelp like quidditch practice and detentions he shook his head and went to the great hall to get some breakfast on monday morning there was an article on the front page of the daily prophet explaining that educational decree number twenty three had been passed making dolores umbridge the hogwarts high inquisitor this would give her the authority to inspect her fellow teachers and report back to the ministry on so called substandard teaching it was yet another attempt to take power from albus and bring him into question in the minds of the public he had been informed by owl the night before by the minister after reading the short letter albus had passed it to minerva who promptly crushed it in her fist and threw it into the fire after reading it once how dare he was all she said but it was enough it had been another long worried night for the couple and one look at albus face as he read the newspaper article the next morning told minerva that monday night would be the same percy weasley and lucius malfoy had both made some very disparaging remarks about albus and the way he ran the school and even though they both knew that each man was speaking from ignorance and prejudice it did not take the sting out of the words every wizard in the uk would have read this article by the end of the day and would come to the conclusion that albus was truly no longer fit to run the school minerva reached under the table and squeezed his knee in a reassuring gesture and he patted her hand in thanks but it felt like such an empty action to minerva how could she possibly help him get through this that night when he did not come to their rooms at his usual time minerva hurried into albus office and found him sitting quietly staring into space he heard her come in but didntturn his head to look at her when he spoke have i finally lost control of hogwarts minerva there was such despair in his voice it broke her heart crossing quickly to his side she took his face in her hands and forced him to look into her eyes no she shook her head sharply this is only temporary albus i believe we can get through this and you have to as well soon voldemort will make a mistake and everyone will see that you were telling the truth and they will owe you the biggest apology imaginable as they restore their faith in you for now just know that there are people here who believe in you i will always believe in you almost desperately she wrapped her arms around his neck and drew him to her wanting so badly to take his pain away albus stood and held her so tightly it was almost painful as he kissed her fiercely crushing her lips under his in a desperate move to take in as much of her comforting presence as he could his hands began to wander his fingers pressing firmly and lovingly into her flesh minerva stepped back a bit and albus was about to apologize when she placed her fingers lightly against his lips to silence him and took him by the hand to lead him through to their bedroom kicking off her slippers minerva moved to turn back the sheets but was hampered by albus arms around her waist his fingers deftly untying her dressing gown she turned in his arms and they fell into the bed together for a much needed night of passion albus slowed his previously aggressive advances and made love to minerva slowly and tenderly savoring her tender caresses and reveling in the warm loving sensation of being close to her letting her show him how much she loved and believed in him the next afternoon during her class with the fifth year gryffindors minerva was inspected by the high inquisitor she began the class attempting to act as if nothing unusual was going on and they had not been invaded by a most unwelcome presence but dolores insisted on interrupting her i wonder minerva said coldly how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me you see i do not generally permit people to talk when i am talking with that she turned her back on dolores and resumed teaching the class to vanish mice dolores said nothing further until the class ended but she took notes furiously on the parchment attached to her clip board at the end of class harry ron and hermione hung back in an attempt to listen to minerva conversation with dolores she permitted herself to be asked one more question before sweeping the three students out of the room with her harry grinned at her and she couldnthelp smiling back a little dolores would learn very quickly that minerva mcgonagall was not easily intimidated and that she had no intention of bowing under the ministry new influence at hogwarts minerva warned harry every time she saw him to keep his temper in umbridge classroom and eventually it sunk in she tried to provoke him again during the second week of classes and harry just closed his eyes and let his mum words play over and over in his mind calming himself down this visibly frustrated umbridge and she tried even harder to make him angry so he would shout at her again and she could put him back in detention it gave harry a great deal of satisfaction to be able to withstand her obvious plans and keep himself out of trouble he knew his parents would be proud of him as well and that was a wonderful feeling one night that week hermione had what harry thought was the craziest idea she ever had ron only made things worse by agreeing with her she wanted harry to teach them proper defense because not only did he know the spells but he knew what it was like to face voldemort in a real battle harry thought they were crazy didntthey realize that half of everything he had ever done was due to luck or unexpected help arriving at the right time he accidentally shouted at them not understanding why he was so angry all the time lately and hermione dropped the subject until two weeks later when the first hogsmeade weekend was announced she wanted to arrange a meeting for anyone who was interested in learning from harry at the hogshead of all places the hogshead are you crazy harry asked her incredulously what she asked innocently it always pretty empty and nobody from hogwarts goes in there we d have less chance of being overheard harry shook his head hermione in a less crowded place there will be more chance of being overheard not to mention the fact that a group of hogwarts students will stick out a mile in there besides he lowered his voice my uncle aberforth owns that place do you have any idea what kind of people go in there my mum would have all our heads if she found out we went in there and led a bunch of other students with us and trust me she would find out i ve never been allowed in there not even with my dad ron sat back trying hard to absorb all this new information all this time he had thought harry knew very little about the wizarding world but now he was turning out to know much more than ron finally he found something to say aberforth is that the one dumbledore said last year he wasntsure could read harry grinned yeah that him you know i not sure if he can read or not either i ve never seen him try hermione brought them back to the matter at hand well where can we meet then surely the three broomsticks is too crowded with people from hogwarts wouldntthat make it the perfect place ron asked nobody will notice anything unusual about a large group of students meeting in there on a hogsmeade day that seemed to settle it and hermione set about inviting people to meet them the next saturday harry had no idea she was going to ask as many people as she ended up bringing there was a total of twenty five people there most of whom it turned out just wanted to hear harry story from last june first hand he did not give them the satisfaction of telling the tale however harry had been pleased to see that cho arrived but she had brought with her a very suspicious and unfriendly girl named marietta edgecomb that harry did not completely trust hermione had everyone sign a pact that they would not speak of the defense group again and said they would inform everyone of the first meeting on monday morning there was a huge new notice plastered to the bulletin board in the gryffindor common room announcing educational decree number twenty four which put an end to all student organizations societies teams groups and clubs harry ron and hermione exchanged a look had they been overheard or had someone told on them hermione seemed to feel this proved her theory that the three broomsticks had been the wrong place but harry was pretty sure they would have been found out anyway he also thought that this could be a coincidence perhaps umbridge was just trying to assert her authority and make the students feel dependent on her permission for their activities word had of course reached albus and minerva about harry meeting in the three broomsticks there had been many people in the pub that day from both hogwarts and the ministry nothing could ever stay a secret for long in the wizarding world on monday night they discussed whether or not harry would carry on with it due to the new ban and whether or not they should approach him about it albus advocated waiting to see what happened he thought that harry might be capable of carrying on without getting caught and he had to admit he was proud of the students who wanted to prepare themselves for the eventualities although he sincerely hoped dolores would not catch them having meetings over the course of that day most student clubs and organizations had been given permission by umbridge to reform in fact the only group that had asked and not been granted permission was the gryffindor quidditch team and angelina was very unhappy about the loss of practice time she finally went to minerva who stormed once again into albus office grumbling about injustices and prejudice against her house albus was able to get dolores to reinstate gryffindor quidditch privileges thankfully and by tuesday they were practicing again in the meantime harry had received a note from sirius but hedwig had turned up in the middle of his history of magic lesson rather than at breakfast and looking very battered when he took her to the staff room looking for professor grubbly plank in hopes that she could mend the owl harry met his mum how far has that owl traveled she asked from london harry replied giving her a significant look and knowing that she understood him to mean from number 12 grimmauld place professor grubbly plank took hedwig and before she let him leave the staff room minerva reminded harry that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts were being watched he understood that she meant he had to be very careful what he put in writing and make sure sirius knew to be careful in his replies umbridge and the ministry had truly thought of every possible way to make life difficult for certain people at hogwarts all channels of communication also included the floo network which meant that harry and sirius could not communicate that way as they had occasionally in the past the only problem harry couldntsolve was how to warn sirius he couldntvery well send a letter stating the danger flat out that night they had a very brief quidditch practice in the pouring rain angelina finally stopped them when she realized that no one could see properly in the downpour as the team was drying off in the changing rooms harry felt his scar twinge it was not the first time it had happened since june but every time aside from the pain harry felt a sense of uneasiness that he was somehow sharing something with voldemort he and ron hung back from the rest of the team and when ron asked what happened harry heard himself declaring that voldemort was angry the words shocked harry as much as ron he hadntmeant to say it but looking back it was true when his scar twinged he felt a brief moment of anger was he now able to read the dark wizards emotions the first thing harry did when he got back inside the castle was bid ron goodbye and go looking for his parents he found them in his dad office quietly going over their plans to keep dolores authority at an absolute minimum she was starting to hand back results from her inspections and had provided albus with a copy of each professor performance rating most of them were terribly biased harry told them about his scar and the anger he had felt and albus confirmed his suspicions but harry noticed that his dad wasntlooking him in the eyes what was going on when he rose to leave a few minutes later albus shared a look with minerva and she got up to accompany harry back to the tower however when they got there she lead him into her sitting room rather than letting him go into the common room sit down harry we need to talk about something she said nervously harry sat and looked at her expectantly about why dad wouldntlook at me minerva nodded yes with these dreams you ve been having and now the fact that you seem to have developed a kind of radar for voldemort emotions your father is concerned about the eventualities of this situation that voldemort will figure out the connection and maybe try to use it harry offered nodding again minerva couldnthelp a small burst of pride that her son was so quick to figure things out yes she said again he worried that voldemort may try to use you as a means to get to him that he may attack through you we both know that you would never willingly attack anyone but if voldemort figures out a way to capitalize on this connection he may be able to control you and both your father and i realize how badly that would hurt you albus feels a need to distance himself from you a little bit in order to prevent this occurrence if voldemort were to realize how much time the two of you spend together he would not hesitate to use this information to his advantage i so sorry harry your father doesntwant to do this but he feels it is necessary for your protection i understand harry reassured her i dontlike it but i understand i certainly dontwant to attack anyone because voldemort hates them but what about you arentyou worried he might want to come after you minerva sighed i would only be useful to voldemort as a means of capturing or attacking either your father or yourself harry he would not find my destruction in and of itself to be beneficial to him at this time so no i am not worried that he will attack me through you any time soon good harry said with obvious relief i would hate to lose you both you re not losing your father harry she said gently he still loves you and wants to spend time with you hopefully this is only temporary i know that didntcome out quite the way i meant it but anyway i glad that you donthave to stay away from me this year he smiled at her sadly and then said he should go back and do his homework after he left minerva leaned back in her chair and sighed every day she was reminded of the fact that this was going to be a long hard year how she wished that her family did not have to be among the most deeply affected later on that week harry had the first meeting with the secret defense group they had formed in hogsmeade it had been difficult to think of a place to practice until he remembered a room that he had discovered as a child there was a room on the seventh floor that would only appear when one needed it and would be filled with whatever the person required at the time sometimes as a boy when he was bored harry would find the room filled with toys and games or if he was lost on his way to a meal there would be a small table with all his favorite foods it would be the perfect place to practice defensive spells and no one would be able to find them at the first meeting in the room of requirement hermione suggested that they should have a name cho suggested the defense association d a for short and ginny weasley spoke up to say they should call it dumbledore army since that was what fudge was afraid of everyone liked that idea and so they became dumbledore army known as the d a they began with basics such as disarming charms and harry walked among them assessing people level of skill very glad he had started with something simple as many of them needed a fair amount of work by the end of the hour however everyone in the room had made some progress toward accomplishing the disarming spell it gave harry a very good feeling to be doing something proactive to fight against dolores and the ministry influence at hogwarts to know he was preparing himself and his friends for the eventuality of fighting voldemort hermione came up with a very clever way to inform the members of meetings as the day and time often had to shift to accommodate the quidditch practices of three different houses every house except slytherin was represented in the d a she made a basket full of fake galleons and placed a protean charm on them so that whenever harry changed the numbers on the face of his to reflect the date and time each member would heat up and they could check to see when the next meeting would be it reminded harry very strongly of the dark mark burnt onto the forearm of the death eaters except that he wasntcausing anyone pain fluffy white cat actually those interviews were given prior to ootp minerva could have turned 70 at any point during the five books and most likely completed her schooling prior to 1942 the rest of what you said has no bearing on this story for the record for any reviewers i am aware of the 80 year age difference and so are the rest of the ad mm shippers and writers your small mindedness will not stop us so please keep it to yourselves life and love do not end at 40 hogwarts duo i should have said this a couple of chapters ago but i flattered you want to put this on your favorites list thanks for the vote of confidence quill of minerva oh no my dear that moment has been a huge part of my plans for this book since i very first started this project horrible as it is i afraid it will play a rather large role in this version as well chapter 28 the calm before the storm the start of the quidditch season was now fast approaching and tensions between gryffindor and slytherin who would be playing in the first match were high as always even the professors were getting caught up in the fervor harry was floored when his mum held off giving them homework for the entire week leading up to the game so that they could practice more the slytherins were especially horrible to ron having found out that when he missed one save he would become flustered and miss several more as a result he had never before experienced the taunting the way harry had and they managed to upset him quite a bit during the week during the actual game the entire slytherin section of the stands and the team sang a terrible song concerning ron lack of skills as a keeper any time the quaffle would near the gryffindor goal posts slytherin took an early lead and harry grew frantic to catch the snitch before malfoy did and win the game for gryffindor he finally saw it and after a frantic race against malfoy managed to wrap his hand around it just as madam hooch blew her whistle to end the game a bludger came flying in harry direction and hit him squarely on the small of his back he fell to the ground which luckily had been close and scrambled up just in time to see the rest of the team running forward to congratulate him all except ron malfoy started in with his insults right away about ron family and it took the entire gryffindor team to hold back fred and george harry wanted to hit malfoy himself but he fell back on the same methods he had employed recently in umbridge classroom to calm himself that was why when malfoy insulted harry dead parents harry did not react he was too busy intoning his mum words about keeping calm and not getting angry over and over to himself eventually madam hooch stopped yelling at crabbe for his illegal bludger attack and she came over to find out the cause of the disturbance just as george was about to struggle out of harry restraining hold she silenced malfoy and sent everyone off to the changing rooms knowing she had narrowly avoided having a nasty fight breakout ordinarily after a quidditch game especially one that gryffindor won albus and minerva would spend the rest of the afternoon in their rooms together playing chess or having their own little private celebration however this year they knew that it would be impossible and unadvisable for both of them to disappear for an entire afternoon so they separated to their individual offices upon re entering the school minerva was sitting at her desk going over some essays from the fourth years when there was a knock on the door come in she called oh it you dolores something you need dolores smiled broadly making minerva want to cringe actually i ve just come by to inform you of the newest educational decree minerva couldnthelp herself not another one she said with exasperation causing dolores to smile more widely still oh yes she said in that sickeningly sweet childish voice actually it was because of you that i realized we needed it you see when you overturned mr potter detentions and then went over my head to have the gryffindor quidditch team reformed i knew that i had to do something well i mean i canthave mere teachers able to override the high inquisitor can i she gave a false laugh and then cleared her throat with that horrible hem hem before reading out the decree giving her absolute power of approval over all punishments meaning she could change them as she saw fit and no other teacher could interfere with a detention she assigned minerva was appalled would even albus be able to intervene when she crossed a line from now on she couldntwait to get a chance to talk to him about it after dolores left minerva waited about fifteen minutes and then walked quickly to albus office where they had a long chat about the ministry latest power play he reassured her that no matter how many decrees fudge and umbridge came out with he would not surrender any of his privileges and duties as headmaster dolores would not end up with ultimate power over all life at hogwarts no matter what he had to sacrifice to ensure it minerva believed him but that was what worried her would the ministry hesitate to remove him if they thought he was doing too much to stop them surely the board of governors could be persuaded to sign the order and then she would almost certainly be next on the list hogwarts would be doomed without albus guidance after dinner that night albus wanted to take both of their minds off dolores the minister the educational decrees and anything else that was making the term miserable so he reminded minerva of the quidditch game that afternoon they relived harry chase for the snitch and that last final breathless moment when he caught it and before long minerva was in high spirits again and she agreed to engage in their usual post win celebration unfortunately just as things were heating up the alarms went off signaling that someone was approaching albus office he groaned and let his head drop onto the pillow by minerva shoulder in frustration as she swore loudly getting up and rebuttoning his robes albus said dontmove darling and hold that thought i ll be back soon you better be she yelled after him before rolling over and picking up a book that she couldntseem to focus on while waiting albus did come back a few minutes later prepared to pick up where he left off but minerva could see that he was distracted he spent a few minutes telling her about the reason for the interruption hagrid had returned earlier that night and dolores had already been out to his hut to confront him she had come to say that he was acting very suspicious and she thought albus should let him go albus had dismissed the notion and bade dolores good night as quickly as possible the thought of his lovely wife waiting in bed for him making him want to shove her forcefully out of the office and down the stairs he had been distracted and reminded of his concerns but it hadntdiminished his desire to resume their previous activities and they were able to finish what he started with no further interruptions thankfully harry ron and hermione had actually been in hagrid hut though luckily under the invisibility cloak when umbridge went out to question him they found out that he and madame maxime the headmistress from beauxbatons who was also half giant had gone on a trip to the giants albus wanted to make friends with them and attempt to keep them from joining voldemort in the upcoming war unfortunately the arrival of a couple of death eaters and a rebellion among the giants kept them from accomplishing their goals after umbridge visit harry and his friends had to explain to hagrid what had been going on at hogwarts while he was away hermione tried to make him understand about the high inquisitor and asked him to tame his lesson plans but hagrid didntseem to notice he never thought any creature was too dangerous forgetting that others were not as big and strong as he was not having giant blood the way he did as they had expected umbridge inspected hagrid lesson that tuesday when he was showing them thestrals harry finally had a name for the thing he had seen pulling the carriages on the first day of school and he now understood why he could see them while most of his friends couldn t only someone who had witnessed death could see them since harry had seen cedric die in june he was now able to see the strange skeletal winged horses umbridge of course declared thestrals too dangerous for fifth years and interviewed the slytherins who hated hagrid regarding his teaching skills as they left the forest harry and his friends decided that hagrid prospects for remaining on the hogwarts staff this year did not look good according to sirius umbridge had a problem with anyone who was what she called part human a category hagrid fell into since his mother was a giantess she would be looking for reasons to fire him it had already started snowing by the night hagrid returned and the christmas holidays were fast approaching the d a had one final meeting just before the holidays and harry had them spend the hour reviewing the things they had already covered because he saw no point in starting something new right before a long break he was looking forward to the holidays if only because it would mean no classes with umbridge hermione was going skiing with her parents and ron was going home to the burrow harry had been invited but said that he wanted to stay with his parents for christmas he felt very bad thinking of sirius all alone in his house over the holiday and wished there was some way they could bring him to hogwarts to celebrate with them but that would have been impossible even without umbridge in the castle that night harry had a terrible dream a dream he knew was not a dream but an actual event ron dad was sitting in front of the door that harry had been dreaming about for months and harry was slithering toward him he became aware that he was inside the body of a large snake and then he or rather the snake attacked mr weasley harry scar felt as if it were on fire and he woke to ron shouting his name rolling over harry retched over the side of the mattress causing ron to jump out of the way he was vaguely aware of his other dorm mates anxious voices as he tried to tell ron that his dad was in danger i going for help neville said in a worried voice get mcgonagall ron said quickly guessing that harry would rather see her right now than the nurse neville nodded he had been going to mcgonagall anyway he raced out of the dormitory and down the corridor toward her room knocking loudly and persistently albus and minerva were roused from a deep slumber by the sound and as she tried to get out of bed minerva leg became tangled in the sheets and she fell with an uncharacteristic lack of grace onto the floor damn she swore as she stood back up and then yelled i coming in the general direction of the door grabbing her dressing gown and slippers and shoving her glasses on hastily she turned back to albus who was still attempting to wake up you better go to your office she said quickly i dontknow what this could be but you need to be where someone other than myself could find you i ll come and get you when this is over he nodded and rose to don his dressing gown and slip into his office as minerva rushed to answer the door neville led her back to the dormitory trying to explain what had happened but not really understanding himself all she really got out of it was that harry had woken them all with what appeared to be a nightmare and then he began throwing up she followed him to harry bedside he was covered in a cold sweat and still shaking what is it she asked trying to cover her anxiety harry relayed the story of the dream finishing with it was real i know it was minerva knew he was telling the truth it wasntthe first time he had dreamt about something real i believe you she said looking at him to remind him that she knew about his previous dreams come on we re going to see the headmaster mr weasley you should come with us harry and ron quickly put on their dressing gowns and followed minerva through the corridors to albus office he looked relieved to see her instead of a less welcome visitor and then looked mildly surprised at seeing harry and ron trailing behind her harry told the story of the dream again growing frantic mr weasley was lying bitten and bleeding somewhere they had to help him quickly albus sent one of the previous heads of the school to the ministry of magic to alert someone that arthur needed assistance and another to st mungo to make sure he got there fawkes was sent as a look out and albus consulted one of his many spindly silver instruments that harry had never understood while they waited as soon as the two portraits of the professors came back with their reports albus sent minerva to wake ron brothers and sister and asked yet another of the portraits to carry a message to sirius harry and the weasleys would be coming to stay with him he had also created a portkey out of an old kettle minerva rushed back to gryffindor tower waking the twins first and then ginny mr weasley wake up she said shaking fred shoulder you too she said going to george bed go back to sleep mr jordan she added impatiently when their friend lee jordan awoke and asked what was going on put on your dressing gowns and meet me in the common room both of you i going to get your sister when minerva and ginny descended the stairs from the girls dormitory they found fred and george waiting sleepy and confused in the common room there not much time to explain now but your father has been injured potter saw it in a dream i need you all to come with me to the headmaster office now they arrived back in albus office just as phineas nigellus was leaving for grimmauld place as he was explaining what had happened and where they were going there was a flash of fire and a golden phoenix feather drifted toward the floor it fawkes warning albus said minerva go and head her off tell her any story minerva turned and left the office making her way quickly to the bottom of the stone staircase she encountered dolores umbridge still standing on the bottom stair she leaned casually against the wall arms folded across her chest legs crossed at the ankles effectively blocking passage into the office dolores she said coldly what a surprise to see you here this time of night stand aside minerva dolores said in what she must have believed was an authoritative voice there are students out of bed and i need to know what is going on not everything that occurs at hogwarts is your business dolores minerva replied calmly she puffed herself up it most certainly is as high inquisitor minerva made an angry and derisive sort of noise that title does not give you the right to go snooping into every aspect of life at hogwarts if there are students out of bed of which i am not sure then i sure they will return to bed shortly you know where they are dontyou i have no idea to whom you are referring therefore i do not know where they are minerva said politely dolores looked her over coldly and just what have you been doing in the headmaster office at this hour in your pajamas no less that is most certainly none of your business minerva could tell that dolores was getting frustrated she only hoped she could keep up this circular argument until the children were safely gone i repeat as high inquisitor it is my business to know everything that goes on here if your reason for being in the headmaster office in such attire is anything that could be seen as detrimental to what the ministry is attempting to accomplish then i must make a report trust me when i tell you that my business with albus had nothing to do with the ministry minerva answered coldly a gleam of triumph entered dolores eyes and she smiled that broad i about to get someone in trouble smile you re having an affair with him arentyou i should have known no wonder he allowed you to interfere with my work with potter and fought so hard for the gryffindor quidditch team well this is obviously a case of unfair influence something will have to be done how clever of you dolores minerva said sarcastically no one has ever figured us out before yes i am having an illicit affair with the headmaster didntyou know that how i got my job she dropped the sarcastic tone for an exasperated one really of all the ridiculous accusations cantyou be a bit more original before dolores had a chance to answer albus descended the stairs toward the two women he had sent the five students to grimmauld place as soon as phineas had returned with the message that sirius would be glad to have them ah minerva he said casually i glad i caught up to you there was something i forgot to mention earlier dolores he inclined his head toward her if you will excuse us without waiting for an answer albus and minerva turned and climbed the stairs back to his office leaving a fuming dolores in their wake albus told her that the students were safely at grimmauld place and he had sent fawkes with a message to molly and minerva related her conversation with dolores causing albus to chuckle at her irritation just in case she was still waiting somewhere watching them minerva left the office a few minutes later and walked the long way to their bedroom while albus took the shortcut through his own room harry spent the next two days at grimmauld place with sirius and the weasleys they had a chance to go and visit arthur at the hospital where he was healing well albus and minerva had a difficult time evading dolores questions about the students disappearance the day after they left she was not satisfied that there had been a weasley family emergency she couldntunderstand why that necessitated harry leaving as well and obviously suspected that something else was going on on the twenty third as they were getting ready for bed minerva turned to albus it christmas in two days i dontwant to spend it without harry i know he said softly neither do i which is why i was going to suggest that you go and collect him tomorrow he was rewarded by a wide smile probably minerva first true smile in months as she threw her arms around his neck in thanks the next day just before lunch minerva surprised everyone by showing up at grimmauld place to take harry back to hogwarts unfortunately he had to confine himself to their rooms because his parents did not want dolores to realize they had brought him back it would raise far too many awkward questions all three of them woke with the sun on christmas morning and met in the sitting room for hot chocolate and presents albus had taken photographs of himself and harry and had a lovely muggle style portrait made out of them for minerva to hang in her rooms she was touched by the thoughtfulness of it and immediately hung it in the place of prominence over the mantle so she could see her men whenever she was relaxing or working in the sitting room harry gave her a locket with a tiny picture of himself at two as well as a current one inside it bringing tears to her eyes as he helped her fasten it around her slender neck harry watch had stopped working during the second task of the triwizard tournament the year before when he spent an hour in the lake and the first present he opened was a long overdue replacement for it it was a small replica of albus watch with the stars and moons rotating around it harry loved it but there was one small problem i cantread it he said albus smiled press that button on the side harry did and the face of the watch flipped over to reveal a regular clock with numbers that anyone could understand he looked up at his parents and grinned great idea thanks look on the back minerva suggested he turned it over and saw the inscription we ll always be with you love mum and dad he smiled up at them again from his place on the floor by the christmas tree it was the perfect gift he also got a few fun things including a book about quidditch and a huge box of chocolate frogs next it was albus turn to open the gifts from his family harry had gotten him a large bag of sherbet lemons and an enchanted picture frame containing copies of the photos in minerva locket it was charmed so that only the members of their family could see the real photographs anyone else looking at it would see anonymous strangers that way albus could keep the pictures of harry on the desk in his office when it was her turn to give albus a present minerva took out her wand and flicked it in the direction of the armchair just to the left of the couch they were seated on it turned into a very old and worn purple chintz armchair that had previously occupied the corner of the headmaster bedroom minerva had been most adamant that he not move it into their shared rooms fourteen years ago as it was not very attractive and didntmatch the rest of the furniture he turned to her to ask what it was doing there now she smiled and answered the question before he asked it i should have let you put this chair in here years ago albus these are your rooms too and i want you to be able to be comfortable here i know you have never liked my stuffy wing backed chairs he smiled back it not that i dontlike them my dear they are a reflection of your tastes and personality but they are also much less comfortable than this chair and were designed for someone shorter than myself i afraid i have just never been comfortable in them i know she said apologetically i ve finally decided to overlook the surface of this chair and just focus on what it represents you thank you my dear he said before leaning over to kiss her lightly she had also gotten him a book on chamber music and some robes that he had been eyeing the last time they went to gladrags it had been a relaxing and comforting morning each of them getting gifts that were truly thoughtful and would be comforting in the months ahead when it was time for the christmas lunch minerva stayed behind with harry and summoned a small meal for them from the kitchens while albus went down to the great hall minerva absence was of course questioned and the only explanation he offered was that when he stopped by her rooms to escort her to lunch she told him she didntfeel well and preferred to stay in bed for the afternoon harry enjoyed himself over the holiday even though he couldntgo outside and play in the snow he played many games of chess and gobstones with his parents and read a couple of very interesting books overall just relaxing and enjoying the umbridge free weeks albus and minerva for their part were glad to have harry all to themselves for a short time although albus was spending most of the time in his office and still wouldntalways look harry in the eyes neither albus nor minerva were able to spend as much time with harry as they had hoped because dolores was watching them so closely but they managed to find some family time every day and it helped them all feel rejuvenated and in a better mood by the time term started again in january quill of minerva i agree with you about harry he actually comes off that way in the books sometimes and i think one reason i wanted to write this was to have him behave a bit more maturely some of it i do think depends on who he was raised by and some of it is my wish that he would show more appreciation for minerva and not act so recklessly in reality fluffy white cat i wish you had an email address in your profile so i didnthave to do this publically i have no problem with legitimate criticism and never meant to disrespect you the comment following my reply to you was a general comment venting my frustration over the many reviewers who waste both their time and mine saying ad mm is gross or he too old for her it was not directed at you and thus is why i didntsay it directly after your name i glad you like this story and did not mean to offend anyone chapter 29 getting caught albus had done a lot of thinking over the holidays and he used the first night after harry moved back to the dormitories as an opportunity to discuss things with minerva he was fairly certain that after harry dream about arthur attack voldemort would be aware of their connection and he thought for a moment just before the students left his office that harry looked as if he would like to attack him confirming his earlier fears he had decided that he wanted harry to learn proper occlumency but that it would not be the wisest choice for him to be the teacher could you find the time he asked minerva she looked at him rather skeptically albus you know i ve never been very good at casting the legillimency spell i d rather not know what going on in people minds and you cantperform that spell properly if you dontmean it besides it might not be a good idea for harry to spend very much time outside of class with either of us albus sighed i know i ve thought of all those things myself i suppose i was just hoping i could get around having severus teach him but he really is the best person for the job besides myself harry will not be pleased to have to spend extra time in the dungeons with severus minerva nodded their son had never gotten along with the potions master she wished severus could let go of his schoolboy rivalry with james and stop taking it out on harry but feared that would never happen he had been treating the boy even worse this year probably to impress the mini death eaters among his slytherins until minerva put her foot down and told him in no uncertain terms that he was not to destroy harry work and fail him for no reason however the next day she found herself telling both harry and severus about the occlumency lessons neither of them was pleased now harry had to plan d a meetings around not only quidditch practice but also his extra lessons with snape which he had to call remedial potions he had a very hard time preventing the man from accessing his memories and he always left with his scar burning even though he knew snape was on their side harry couldnthelp wondering if he was actually helping him block his mind against voldemort after his first occlumency lesson harry had his most forceful experience of voldemort emotions he had gone up to the dormitory and suddenly found himself lying on the floor laughing maniacally his scar burning he really happy harry told ron who had snapped him out of the laughter something really good happened they found out what that was the next morning when an article in the daily prophet announced the escape of ten death eaters from azkaban prison the ministry blamed the whole thing on sirius escape two years previously albus and minerva read the article quickly and spent the rest of breakfast discussing the possible outcomes and how the order could get information on the death eaters whereabouts they kept their voices so low that no one else at the table could understand them though they were all fairly certain what they were discussing after they too read the paper minerva could feel dolores glaring at them from the end of the table and it took all of her self control not to turn around and say something rude to her albus was hopeful that with the break out of these death eaters people might be more willing to believe that voldemort activities of fourteen years ago would resume both hagrid and professor trelawney who taught divination were now on probation and umbridge was inspecting all of their classes sybill could often be seen wandering about the corridors talking to herself and smelling suspiciously of cooking sherry as much as minerva disliked the other professor she couldnthelp being concerned about this turn of events for sybill to descend from the north tower into the rest of the school was a rare enough occurrence but the drinking was a true worry to the heads of the school not to mention the fact that even if dolores tried to sack her they had to keep her in the castle she had been the one to make the prophecy sixteen years ago concerning harry and voldemort and albus felt certain that if she were to be found by the death eaters they wouldntwaste a moment before torturing her in an attempt to find out the contents it wouldntmatter to them that a seer very often forgot their true predictions educational decree number twenty six was announced the day after the death eaters escaped from azkaban preventing all teachers from discussing anything with students that was not directly relevant to the course they taught none of the staff could even talk amongst themselves in the staff room anymore and minerva was disgusted to find herself sneaking around talking in hushed whispers to her colleagues in the corridors always looking over their shoulders for dolores the only place she felt comfortable to talk openly was in her rooms with albus and even that time was being cut short this year harry had come to her a couple of times complaining about the way severus treated him during occlumency lessons and the fact that his scar hurt almost constantly now he said he could feel even the slightest change in voldemort emotions and it both horrified and annoyed him minerva had tried so many times over the last four and a half years to get severus and harry to find someway to get along better with each other but she was beginning to give it up as a lost cause all she could do was to remind harry that severus was trying to help him and that it was important for him to practice closing his mind especially at night before he slept try to rid yourself of emotion before you go to bed she said somehow having that advice come from his mum rather than snape made it a bit easier for harry to accomplish the task unfortunately his mutual dislike for the professor made it difficult for harry to free himself of emotion during the actual lessons and the potions master was almost always able to break into his mind he wished he was doing as well at occlumency as neville was doing in the d a for ever since the escape of the death eaters neville had made an almost scary amount of progress working harder than anyone harry was quite proud of him and proud of himself that he had helped neville so much on valentine day there was another hogsmeade weekend harry and cho had made plans to go into the village together but that morning hermione asked harry to meet her at the three broomsticks at noon harry met cho in the entrance hall and they walked into hogsmeade keeping up a friendly and easy conversation cho suggested going into the tea shop which was covered in what harry thought was a rather nauseating display of valentine decorations unfortunately when he brought up the meeting with hermione cho got angry she accused harry of being more interested in hermione than her and didntlisten when he protested and said hermione was just a friend and of course cho was welcome to come with them to the pub he was left sitting alone in the tea shop full of couples and feeling rather stupid but also a bit angry it had been happening slowly all year but it seemed like this might finally be the end of his relationship with cho harry just didntunderstand why she got so upset about little things he wished he could talk to his dad about it but remembered that he wasntsupposed to spend too much time with him this year maybe his mum could explain it shaking off the fight with cho harry went to the three broomsticks early and found hermione waiting for him with rita skeeter the reporter who had written the most disparaging articles about harry and luna lovegood a very strange girl whose father owned a tabloid called the quibbler hermione explained that she wanted harry to give rita an interview about the facts of his encounter with voldemort in june and that luna father would publish it in next month issue after a rocky start and a few threats to make sure rita would report only the facts that harry gave her and not put a negative spin on it he told her the story and she left to write up her article for the quibbler after the breakout from azkaban the talk among the students had seemed to change a bit and more people were looking at harry like he might be telling the truth it seemed that they were less than satisfied with the daily prophet account of things and especially those students who had lost family members at the hands of the now free death eaters were looking for another explanation harry hoped his interview would change some people minds even if it was appearing in a magazine with the reputation of the quibbler next to who knew what kind of rubbish they day the magazine came out harry was sent a free copy by mr lovegood and he received massive amounts of mail from people who had read the interview some of them said they believed him now and others told him he was mad but harry didntcare as long as he could convince some people he was happy he looked toward the staff table but his parents werentlooking at him he wondered what they were thinking unfortunately umbridge had noticed the disturbance caused by all the owls and letters at the gryffindor table and she came down to investigate harry told her about the interview and tossed the quibbler at her she banned him from all future hogsmeade visits and put him in detention for a week but harry didnteven care later that morning educational decree number twenty seven had been put into effect banning the quibbler from hogwarts the students were one step ahead of umbridge however and bewitched the pages of the interview to look like something else if she was inspecting them by that afternoon it was clear that everyone in the school had read it and many of them were starting to treat harry differently the professors were showing their approval of harry behavior by awarding him huge numbers of points for doing little things flitwick gave him a box of sugar mice but the best part was when cho apologized for getting angry about his meeting and told him he was brave for giving the interview she caught up to him on his way to transfiguration on tuesday and gave him a kiss before hurrying off to her next class maybe things werentover between them he thought a few evenings later during harry occlumency lesson with snape they were interrupted by a scream from above both of them rushed upstairs toward the entrance hall and found it packed with students harry pushed his way to the front of the crowd and easily spotted his mum standing directly across from him and looking vaguely sickened by what she was watching sybill trelawney stood in the center of the ring of students clutching her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other her trunks stood on the floor behind her looking as if they had been carelessly tossed down the stairs at the foot of which stood dolores looked completely mad she kept screaming no dolores looked as if she was thoroughly enjoying throwing her out of the school hogwarts is my home sybill protested it was your home dolores sneered attempting to hurry sybill out of the castle albus had found out only moments before it happened that dolores was going to do this he had dashed out to the forest hoping to talk one of the centaurs into temporarily taking over the divination classes i have to replace her before the ministry can he told minerva urgently whatever happens do not let sybill leave the castle minerva had only nodded once as he turned and hurried out of the castle now she stepped forward into the circle and patted sybill on the back offering her a handkerchief telling her she would not have to leave oh really professor mcgonagall dolores said in a threatening voice and you authority for that statement is that would be mine albus declared calmly and loudly from the front doors despite the situation minerva couldnthelp thinking he looked incredibly impressive and handsome standing there framed by the large oak doors with the misty moonlight filtering in behind him if she hadntbeen sitting on a trunk in the midst of everyone at hogwarts with a drunken and sobbing divination teacher in her arms she might not have been able to resist the urge to rush over and kiss him senseless since she was however she just sat with sybill and waited for him to speak again he strode forward through the circle of onlookers and said that it was his wish that sybill remain in the castle and then asked minerva to escort her back to her rooms professor sprout hurried forward to help them up the stairs and flitwick levitated her trunks and followed behind the three women albus then introduced the school to the new divination teacher firenze the centaur it took a while for minerva and sylvia to calm sybill down and convince her to go to bed minerva had to make her promise not to leave hogwarts because she was still protesting that where ever umbridge was she did not want to be the headmaster wishes for you to remain here sybill minerva said sternly giving her the look she saved for unruly students therefore you will stay when she finally managed to leave the north tower minerva walked wearily back to her rooms hoping that albus would already be there he was there and they discussed the night events as they prepared for bed minerva expressed her concern over sybill drinking and albus told her about dolores reaction to firenze she had been most displeased that he had found a replacement before she had a chance and of course the fact that he was part human irked her even more neither of them doubted that hagrid would be the next staff member she would go after and they discussed ways to prepare for it and keep him at hogwarts one night in april when albus and minerva were having a meeting in his office they were interrupted by the arrival of the minister percy weasley and two aurors we have reason to believe that harry potter has been violating school rules all year and i am here to take his statement and see him expelled fudge announce pompously minerva was about to react angrily when albus spoke that is a weighty accusation cornelius do you have proof of this professor umbridge will be here shortly with all the proof we require fudge replied harry had been using the marauder map that fred and george gave him two years ago to check that the coast was clear before entering the room of requirement as well as letting people out of d a meetings tonight he had forgotten to wipe it during the meeting and as he walked around the room checking everyone progress with the patronus charm his eyes caught a great deal of movement in the corridors near them looking more closely he realized that it was umbridge and several slytherin students panicking he sent everyone running hoping they would think to go somewhere besides their common rooms that was closer as harry was running toward the bathroom malfoy hit him with a trip jinx and umbridge cornered him she drug him up to albus office where everyone else was waiting fudge looked at him i expect you know why you are here just as harry was about to say yes he saw his dad shake his head almost imperceptibly and changed his answer no he said innocently the questioning went on in this vein for sometime fudge asking variations of the same question and harry insisting he was unaware of having broken any rules and did not know why he was there finally umbridge went to get their informant who turned out to be cho friend marietta it took a good deal of coaxing from umbridge to get the girl to uncover her face and it was obvious why the word sneak was written across it in purple pustules so that was the curse hermione put on the parchment everyone signed at the first meeting harry thought it was quite good work she covered her face with her robes again very quickly and refused to speak so umbridge told them what marietta had told her that there was to be a meeting in the room of requirement tonight umbridge then brought up harry meeting six months ago stating that he was recruiting students to an illegal defense group at which point albus interrupted to point out that at the time of that meeting the group was not illegal and they had no proof of six months worth of meetings harry heard kingsley shackelbolt one of the aurors the minister had brought who was also an order member whisper a spell just before umbridge turned back to marietta to ask her if she had been attending meetings for the last several months marietta shook her head no so umbridge asked again and again the girl shook her head no getting frustrated with her negative response dolores grabbed marietta and began shaking her for the first time since the meeting started albus looked angry as he jumped to his feet wand out to stop dolores from manhandling the student at this point dolores produced the list of names that hermione had pinned to the wall in the room of requirement during their first meeting their name dumbledore army scrawled quickly at the top when fudge saw that he grew very excited and when he showed it to albus albus confessed he knew that fudge was afraid he was forming an army and he seized the opportunity to keep harry in school knowing he could get himself out of the situation when harry realized what his dad was trying to do he shouted no but received only a warning look from his mum in response fudge began the process of arresting albus but he very calmly stated that he had no intention of going to azkaban so you intend to take on dawlish shackelbolt dolores and myself single handed do you dumbledore fudge asked with a sneer he will not be single handed minerva said loudly reaching for her wand oh yes he will minerva albus said quickly hogwarts needs you he shared a quick look with her and she suddenly knew what he was planning it all happened very quickly with a flash of silver and a brief struggle the moment albus acted minerva reached over and pushed both harry and marietta to the floor as soon as the office was silent again albus walked over to them and minerva dragged the students back up they spoke briefly there wasntmuch time before the others would awaken and albus needed to leave he wanted very badly to kiss minerva before he left but with marietta standing there looking on it was not advisable and he could hardly justify modifying her memory for a second time that night over something as personal as a kiss he reminded harry to practice occlumency and then both albus and fawkes disappeared in a flash of flame just before the ministry workers awoke minerva acted as if no time had passed and she had no idea where albus had gone before taking harry and marietta out of the office they walked marietta to the ravenclaw common room and when they drew near gryffindor tower minerva steered harry into her rooms i so sorry he said as soon as the door closed looking miserable where did he go i not sure minerva admitted and harry could hear the worry in her voice she sat down on the couch staring up at the portrait above the mantle and harry had never felt so guilty in his life as he did at that moment he didntknow what to do or say slowly he crossed to sit beside her and drew her into a hug suddenly remembering the few times during his childhood when his dad had left for a few days and he had tried to cheer up his mum i sure he ll be alright harry said dad can take care of himself i know was the only answer a few minutes went by and minerva spoke again harry keeping that group going after the decree was very foolish he started to apologize again but didntget the words out before she continued it made your father very proud he was hoping you wouldntget found out do you understand why he did what he did tonight yes harry nodded he didntwant me to get expelled i know i need to learn all the magic i can i going to have to fight voldemort again arenti minerva looked at him sadly and decided that now was not the time to share what she knew i dontknow harry but it does seem likely doesntit he nodded and after a few more minutes minerva surprised him by rising from the couch and going to her desk she took out a small round mirror and said he should be there by now then she spoke directly into the mirror albus dumbledore when she rejoined him on the couch harry was amazed to see the surface of the mirror ripple slightly before his dad face appeared i alright he said how are the two of you we re fine minerva brushed off the question where are you i d rather not say just now but i promise i ll be careful he said before she could warn him harry albus said do not attempt anymore of those meetings you cannot do anything from here out to draw suspicion on yourself do you understand yes harry answered i so sorry dad i never thought you would be forced to leave hogwarts because of this it was my choice to leave harry because you needed to stay dontworry i ll be back sooner than they think albus face turned away from them for a moment i have to go now i ll try to contact you again soon good bye minerva whispered and be careful the image in the mirror rippled again and albus was gone it late minerva said suddenly we should try to get some sleep harry nodded can i stay with you his reason for asking was two fold he suddenly felt very young again and wanted to be near his mum but he also felt she might need him tonight minerva agreed and harry went into his room but after lying awake for a while he went and crawled into the large four poster bed with minerva where he finally slept though not peacefully his last conscious thought was that part of this was cho fault she had been the one to bring marietta to the d a after all he suddenly never wanted to speak to her again a n in my last chapter i neglected to thank my good pal christy for her help thanks pal i love ya miss mione i sad it almost over too but i have a related project in mind so keep an eye out for that later as for the last chapters of the book you ll just have to keep reading wontyou chapter 30 a battle of wills by the next morning signs had gone up all over the school declaring dolores umbridge the new headmistress of hogwarts to no one surprise she had also tapped several slytherin students including draco malfoy and his cronies to an inquisitorial squad harry and his friends found out the hard way that they were able to take points every house but slytherin was rapidly losing every stone in their hour glass just before lunch harry was summoned to dolores office where she offered him tea that he did not drink and questioned him about the whereabouts of both his father and sirius just as harry was insisting that he didntknow where they were there was a huge boom from the first floor harry had run into fred and george before his meeting with umbridge and he had a very good idea that they were the ones responsible for the commotion rushing out of the office after umbridge harry was witness to the most spectacular fireworks display he had ever seen the enormous multicolored dragons and catherine wheels refused to be either stunned or vanished the ensuing chaos was incredible minerva had rushed out of the great hall along with the rest of the staff and the students when they heard the disturbance and she looked on with grim amusement as dolores battled the fireworks the rest of the staff taking their cue from her did nothing to attempt to help the new headmistress dolores spent the rest of the day rushing about the school dealing with the disturbance harry and cho officially broke up the next evening she stopped him on his way to occlumency lessons with snape and actually stood up for marietta and said that hermione jinx had been a mean trick harry stuck up for hermione and cho bit his head off he decided he d had enough you know i dontthink this is working out anymore he said trying very hard to reign in his anger things have been going wrong ever since we came back in september and quite honestly i ve got too many other things to cope with to spend time wondering why you re always mad at me fine cho said angrily go and cope with it then maybe hermione will help you she turned and stalked off and harry stomped down to the dungeons for his lesson with snape not exactly in the mood to spend an hour with the man who had been his least favorite professor before umbridge appeared his only consolation was that he had been able to practice most nights before sleeping and hadnthad another voldemort related dream in a while near the end of the easter holidays a sign appeared in the common room stating that all fifth years were required to meet with their head of house regarding their career plans and future course work the table under the bulletin board was covered with pamphlets describing various careers and the exam scores necessary to be selected for them harry scanned the list of appointment times and found that he was to be in his mum office at half past two on monday when he got there harry was not pleased to find umbridge sitting in the office with her clipboard harry took a seat across from his mum and tried to ignore umbridge he could tell her presence was greatly irritating his mum and he didntblame her minerva began the meeting attempting to pretend dolores was not there she asked harry if he had thought about a career only just realizing that she had never bothered to discuss careers with him before and suddenly feeling like she had failed somehow as a mother harry didntseem to notice however as he replied that he would like to become an auror minerva ignored all of dolores attempts to interrupt them as she began telling harry what courses he would need to take in sixth and seventh years and what o w l scores were required to enroll in those courses finally she could stand the false coughing no longer and without looking at the woman asked curtly may i offer you a cough drop dolores dolores declined the cough drop and asked if she could interrupt them to which minerva very desperately wanted to reply that she already had instead she let her speak and dolores questioned whether harry had the temperament for an auror minerva ignored her question and began addressing harry again most of his grades with the exception of potions had been good enough so far that he was likely to achieve the required o w l results when they got around to his defense against the dark arts scores dolores interrupted again to explain that his performance in her class had not been satisfactory i should have made my meaning plainer minerva said finally looking dolores in the eyes he has achieved high marks in all defense against the dark arts tests set by a competent teacher dolores sickeningly sweet smile vanished immediately as she began scribbling furiously on her parchment no doubt making notes about minerva insubordination to report to the minister harry then asked what other kinds of tests the ministry put hopeful aurors through and dolores interrupted once again to say that harry did not have the kind of character required and that the ministry would never hire him as an auror there may well be a new minister of magic by the time potter is ready to join minerva shouted at that point dolores accused her of wanting albus to become the minister so that she would be in dolores position you are raving was minerva response before sending harry out of the office he could hear them yelling at each other all the way down the corridor not only do i have no desire to ever be in your position dolores minerva said disdainfully but i think that it is you who desire what i have i cantimagine what you re talking about dolores said fiercely minerva sniffed well i am quite skilled at what i do i enjoy a position of seniority and respect at hogwarts respect that has been earned through my actions and not by bullying everyone into fearing me i might add and i work for a man who views me as a person and a valuable colleague rather than a useful pawn dolores laughed harshly i hardly think so minerva oh minerva asked so you believe then that the minister respects you for your capabilities and holds you in high regard he made me high inquisitor and headmistress didnthe dolores shouted you are here dolores minerva said with the air of explaining to a toddler that two plus two equals four because the minister knows that by giving you a small amount of imagined authority you will do anything he wants you to no one here respects you most donteven fear you as you would like them to there are times when i could almost feel sorry for you almost dolores puffed herself up well minerva i think you have made it more than apparent where your loyalties lie i will be informing the minister of the accusations you have made of your lack of respect for your superior and your overall unhelpful attitude since i became headmistress rest assured that this is not over good minerva replied you tell your precious minister exactly what i said i only recognize one head of this school and it never has been and never will be you no matter how many educational decrees you force on us rest assured that albus dumbledore will be back in his office before the end of the school year dolores did not respond instead she made another note on her clip board and stormed out of the office for her next class minerva sank back into her chair and suppressed a scream of frustration it had probably not been wise to say those things to dolores but she no longer cared at this point and she seriously doubted that she had given the ministry grounds to sack her she was still doing an excellent job of teaching and it would be very difficult to find a legitimate reason to throw her out fred and george weasley seemed to have taken it upon themselves to cause as much trouble for dolores umbridge as possible now that albus was gone because that afternoon they unleashed a miniature swamp in the fifth floor corridor they were cornered by the inquisitorial squad and harry entered the entrance hall that evening to find a scene very much like the night trelawney had been sacked with the twins in the center of the circle this time filch came wheezing and hobbling up to dolores waving a piece of parchment harry had a sick feeling that it was the order for reinstating the old punishments like whipping that the caretaker had mentioned the day he took harry to umbridge office after his dad left minerva stood once again in the front row of onlookers her stomach in knots as she thought about what dolores was likely to do to the twins as much as those two had tested her patience over the years minerva did like them they were decent kids deep down and had been a real asset to gryffindor during their seven years she didntwant to see anything happen to them to her surprise and relief just as dolores was about to announce their punishment fred and george summoned their brooms and took off they announced that they had opened a shop called weasley wizarding wheezes in diagon alley and asked peeves to give her hell from us before flying out the large oak doors into the sunset minerva stood there stunned listening to the cheers and applause from the rest of the student body nothing like that had ever been seen in hogwarts history and while she was a bit disappointed they werentgoing to take their n e w t s she felt a small surge of pride at their obvious capabilities and the way they had stood up for albus then she cringed thinking of all the students that would no doubt be trying to take over the title of mischief maker supreme as she had predicted a great number of the students began dropping dungbombs and stink pellets all over the school so many that filch couldntpossibly catch them all even better was the fact that dolores was unable to clear away the swamp the twins had left and though she could have easily cleaned it up minerva stayed away from the spot and left her to deal with it on her own the rest of the staff once again following her example someone had managed to put a niffler in umbridge office and it did a tremendous amount of damage even attacked her when she came in peeves had truly taken fred parting words seriously and began causing five times as much mayhem as usual harry saw him trying to loosen a chandelier one day and witnessed his mum telling the poltergeist that it unscrewed the other way filch was the only one in the castle who even made an effort to help dolores and that was only because she had given him the authority to institute the kinds of punishments that albus had long been denying him fred and george had left their mark in other ways as well the skiving snack boxes they had been working on all year had apparently sold well as every time dolores entered her classroom various students would suddenly develop fevers and nosebleeds or would begin vomiting and fainting there was nothing she could do about it but allow them to leave the classroom as no one would tell her the real cause of their ailments the gryffindor quidditch team had to replace them quickly before the last game of the year the best they could do were two boys named sloper and kirke they werentvery good but at least they had beaters the last quidditch game of the season took place on the last saturday in may and ron was in very poor spirits the morning of the game he still wasntperforming very well as keeper and he was miserable about it somehow though that day he managed to play better than he had all season and gryffindor won the cup by the end of the game everyone from gryffindor ravenclaw and hufflepuff were singing a whole new version of malfoy song weasley is our king this version praising ron he had never felt better in his life it was possibly the first time he had been recognized for something that had nothing to do with either harry or his older brothers harry was very proud of his best friend and thought that maybe fred and george absence had given him a bit more confidence they hadntexactly been encouraging of their younger brother when he joined the team for a little while that day everything felt like it was back to normal and everyone spirits were high even minerva s her lions had won the quidditch cup for the second time in two seasons and she felt good the only thing that took away from her enjoyment of the day was her husband absence they had communicated by mirror again a few times and she had received an occasional letter via fawkes to which she responded by telling albus about everything that had been going on at the school his letters never gave her very much information about where he was or what he was doing and she could only hope he was being careful and keeping himself safe she wished she could help him but even worse she missed him terribly she couldntremember ever spending so much time apart from him even before they were married and spent most of her evenings sitting in his newly relocated armchair wishing he was there with her o w l s and n e w t s started mid way through june and for the two weeks before hand it was all the fifth and seventh years could think about the first week harry had charms transfiguration herbology and defense against the dark arts all of which he thought he did well in but he felt especially good about defense against the dark arts it had been particularly satisfying to perform all of the counter jinxes perfectly right under umbridge nose as she watched from the doors harry felt good about transfiguration as well and couldnthelp giving his mum a wink and a small smile as he passed her on his way out the door she smiled back quickly and nodded her head at him as he left minerva had watched harry more closely than most of her students and she was pleased with his success he hadntperformed perfectly but certainly at least well enough to achieve an exceeds expectations he had friday off and then the next week started with potions followed by care of magical creatures and astronomy on wednesday harry had found it much easier to make the potions in the great hall where it was bright and sunny and snape was standing by the door rather than breathing down his neck it wasntmuch different than practicing with his mum over the summer and he noticed that neville who also had a very hard time in snape classes looked much more relaxed as well they had the theory portion of the astronomy exam on wednesday morning and then had to wait for nightfall for the practical harry and hermione had arithmancy that afternoon while ron sat his divination exam at eleven o clock that night they climbed up to the astronomy tower and were given telescopes and star charts to fill out after about an hour harry noticed the front doors of the castle opening directly below him and a beam of light spilled across the dark lawns glancing down again he could see several shadows moving across the grounds toward hagrid hut he tried to continue with his exam but was distracted by the distant sound of knocking followed by a dog barking a few minutes later there was a sound almost like a roar that drew the attention of several students suddenly with a loud bang the door to hagrid hut burst open and he emerged followed by several other figures who seemed to be trying to stun him as hagrid yelled and fought back parvati patil drew everyone attention to the front doors which had opened again and a single shadow could be seen moving across the lawn a moment later a very angry voice floated up to the top of the tower as the figure began running how dare you she was shouting harry didntneed hermione whisper to know it was his mum he had completely forgotten that he was in the middle of an exam as he watched the scene playing out on the front lawn his heart thumping madly in his chest leave him alone minerva was shouting on what grounds are you attacking him he has done nothing nothing to warrant such she never got to finish as four beams of red light shot from the wands of the people surrounding hagrid cabin and hit her squarely in the chest minerva was lifted off her feet glowing red for a moment before she fell to the ground completely still harry forgot himself entirely muuuuum he yelled noooo ignoring the confused looks and murmurings of everyone else harry thrust his star chart at professor tofty and took off at a dead run from the tower barreling down the stairs and through the corridors taking every shortcut he knew he arrived in the entrance hall just in time to see madam pomfrey levitating his mum through the front doors he rushed toward them is she going to be okay he asked frantically poppy along with most of the hogwarts staff had of course by this point realized harry connection to albus and minerva so she didnteven question why he wasntstill doing his exam i dontknow she told him gravely as she set off for the hospital wing minerva floating lifelessly in front of her on a stretcher harry followed along behind her more scared than he could ever remember being in his life possibly even more so than when he had faced down voldemort in the graveyard a year ago his mum couldntdie she just couldn t he felt tears stinging the backs of his eyes at the very thought and worked hard to force them back crying wouldnthelp anything just now he stayed by her side in the hospital wing as madam pomfrey examined and attempted to enervate minerva the stunners had done a lot of damage and she could only hope to stabilize her enough to be able to transport her to st mungo s after what felt like an eternity to harry minerva eyes fluttered halfway open he leaned over her mum can you hear me you re going to be alright he could hear the tears in his own voice and tried to be brave for her madam pomfrey says they re going to take you to st mungo in the morning you have to get better harry had been holding her hand and minerva squeezed it weakly as she tried to reassure him i ll be alright she took a painful shuddering breath contact your father tell him another raspy breath be careful harry she closed her eyes again and made another attempt to squeeze his hand before she lost consciousness again harry sat there for a while longer until he realized that his dad needed to be told what had happened he squeezed his mum hand and kissed her cheek whispering please get better before leaving the hospital wing to go to her rooms harry found the mirror in her desk drawer and said albus dumbledore after a moment his father appeared harry what is it what happened albus knew that if harry was contacting him at almost three in the morning something very serious must have happened it mum harry started trying to hold off his tears long enough to tell the story she got attacked tonight umbridge and some other people were attacking hagrid apparently trying to sack him like she did trelawney and mum rushed out to stop them they hit her with four stunners his voice broke she in the hospital wing now but madam pomfrey says they ll have to take her to st mungo in the morning as he had been telling the story harry saw the anger creep into his father face he had only seen him that angry twice before and frankly it scared him a bit he wasntsure what to expect albus seethed for a few moments how dare they have the audacity to attack minerva and for no good reason not that there would have been a good reason for attacking her then he forced himself to speak calmly to harry listen to me harry you have two weeks left in the castle and there no guarantee when either your mother or i will be back you need to tread especially carefully from now on dolores will be watching you and you must not do anything even remotely suspicious harry nodded do you know about her inquisitorial squad yes albus said gravely your mother has been keeping me updated on everything that gone on at hogwarts since i left draco and his friends as you well know will try to provoke you at every opportunity do not rise to the bait if they take four hundred points from gryffindor just brush it off and walk away do you understand yes sir harry said seriously i promise i wontdo anything to cause a problem i dontwant you worrying about me now how will we get news from st mungo about mum it had only just occurred to him that the healers wouldntknow to give harry any information and couldnthave found his dad even if they did think to tell him i imagine madam pomfrey will be in contact with them you can check with her but i may try to visit no harry said sharply you ll be caught he added a bit apologetically albus looked at him with something akin to amusement i think i can get past the night shift healers it late you should try to sleep now dontyou have more exams tomorrow yes harry said sullenly but how am i going to concentrate on them after this i know it difficult harry but you must try go to bed now you can contact me again tomorrow night if you wish harry nodded again alright i will good night dad good night harry albus said i love you please be careful i will and i love you too harry said before albus faded away again he couldntbring himself to go back to the dormitory so he walked into his parents room suddenly feeling very tired and collapsed onto their large bed it was warm and comforting and harry thought he could detect a faint scent of lemons and lavender on the pillows it was the potpourri of his parents and somehow it soothed him to sleep more quickly than he would have thought possible he was so tired and so worried about his mum that he completely forgot to empty his mind before sleeping chapter 31 homecomings harry slept until afternoon the next day and missed most of his history of magic o w l and when he awoke it was from a disturbing dream he had forgotten to empty his mind the night before and so voldemort had been able to plant images in harry mind he walked quickly down the now familiar corridor toward the closed door and finally reached it the door opened and harry passed through a second door into a room filled with glittering light and a soft ticking sound through that room he entered a third room filled with rows and rows of high shelves holding many glass spheres practically running harry made his way to row ninety seven and turned left hurrying down the aisle there was a shadowy figure crouching at the end of the row harry couldnttell who it was but he began to speak to the figure in a high cold voice telling it to reach up and take down one of the spheres for him you ll have to kill me sirius said harry raised his wand and said crucio just before he woke up screaming he woke up screaming and panting almost falling off the edge of the bed and searched frantically for the mirror voldemort had sirius somewhere wait that couldntbe right sirius never left his house and no death eater could get into the house harry realized that this must have been what his parents had warned him about voldemort was planting images in his mind but why where had he been what did voldemort want he sat there breathing hard and thinking for a few minutes trying to piece it all together there was a prophecy voldemort knew about the prophecy and he wanted it in the dream he had been trying to get sirius to take one of those glass spheres off the shelf for him that it it was the hall of prophecies he must have been in the ministry of magic harry found the mirror and called out his dad name if voldemort was laying a trap for harry at the ministry maybe he was there or his death eaters were albus looked surprised to see harry again what is it what happened he asked almost frantically i just had another one of those dreams harry told him i know i supposed to be blocking my mind but i guess i forgot last night after everything that happened i think voldemort was trying to get me to go somewhere is there a big room somewhere full of shelves of glass balls is that where the prophecies are kept a bit surprised at the ease with which harry had pieced it together having never seen the ministry or been told about the department of mysteries albus told him he was correct i think he wanted me to go there do you think it a trap maybe he there harry suggested albus thought that his son was probably right there were likely to at least be several death eaters lying in wait for harry at the department of mysteries he would have to act quickly harry listen to me he said urgently no matter what happens do not leave hogwarts donteven go outside i going to contact the order and we ll take care of this keep this mirror with you and use it if you need me but not in front of anyone go and finish your exams they re over harry admitted i slept through history of magic er sorry albus waved it off that alright you dontneed to take that anymore to be an auror take the mirror and go join the rest of the school close your mind to voldemort and no matter what happens do not say or do anything foolish i have to go alright harry said as his dad faded away he was a bit surprised that he already knew of his ambitions to be an auror and then remembered that his parents had been talking over the past weeks it was nice to know they d had time to talk about harry and his career counseling session he didntfeel much like facing the rest of the school and he assumed that his mum would already be gone to st mungo so there was no reason to go to the hospital wing lying back down harry clutched a pillow in his arms and tried to empty his mind whatever was going to happen he didntwant to witness it meanwhile albus had rushed off to grimmauld place where he found sirius remus lupin tonks mad eye moody and kingsley shackelbolt he told them what harry had seen and they all agreed that there were likely to be death eaters lying in wait for him at the ministry making a quick plan albus asked sirius to remain behind but he refused he had been cooped up for too all set out for the ministry having contacted arthur weasley and a few other members who were inside the building and telling them to keep an eye out for unusual activity within a few hours it was over the order members had found the death eaters and while auror backup was called and the minister contacted there was a fierce duel between the death eaters and the six order members in which moody lost his magical eye tonks was injured badly enough to require taking her to st mungo and sirius was killed by his cousin bellatrix lestrange albus had been checking the rest of the department of mysteries for voldemort and when he entered the death chamber where the duel was going on he was able to bind eleven of the death eaters and put an anti apparition jinx on them before going back to the atrium voldemort had been very angry that his plan had not succeeded and he made the folly of coming to the ministry himself albus dueled with him almost lazily always staying one step ahead of his enemy until voldemort fired a death curse at him fawkes appeared out of nowhere and put himself in front of the green jet of light falling to the floor as a tiny featherless mass crooning a weak note the minister and the rest of the aurors showed up just as voldemort was leaving with bellatrix lestrange but in time to see him for a moment fudge still attempted to have albus arrested until he pointed out that proof had at last been given that he had been speaking the truth for a year and there were several death eaters downstairs in the department of mysteries he stayed for half an hour to explain things to the minister and then dropped by st mungo to check on minerva before going back to the school poppy had managed to stabilize minerva enough with several potions that she was safely transported to the hospital in london that morning where she drifted in and out of consciousness all day as various healers ran diagnostics and tried to assess the amount of damage it was late when albus arrived and she was sleeping but when he sat down next to her and took her small hand within his own she woke and turned to look at him albus she said in a weak small voice you cantbe here you ll be caught it alright my dear he smiled at her everything has been cleared up i am no longer a fugitive and fudge has seen proof of voldemort return with his own eyes what what happened he told her the story of everything that had happened since she was attacked the night before and she gasped in horror before squeezing his hand tightly tears welling up in her eyes i so glad you re alright is everyone else okay albus looked uncomfortable most of them will be i believe tonks is probably here somewhere by now she was injured rather severely during the duel and we lost sirius at that news minerva started to cry in earnest sirius she whispered as if willing it to be untrue i know albus said gently kissing her forehead lightly but he died in battle it was the way he would have wanted it he wasntcut out for sitting around inside while others faced all the danger sirius was a gryffindor to the core and he was prepared to die for our cause we will all miss him but we have to remember his noble sacrifice minerva could only nod how many more of her gryffindors would be lost to this battle albus sat with her until she could no longer keep her eyes open anymore and drifted off to sleep again she would recover but it would take some time until she was in top form again he left her quietly with a soft kiss on the cheek and went back to hogwarts it was time to depose dolores umbridge from her reign of terror over the school and he had much to explain to the students harry especially meanwhile at hogwarts ron and hermione were worried about harry they hadntseen him since the astronomy exam last night and didntknow where to begin looking for him the news of his outburst and sudden departure had spread quickly through the school that day and everyone was most curious about what he meant by yelling mum as mcgonagall was attacked only ron hermione and ginny knew the truth and they werenttalking all three of them refused to answer any questions on that matter claiming they had no idea what he meant they did wonder how harry and his parents would deal with his inadvertent revelation there had been children of death eaters in the tower the night before and word was certain to get back to their fathers about what had happened harry still didntrealize what he d said albus returned to his office via the floo network and decided that the first thing he needed to do was talk to harry he had managed to convince the ministry to destroy the record of the prophecy explaining that voldemort would not rest until he heard it which meant that they could expect future break ins because only the people to whom a prophecy refer can lift them off the shelves in the process he decided that it was time for harry to know what the prophecy said even though he hated to tell him harry was sure to be curious and albus decided that minerva was right he should have told him years ago when he arrived back at the school he was greeted warmly by the portraits of the old heads of the school and then quickly passed into the rooms he shared with minerva somehow he had a feeling that where harry would be he found the boy asleep in the overstuffed chintz chair in the sitting room with minerva tartan bathrobe draped over himself like a blanket harry wake up albus send gently shaking harry by the shoulder he awoke slowly mumbling hmm dad what are you doing here albus took a seat on the couch and began to explain everything that had happened since harry contacted him earlier that afternoon telling him about sirius death had been the hardest part harry had barely gotten to know sirius over the last two years but had been growing to think of the man like an older brother and now one more person he cared about had been ripped from his life sirius had been one of harry few links to his real parents and losing him had been sort of like losing them all over again only this time harry was old enough to understand once harry had pulled himself together a bit albus continued i know this isntthe best time for it but you need to know what the prophecy said that voldemort was so anxious to hear do you want me to tell you now or wait until summer i d like to know now if that alright harry said albus nodded and went back to his office to get his penseive upon his return he explained sixteen years ago i went to the hogshead to meet with professor trelawney for an interview for the divination post i wasntreally inclined to keep the course but met with her out of courtesy i need hardly tell you that your mother was less than enthusiastic about the idea the two men shared a knowing grin before albus continued his story however when i met with sybill she made a true prediction as i told you before one of voldemort supporters was able to hear the beginning before he was discovered and thrown out by your uncle tonight i convinced the ministry to destroy the record because voldemort would have continued trying to either lure you to the hall of records or to break in himself to retrieve it the only record that now exists is my own memory of the prophecy albus put his wand to his temple and withdrew a shimmering silver strand of thought prodding the surface of the liquid in the penseive with his wand he and harry both watched as a ghostly figure of sybill trelawney rose out of it and began to speak the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies there was ringing silence in the room when she finished and sank back into the liquid in the penseive harry just stared at the place where the image had been while albus watched him harry questioned whether it had to mean him and albus did admit that neville longbottom fit the first two criteria born at the end of july to parents who had three times avoided voldemort but it was only harry who fit the last he had been marked when voldemort chose to attack him rather than neville almost fifteen years ago there was no question that the prophecy was about harry but i haventgot any powers voldemort doesn t harry protested there is a room in the department of mysteries that is kept locked at all times harry albus explained it contains a most mysterious force that is at once wonderful and terrible the power in that room is what you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has none at all that will be your weapon against him harry tried to take that in he felt vaguely like he was experiencing this from outside his own body somehow he had always known that voldemort would continue to haunt him until he was defeated but to know that he would be the one to do it was a bit overwhelming harry thought back to the night his father had left hogwarts he had been right about having to fight again does mum know this he asked suddenly albus nodded gravely yes harry but i not entirely sure she has completely accepted it yet you must understand how hard it is for her and for myself to think that this is your future if there was any way i could spare you from having to face this i would i have tried very hard to spare you from even the knowledge of this prophecy so that you could have a normal childhood but i think you are both old enough and mature enough to understand now harry nodded absently that bit at the end about neither can live while the other survives does that mean one of us has to kill the other in the end yes albus said quietly with obvious pain in his eyes harry spent most of friday and saturday trying to avoid the rest of the school he had a lot on his mind and didntfeel like facing other people he was mourning for sirius worrying about his mum recovery and pondering the prophecy on sunday an article ran in the daily prophet announcing voldemort return they includedharry interview from the quibbler in march he couldntbe bothered to read the whole thing that afternoon harry thought he might go outside and sit by the lake for a while unfortunately he ran into malfoy crabbe and goyle in the entrance hall all three of their fathers were death eaters and had been arrested on thursday night malfoy seemed to have decided that it was harry fault or at least that harry would make a good target for his anger just as they drew their wands on each other snape turned up and attempted to dock points from gryffindor unfortunately the hourglass was completely empty but before he could announce harry substitute punishment minerva entered the school drawing their attention she was leaning heavily on a walking stick but looked quite well otherwise harry immediately felt a huge part of the weight that had been pressing on him since wednesday lift as snape greeted her harry rushed over and took her carpet bag and cloak from her welcome back professor he said smiling at her can i help you with your things professor sneered malfoy dontyou mean mum he made a face that harry assumed was supposed to be an imitation of himself wednesday night followed closely by sucking up noises crabbe and goyle laughing sycophantically in the background minerva gave harry a funny look when malfoy said that but he just led the way out of the entrance hall she walked much slower than normal due to the walking stick or whatever injury it was that made her dependent upon it and for the first time in his life harry slowed rather than quickened his pace to keep stride with his mum they didntspeak as he led the way to the stone gargoyle that guarded the headmaster office fizzing wizbee harry said and they both stepped onto the movie staircase letting themselves into the circular office at the top harry barely had time to set down minerva things before she pulled him into a tight embrace he returned the hug gingerly not wanting to hurt her when it appeared that she wasntgoing to let him go anytime soon harry said mum and albus cleared his throat from the other side of the room minerva looked up and laughed softly through her tears she was so glad to be back with both of them and so relieved they were both alright she took one arm off harry and reached out to albus who stepped over and wrapped his arms around her waist as harry slipped away from her gently after a tender kiss albus chuckled and said we re very glad to have you back as well my dear minerva laughed at her own uncharacteristic display of emotions and stepped back i so glad you re both alright she said then turning to harry she asked what was mr malfoy talking about downstairs it took him a minute to remember what malfoy had said and then another few moments to realize what he meant looking quite sheepish harry explained er well the night you were attacked i think that is everyone says that i screamed mum no from the top of the astronomy tower before i took off running downstairs i wasnteven aware i had done it sorry they all thought about it for a minute and minerva said well i suppose they were all bound to find out at some point but perhaps if we ignore it they ll forget have you answered any questions about it no i ve been pretty much avoiding everyone for the last few days she nodded thoughtfully and looked at albus to see what he thought but he was just staring at her and looked as though he hadntheard a word of her conversation with harry albus she called no answer albus he shook himself hmm oh i sorry my dear i just so glad you re back and you re alright you really scared us you know i dontknow what we would do with out you minerva blushed slightly and harry grinned and said i ll leave you two alone for a while it really good to have you back mum he let her hug him briefly one more time before slipping away as soon as he was gone albus helped minerva over to the couch and sat down pulling her legs across his lap they sat that way for a very long time exchanging loving kisses and tender words about how much they had missed each other it would be a few more days before they could even think about celebrating their reunion the way they had both been longing to ever since albus had been driven out of the school but for now they were just glad to be together again dolores umbridge had been officially stripped of her powers as high inquisitor and of course headmistress and had been released from the hogwarts staff following albus reinstatement as headmaster to everyone relief she tried to slip out during dinner the night before the end of term evidently hoping to avoid a scene because her dismissal had been met with so much enthusiasm unfortunately for her peeves saw her headed for the entrance hall and he quickly raced ahead grabbing up a sack of chalk and asking minerva to borrow her walking stick he chased umbridge out of the school and down the front walkway wacking her over the head with each in turn a good number of students ran out cheering after her and none of the staff really tried to stop them minerva half stood from her chair at the head table and called weakly and half heartedly gryffindors stay at your table stop come back she had no true intention for her students to either hear or heed her words and quickly sat back down again saying a bit more loudly to albus actually i would like to join them unfortunately peeves borrowed my walking stick she was quite possibly the most happy to see umbridge leave but certainly no one was sad to see her go not after the way she had bullied them all everyone was in high spirits at the leaving feast the next day because it was the first umbridge free day of the school year however their enjoyment of the evening was hampered a bit by the fact that they were all now certain that voldemort had risen again and by the fact that slytherin had won the house cup thanks to the inquisitorial squad none of the other houses had anywhere near enough points to compete with slytherin for the second year in a row harry did not take the train back to king cross albus and minerva were nervous about letting him go off alone now that voldemort had failed in his attempts to get the prophecy and had lost several of his most trusted followers also minerva wasntin good enough shape yet to go and pick him up in london and it just seemed like too much trouble to go through for the sake of appearances instead the three of them retreated to their rooms right after the rest of the students left and spent the day quietly enjoying each other company both albus and harry spent the day trying to make sure minerva stayed off her feet as much as possible the healers had warned her to rest a lot for the next few weeks and it was making her crazy she spent the day arguing with them about it and attempting to spoil both of her men she was so happy to have them back again a n here is where i leave you until i have had a chance to read re read and more than likely read again hbp and determine what could go over differently i have to thank all my reviewers you made this project worth doing and my pal who stuck with me from the very beginning when this was just a half formed idea i hope you ll all catch back up with me whenever the next book happens to come out and i continue in the meantime look for harry potter and what might have been the deleted scenes i going to post a series of short scenes that i thought up but either didnthave room for or didntknow where to put mostly just cute little cookies i think chapter 46 the unused horcrux in the weeks following the quidditch match albus and harry spent hours pouring over harry notes in addition to the newspaper articles and the few details they knew of tom riddle life both before and after he became lord voldemort albus could find nothing intellectually wrong with harry ideas but something told him they were looking down the wrong path he tried to open his mind almost certain that they were right under his nose if only he could get his thoughts in the proper order you ve told me several times how much voldemort liked hogwarts harry said one night how he seemed drawn to it d you think he might have left one of the horcruxes hidden here somewhere in the chamber of secrets perhaps or in the room of requirement it could become anything he wanted and without knowing the proper thing to ask it for no one else could get into the same space harry knew this from his experience with draco the previous year he could have counted on it remaining hidden there forever or on the curse taking care of anyone who found it by accident albus thought for a long moment before answering harry his long fingers tented in a familiar gesture of concentration that possible he agreed however before we go tearing up the school or trying to enter the chamber i think we should exhaust all other possibilities dontforget the effect it would have on your fellow students if word got around that voldemort had left a piece of his soul hidden somewhere in this castle harry began pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace albus himself often traveled across the well worn carpet in much the same manner and recognized it as an excellent way to focus one thinking minutes passed unheeded as both father and son found themselves deep in thought finally harry sat down again wearily perhaps we should call it a night albus suggested a good night sleep may be the best solution to our current troubles all right harry agreed reluctantly hang on do you remember what you told me last year about the night voldemort came to kill me and failed you said that he probably would have planned to make the final horcrux that night and that since he failed you believe he used the snake nagini more recently to complete the set of six albus nodded yes i remember do you now find fault with my logic no of course not but if voldemort were going to make a horcrux the night he attacked my parents and myself wouldnthe have had to take it with him what if he left something there that night it would be valuable but completely useless to him or to us shouldntwe make sure we re not searching around for some forgotten item what happened to the house i remember the news articles saying it was mostly destroyed but no one ever said what happened after that was it torn down rebuilt is the rubble still there harry eyes gleamed with a fresh excitement as his mind slowly unraveled the possibility that one of the items on their list was lying forgotten somewhere perhaps buried in someone garden by a neighborhood dog albus considered harry new idea for a moment before saying slowly yes that a definite possibility it also possible he had time to make the horcrux but not to curse it or hide it as he had planned i think maybe you and i should pay a visit to godric hollow sometime soon is is it still there harry couldntquite decide how he felt about a visit to the home where he was born and in which his birth parents died part of him wanted to see it and part of him was afraid it would be too difficult too real in a manner of speaking yes the property and remainder of the house technically passed to you upon the death of james and lily and as it unplottable and muggles cannot see the house i felt it best to just leave things as they were until you were old enough to make the decisions about how to handle the estate harry voice was flat and weary with shock when he spoke next you mean all this time i ve owned the house and you never mentioned it that makes two houses i ve inherited now and i dontthink i want either one of them none the less they may both be useful to you before all this is over now let go to bed we ll plan a trip for early next week but all of that can be discussed tomorrow it took albus and harry very little time to make the preparations for their trip to godric hollow they would travel late at night under cover of darkness as well as invisibility bill weasley and tonks would be stationed near by in case the two needed help quickly but they wouldntknow the purpose of the errand and i to stay here and take care of the school i suppose minerva asked wearily when albus told her they were going my dear you know that the most important task in all of this we ve always put hogwarts and the students first in our lives i wouldnttrust them to anyone else i know she sighed unwilling and unable to have the same old discussion yet again just promise me you ll be careful you know i always am when albus saw the sad and worried look on her face he took minerva in his arms and whispered i promise before kissing her tenderly they left just before midnight on the thirtieth of october promising to be home by dawn minerva didntlike the idea of them leaving the castle so close to halloween it seemed that disaster always chose that particular day on which to strike lately and she didntwant her family scattered about the country if anything should happen heedless of her warnings albus and harry set out at the appointed time confident that nothing would go wrong leaving harry under his invisibility cloak albus met with bill and tonks just outside the little village where harry had been born he gave them their instructions without revealing the nature or intent of the mission and had them each take a post on either side of the house to watch for signs of distress he then lead harry carefully through the dark to the potters home it still looked just as it had sixteen years ago when hagrid rescued harry and took him to surrey some of the windows were blown out and one entire corner of the first floor had fallen in on itself when they entered the house harry realized that the damage was much more extensive than it looked from outside the area just past the front door and the staircase had been hit especially hard from his father battle with voldemort harry surmised paint had pealed off the wall and the hardwood floors were rotting no doubt due to the rain and snow having free reign of the house for years careful on the stairs albus cautioned as he began to climb slowly upwards harry braced himself not quite sure what to expect once they reached the top of the stairs it dawned on him after a moment that the room with the most damage must have been his nursery and his grip on his wand tightened as they prepared to enter it the first sight to meet his eyes was his cot remarkably intact given the state of the rest of the house this room had certainly suffered the most damage there were collapsed bookshelves and a bit of the ceiling was missing which had caused the roof and attic to fall down into the nursery albus watched silently as harry surveyed the damage before turning his attention to the cot harry hands ran absently over the wooden bars as he tried to imagine himself just over a year old sat in the tiny bed with no idea what was going on around him and yet somehow surviving a shiver ran over his back and he shook himself out of his reverie let have a look around harry suggested sounding braver than he felt at the moment they began carefully sifting through the rubble neither of them sure what to look for or whether they would find it minutes turned into hours as they searched finding many objects of interest but none that seemed to be the right one finally out of desperation harry tried a summoning spell beginning with the first object on his list of horcruxes yet to be found accio helga hufflepuff cup he thought holding out his wand to his great shock the engraved silver cup he d seen in the pensieve several months ago came flying through the air into his hand he looked at his father stunned why didntwe think of that hours ago albus wondered harry shrugged i didntthink it would work since we didntreally know what to summon did you see where this was before it flew up here it looked like it came from beneath the stairs i think you re right and may i suggest we go see what else may be down there shrinking the cup and tucking it in his pocket harry carefully followed albus back down the stairs to inspect the ground floor rubble after a short time they decided there was nothing more they needed from the house and that it would be best to get back to hogwarts before the sun rose unfortunately they wouldntbe able to make the trip as planned halloween dawned cold and rainy at hogwarts and remained so throughout the day in between lessons minerva oversaw the preparations for the feast that night she d always found the halloween feast to be a bit unnecessary but albus always said it was a good time to let the children blow off some steam coming approximately halfway between the start of term and the winter holidays he felt that making an event out of halloween would give the children not only the chance to indulge their sweet tooth but also an excuse to take the evening away from their studies to just enjoy each others company so she made it her day mission to oversee the meal the way albus would have done when there was no sign of albus or harry by suppertime though she began to worry albus had assured her that this would be a short trip they knew exactly where they were going and what they wanted to find and expected no interference he d said minerva tried to console herself with the thought that if anything had happened she d have had some news by now but still she found it difficult to enjoy the feast or even to eat while she wondered where they had gone her worry escalated to near paralyzing levels when the dessert course of the halloween feast was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of dozens of mail owls owls of all colors and sizes swooped about the great hall dropping letters and packages onto the laps and plates of various students but it wasntuntil a special evening edition of the daily prophet landed on top of minerva lemon pie that she was startled into action a quick glance at the headlines was all she had time for before the hall erupted into chaos multiple fires destroyed homes believed to be work of you know who minerva stood and pointed her wand toward the ceiling a quick explosion from the end of her wand recalled the attention of the curious and worried students prefects kindly lead your houses back to the common rooms i will have the house elves send up the remaining food so that you may continue the feast i will also ask the staff to please remain in the great hall for a few minutes after which time they will be available in their offices to meet with any students who feel the need to discuss tonight news you are all dismissed please proceed quietly to the dormitories she watched the students leave careful to show no outward signs of worry until the hall was empty then turned to the rest of the staff with a look of grim determination is dumbledore back yet asked filius flitwick the diminutive charms professor not to my knowledge minerva hoped she didntsound as uneasy as she felt i feel that the school is safe for tonight but i will ask the heads of house to please check on their students and all teachers to be available between now and curfew to students who may wish to confide their worries everyone nodded his or her agreement and broke off into twos and threes for quiet discussion of the very rare evening edition of the paper as they left the great hall poppy pomfrey quietly hung back from the others and waited for minerva did albus take harry this time the mediwitch whispered minerva nodded letting her guard down long enough for her old friend to see the worry in her green eyes poppy squeezed minerva arm i sure they re all right they both know how to take care of themselves besides if anything had happened someone would have heard by now i know you re right but i canthelp worrying they were supposed to be home ages ago perhaps albus felt it safest to wait out the danger where ever they were rather than traveling minerva shook her head no if i know them at all they went to fight or at least to help those who ve been attacked after a few more reassuring words from poppy the women went their separate ways poppy hurried back to the hospital wing to ensure she had a good supply of dreamless sleep potion in case the news gave any of the younger children nightmares while minerva took up residence in her office to meet with those students who might need her while minerva was at hogwarts keeping panic at bay and answering the questions of students and staff alike albus and harry had indeed gone to aid in the defense against voldemort death eaters when they rejoined bill at his station he informed them of the breaking news the death eaters had attacked the family of the senior undersecretary to the minister for magic and it looked very much like there would be more attacks soon the three men summoned tonks and then set off for the new order headquarters arthur weasley reported in from the ministry several times throughout the day and those order members not involved at either hogwarts or the ministry were informed of the situation and brought to headquarters those members already gathered at headquarters carefully traveled to the available others and slowly spread the word as the sun began to set in late afternoon the order regrouped and prepared to do battle against the death eaters within minutes they had news of more attacks on high ranking ministry employees and their families albus tried to send harry back to hogwarts but he refused to go insisting that he would be more useful by staying with the order so they all carefully set out to try and help people defend themselves unfortunately as they couldntget definite information on the death eaters movements it was something like going on a wild goose chase for the order members they managed to capture a few of voldemort followers and turn them over to the aurors but werentas successful as they d hoped in sparing people homes and families from destruction by the time the sun rose on the first of november eight people had been killed and another two reported missing after giving instructions to the rest of the order albus finally took harry home he knew that minerva would be worried and wondered if news of the attacks had arrived at hogwarts yet there hadntbeen time to notice the evening paper and he hoped to beat the morning edition to the school they apparated to the school gates and quietly slipped upstairs to the suite of rooms they all called home expecting to find minerva just waking to begin the day instead they found her curled up asleep on the couch still in her robes from the day before with dark circles under her eyes and a troubled look on her face we should have sent her a letter harry whispered experiencing a pang of guilt for causing her to worry it wasntsafe albus knew that minerva had grown used to his lengthy absences and non communication when away from the school but he also knew how much she worried and it hurt him to see the physical signs of her troublesome night he crossed to the couch and knelt down taking her hand in both of his and preparing to wake her but the newspaper lying across her stomach caught his attention albus let go of minerva and quickly read the article his expression growing even more sad no wonder she didntsleep he whispered giving the paper to harry albus very carefully and gently levitated minerva from the couch into the bedroom with a few simple flicks of his wand her robes became a nightgown and her long dark locks were released from the tight bun minerva always wore albus smoothed the covers up over her and touched her face gently with his good hand taking a seat beside her on the bed minerva stirred and her eyes fluttered open albus is it really you shh go back to sleep love it really me harry and i are both home safely and we can tell you were awake for most of the night today is saturday so you just sleep as long as necessary i so glad you re home i was so worried minerva sat up and wrapped her arms around albus neck needing to assure herself that he was really there and not a dream he returned her embrace before kissing her tenderly and trying to force her to lie back down where is harry minerva protested i here mum harry entered the room and crossed to her side everything is all right please get some sleep minerva reached out and squeezed both their hands dontyou ever do that to me again either of you before she could say anything more minerva body relaxed and her eyes closed again her hands slowly slipped away from albus and harry as she fell into a much needed sleep albus kissed her cheek and then motioned harry out of the room they had to inspect the cup they d found at godric hollow and albus needed to check on the students and staff after last night upset a n many apologies for the delay in updating real life and all i ll try to do better next time but no promises also many many thanks to those of you still reading and reviewing a n i continue to be amazed and flattered that people are still following this story despite my unforgivably slow posts i doing my best to get the rest of it to you before the release of book 7 so you can all laugh at my ridiculous theories as a treat for all your patience and kind reviews i ll be posting two chapters tonight enjoy chapter 48 the department of mysteries two days after their discovery about the necklace harry and his friends were accosted on their way to quidditch practice by order members tonks and kingsly shacklebolt wotcher harry tonks hailed from across the lawns what are you two doing here he asked once the two aurors had caught them up we re taking you three and hermione if she free on a field trip to the department of mysteries seein as how ron and hermione are interested in jobs there she said with a wink interested in a job at the department of mysteries ron was truly mystified harry on the other hand understood immediately brilliant how d you manage it so fast i ve got a few friends in the department and they agreed to let a very small group of serious students in to certain rooms only kingsly explained in his deep calm voice i ll just go find hermione then ron offered turning back to the castle no need here she comes ginny interrupted but tonks you said ron and hermione were interested in working there why are harry and i going as well somebody got to do the distracting and the thieving she laughed why do you think we re going at the end of the day by the time hermione had joined them and the explanation had been given yet again harry had managed to lock up their brooms in the storage shed near the quidditch pitch and they were all ready to go they had to take a portkey as ginny was still underage for apparition and harry steeled himself for the stomach turning ride closing his eyes tightly and trying to think of anything else to his surprise harry only stumbled a bit and didntfall when the portkey brought them to a stop in the main entrance of the ministry for magic he managed to catch hermione as she pitched forward toward the fountain of magical brethren she was the only one of them who d not been inside the ministry before and they all waited a few moments while she looked around in awe kingsly boomed a deep friendly voice from the other side of the fountain i see you ve brought our students just in time which of you are coming with us then ron and hermione stepped forward to be introduced to the wizard from the department of mysteries he didntlook at all like harry had expected he d been prepared for a serious bookish sort of person but kingsly friend was very much like kingsly and the other aurors harry had met tall young casually cheerful and seemingly laid back despite his very serious and dangerous work harry and ginny here are more interested in our side of things tonks explained but they asked to come along and have a look at your department might change their minds if you give them a good tour the man whose name turned out to be toby agreed as long as they promised not to touch anything and not to get in the way the students all agreed and followed the older wizards and witch through security where their wands were registered and they received visitor badges and into the lift what re all those flying papers hermione asked ducking and brushing them away from her hair internal memos tonks laughed better than a lift full of owls not to mention an inbox full of owl droppings eh toby added to hermione great disgust they stopped at several floors on the way down but at last the cool female voice of the lift mechanism announced level 10 the department of mysteries and they all piled into the corridor tonks held harry and ginny back as the others followed toby through a locked door stay together she whispered harshly if you get lost in there we re all in trouble but stick with me and we ll get what we came for she didntknow exactly what they were after or why harry knew but her experience and knowledge were going to be invaluable so he immediately agreed to stay close to her side as they were taken through the off limits department hurry up you three called a voice from ahead harry you gotta see these clocks mate hurry up they followed the sound of ron voice into a room filled with all manner and sizes of clocks including many many hour glasses those arentclocks hermione said softly reaching out a hand to one of the largest hour glasses how far back would one like this take you we dontknow the fella who tried it hasntbeen heard from again so we assume he still lost in time that was a mistake oh yes we ve made a few over the years toby sounded sad but also wistful about the experiments that had gone wrong hermione shivered and pulled her hand away from the giant time turner the four students were taken on a brief tour of the department of mysteries which left them all staring in amazement and quite forgetful of their true purpose at the ministry toby showed them a room filled with a miniature replica of the solar system complete with orbiting planets and stars some nearly as big as a small person then he opened the door to what looked like a large auditorium or amphitheatre and told them not to go in but that it was a room where very wise and talented wizards studied death apparently the time turners werentthe only things that had caused accidents over the years and only the bravest and most careful were allowed to get anywhere near the odd veil they saw hanging from an arch at one end of the room harry quite lost track of all the things they had seen though he remembered particularly a hall of prophecies which consisted of a lot of small glass spheres on many high shelves and the brain room wherein ron was nearly attacked by a long strand of memory trailing from one brain near the surface of the tank hermione was the first to wake up from the amazing sights and ask indirectly for what they were seeking professor dumbledore says you have a room for the study of various artifacts with spells placed on them particularly curses she asked cautiously we have but i canttake you in there it more than my job worth luckily for tonks harry and ginny toby gestured to the closed door on the right as he spoke they now knew where they had to go but not what difficulties they might find beyond that door the two aurors shared a look and kingsly drew his friend into a room on the left while asking many questions on behalf of the students as soon as they were out of sight harry broke for the door behind which he hoped to find the object of this false field trip ginny stood watch outside the door while tonks went inside with harry he stopped short on the threshold and stared around at the multitude of broken and bizarre objects many of the items were muggle creations and had apparently been confiscated due to dangerous enchantments being placed upon them in a heavy glass case straight ahead there was a television set with one bent antenna hovering about a foot off the floor and randomly shooting out great bolts of electricity the more ordinary objects lined the room on benches and shelves all protected with some sort of glass or plastic shield harry found the necklace quickly enough but it was in a case with two heavy books a battered pewter drinking goblet a photograph of a shrieking old hag and what looked like a muggle video cassette what an odd assortment to be in one container he mused how on earth are we going to get it out of there tonks held up one finger to quiet him and crept toward the other door leading from the room to listen after a moment she made a gesture to harry to hurry up and came scurrying back across the room toward him someone coming she hissed harry didntknow what else to do so he got out his handkerchief and prepared to take the necklace he eased open the top of the case which turned out not to be locked much to his surprise and then ducked as the various items within came flying out at him the goblet smashed into a shelf behind him causing a great clattering and clinking as more objects crashed to the floor or took to the air all accompanied by the now audible screaming and raving of the hag in the photo using skills honed by years on the quidditch pitch harry only just managed to reach up and snag the necklace as it went soaring past his ear he wrapped it in the handkerchief and left the rest of the object floating about to look for new homes as he and tonks fled the room meanwhile all the tape was unspooling from the video and they had to dodge its almost intelligent groping through the air as they ran there you are toby exclaimed coming round the corner just as harry stuffed his bounty into his pocket thought i d lost you lot forever sorry harry chimed in i needed the loo and i guess i forgot where i was because i just started opening doors looking for it what an adventure but i dontthink any of us got hurt where d you get that awful story about needing the boy room ron asked later it worked didntit anyway it was all i could think of at the moment i d just been dodging a great load of cursed metal objects flinging themselves at my head what was it like in there ginny asked eagerly it was very strange some of the things in there looked completely harmless and others were clearly dangerous i wonder what they do with them all the four of them had stayed up long after the rest of gryffindor house went to bed so they could finally talk over the events at the ministry that department of mysteries was pretty cool ron said for the hundredth time i might just think about a job there for real you ll have to take more n e w t s than you re taking classes this year hermione said you dontknow that i going to talk to professor mcgonagall in the morning harry and ginny could both hear and see a fight coming on as ron ears went red and hermione straightened up taking on her i know best posture yes yes we ll ask her later i more interested in that necklace ginny interrupted physically creating more distance between her brother and her friend go on harry let have a look he spread his handkerchief carefully on the rug in front of the fire as they all gathered round donttouch he warned holding out his arms to keep them back of course we re not going to touch it how stupid do we look hermione pouted you d have to be pretty daft katie was in hospital for months ron added harry looked back and forth between them thought for a moment and decided to risk it from where i sitting the pair of you do look pretty daft actually ron ears coloured again what that supposed to mean do you two even notice how much you argue and over what trivial subjects one of you can hardly speak without the other finding some ridiculous fault ron and hermione looked at each other then blushed and looked away we re tired of it ginny joined in sliding closer to harry on the floor either tell each other how you feel or get over each other exactly harry folded his arms over his chest and sat watching his friends hoping they d put aside their pride for a minute and do the right thing ron cleared his throat opened his mouth to speak closed it and cleared his throat again pulling at the neck of his robes erm hermione that is i eh he looked to harry pleadingly clearly needing help harry just shook his head and gestured to hermione leaving his best friend to sort this one out for himself ron swallowed hard and finally looked up at hermione stammering some more me too she said softly placing her hand over his a slow incredulous smile spread over ron face quickly changing into one of astonished happiness harry and ginny looked away as their friends shared their first kiss right thanks harry now what about this horcrux he turned back to see a pair of matching smiles and his friends holding hands yeah cheers mate ron added sorry to interrupt ginny winked at harry who slipped his arm around her shoulders before they delved back into discussion of the horcrux there must be a way to test it he said to be sure it the real thing hermione where that library book you borrowed last month the one with the full chapter on horcruxes hermione summoned her bag and pulled out a large very old book thumbing through it for the appropriate chapter have you been carrying that around all this time ron asked in amazement i was afraid to leave it anywhere there some really dark stuff in here harry couldntyou just destroy the necklace i mean how did you know about the other horcruxes my dad figured out two of them and the third we knew was right because we had a fake to compare with it they were all fairly easy to destroy the diary burned right up in a regular fire and the gold was quickly melted once we got it hot enough diary what diary ginny asked sharply the one ron and i found in moaning myrtle bathroom second year during the chamber of secrets scare dad thinks whoever had it was the one who opened the chamber under riddle influence of course he must have got smart though because it looked like it had been flushed in an attempt to get rid of it when we found it all the colour had drained out of ginny face and her voice shook as she asked a diary that answered back when you wrote in it flushed down the third toilet in the second floor girl room how did you it was you harry stared at her wide eyed and mouth agape how did you get it i dontknow she cried clearly distressed it was in with my school things after we went shopping in diagon alley i thought it was fantastic at first an anonymous friend built into a diary but then it started to scare me and i tried to get rid of it i didntmean to open the chamber or attack all those people in your school things hermione mused wasntthat the shopping trip when your dad had a fight with malfoy dad of course ron smacked his fist against his palm lucius must have slipped the diary into your stack of books so you d bring it to hogwarts and open the chamber the dirty bugger if he wasntin azkaban i d kill him to think he d use a first year to do something so horrible you re not not mad at me are you harry ginny asked cautiously not even listening to her brother tirade harry held her close for a long moment and kissed the top of her head not a bit it wasntyour fault i just glad you tried to get rid of it when you did and that i found it instead of someone else she clung to him for a bit not saying anything and then sat back and took a deep breath i cantbelieve that all those years ago we had a piece of you know who soul right in our hands and didntknow it my dad knew that one reason he figured out what voldemort was up to and how we could beat him really lucius did us a favour though he certainly didntmean to help us at all that still doesnthelp us with this hermione interjected looking up from the chapter she d been reading we cantdestroy opals in a fire can we it d have to be pretty hot if we could i dontthink we can manage it on our own what about acid ron suggested disintegrate them in something really vile and vanish the whole lot chapter 51 the final horcrux destroyed the boy who lived i ready to fight a daily prophet exclusive interview by rita skeeter it been over two years since i last sat down with harry potter with that interview we brought you the true story of you know who return to power now in this exclusive interview i bring you the true story of harry potter and how he plans to defeat you know who for the second time in sixteen years the boy who lived certainly doesntlook like a boy anymore he grown taller and broader since i last spoke with him and he handles himself like an adult i think i ve been forced to grow up before my time he said in response to my questions you know who ed harry says the name without fear what a brave young man has been after me since i was a baby and yes i think i ve had a much different childhood than most people but dontthink for a moment that he regrets this it made me strong helped make me who i am today and along the way i ve made some wonderful friends i ve always had help harry had some very strong words to say about his past interactions with he who must not be named as well as what he foresees will be future interactions the young wizard called the dark lord a coward miserable friendless a bully of the worst sort and assured me that he only trying to kill harry because he scared come on what kind of master of the dark arts attacks a one year old baby he scoffed that not power and it not frightening he a bit sad really i feel sorry for him harry said later my parents died just like his but i found other people to love me and he didn t still he didnthave to choose to be evil someone somewhere would have loved him this reporter doesntquite understand our young mr potter attitude but i must say it sounds commendable no one ever thought of he who must not be named as a figure of pity or a coward before later on in our talk harry told me confidentially that you know who happens to be a half blood for all his talk about purity of the wizarding race and his mistreatment of other half bloods and muggle borns it turns out that his father was a muggle i think we may have just found out the dark lord dirtiest secret thank you harry potter harry finished our interview by telling me that he tired of you know who games and he ready to face him man to man without all the tricks and deceit if you know who is man enough to face me openly and in a proper duel then i cantwait he said the article went on into a bit of fluff about harry progress at school becoming captain of the quiddtich team and whether or not he had an active love life he d refused to give any details and left rita to conjecture on her own harry stopped reading before that part and looked around at his friends well what do you think at least she printed what you really said this time hermione offered uncertainly you did actually say all that of course and i knew she d print it because it inflammatory and it makes me sound a bit daft barking bloody mad more like ron interrupted look mate we know you ve got a plan of some sort and that this is part of it but i dontunderstand are you trying to make you know who angry yes i want to make him angry and i want him to come after me without the time to concoct some elaborate and ridiculous scheme just like i said in the paper i want to face him properly i finally ready but you know he ll bring his death eaters and probably that awful snake ron protested and he sure to fight dirty ginny added i dontthink honour means much to him that why the order will be there and you all if you re willing i not stupid i promise it just time for this to be over hermione had been re reading the first part of the article and now she looked up and smiled at harry you know this is really clever not only is it going to make voldemort really really angry but it going to make other people question his power maybe even make his followers doubt him exactly harry smiled thank you hermione now we have to get ready for him when he comes for me the interview which ran on the front page of the daily prophet along with a large picture of harry created a big commotion in the wizarding world at large students who didntknow him well stared at him in the great hall and whispered when they passed him in the corridors professors smiled proudly and winked knowingly when harry passed by and owls poured in from far and wide some people supported harry some still thought he was a liar and attention seeker others had decided he was mad and a few were vaguely threatening no matter what the reaction of each individual harry was just glad people had read the interview and were responding the positive feedback and encouragement far outweighed and outnumbered the negative responses which also made harry feel good people were open to what he d said they were looking for a way to be less scared and making voldemort seem more like a broken shell of a person than a monster had gone a long way toward relieving them harry didnttell anyone but about an hour after the paper was delivered that morning his scar had started burning throbbing painfully with his pulse as he emptied his mind of thoughts and emotion to shut out the dark lord he smiled because he knew his plan was working that afternoon albus and harry called a meeting of the order of the phoenix albus office was full to overflowing hagrid professors flitwick sprout and dawlish mad eye moody kingsly shakebolt all the weasleys except molly and fleur and all the rest of the surviving order members piled in eager to hear what harry had to say even tonks turned up letting them all know she was there for remus also in attendance were neville luna ron hermione ginny and to harry surprise dean seamus and the creevy brothers harry looked around at them all and felt his nervousness melting away good afternoon he smiled round at them thank you all for coming i really cantsay that enough when i look around this room and remember everything we ve all been through together and everything that some of you have been through in the years before the rest of us were born i just overwhelmed by the amount of dedication the bravery and the love you each have for your fellow man whether it for a specific person or just for people in general i know we ve all been fighting and making amazing sacrifices for love we ve lost parents children friends brothers and sisters and still kept going i just want you all to take a few moments later today when you leave here and really think about that if it werentfor people like yourselves the world would be a vastly different place it time for all the sacrifices to end though voldemort has kept us all prisoners of his vile will for long enough i dontwant anyone else to die i sure you all read the paper this morning and you probably have questions i arranged that interview and said a lot of inflammatory things on purpose so that voldemort would get angry and come looking for me that why you re all here i have to fight him myself but if he brings his death eaters i need you to keep them busy while i deal with voldemort also and this is very very important if he brings his pet snake someone has to kill her right away without even thinking about it if you see her kill her he spent a few minutes answering questions and giving a bit of a pep talk and then they were interrupted by a commotion on the front lawns it him ron exclaimed in surprise turning round from the window face pale eyes the size of saucers minerva and the other professors rushed out to make sure all the students had come inside and were safe her voice rang through the building instructing all students to return to their dormitories immediately so their heads of house could perform a head count under no circumstances are you to leave the common rooms until you receive further notice she finished while the rest of the students were scrambling inside shaking with fear and amazement harry and his friends were heading outside just as minerva announcement to the students ended a loud angry voice could be heard ringing through the front entrance hall harry potter boy who lived are you there i heard there a little boy here who wants to fight me ah there you are voldemort smiled and opened his arms in a terrible parody of welcome as harry stepped outside i thought you might show up tom harry said putting emphasis on voldemort birth name dontuse that wretched muggle name he screamed why not it the name your mother gave you your mother who presumably loved you at least for a moment before she died perhaps you could explain to me potter just why i should care about the emotions of a blood traitor i never even met who was disowned by the true heirs of slytherin for tainting the purity of our race i thought you were challenging me to a fight not a philosophical discourse several members of the order had slowly followed harry outside along with a few of his friends all on guard for a sudden attack ah i see you ve brought your friends voldemort sneered how thoughtful of you i was afraid my friends might go unwelcomed as he spoke several masked figures in black hooded robes stepped out of the forest and entered through the gates ron and his brothers stepped forward wands drawn along with moody tonks and a few others but nobody made a move to attack first the death eaters formed a semi circle behind voldemort as a brisk breeze blew across the lawns removing a few of their hoods and knocking masks askew bellatrix lestrange neville hissed rushing forward several of the death eaters laughed and bellatrix herself stepped forward so the children want to play let indulge them shall we master fine but leave potter for me voldemort ordered still no one moved though the lines of battle were clearly drawn everyone was waiting for someone else to strike first waiting for a signal from their respective leaders as they waited and watched a large snake raised her head above voldemort shoulder her tongue flickering as she hissed in his ear after a brief conversation nagini slithered over his shoulder and circled around his body several times as she worked her way toward the ground she was quickly making her way toward harry when fred and george stepped forward almost as one person and cast the spells that killed her her body continued forward for a few inches and then dropped to the ground limp and lifeless the tongue protruding slightly from the mouth voldemort howled with rage kill them what d he say to it ron whispered to harry i ll tell you later harry raised his wand and stepped closer to voldemort bowing as he was taught to do before a duel voldemort smirked and returned the bow flourishing his wand which harry instantly noticed was different from the one he d had during their last battle as the two of them squared off for what they each new would be their final duel harry could see his friends engaging the death eaters all around them spells flying through the air in all directions he gave a moment thought to hoping they would all survive and then shut himself off from everything except his feelings of love for his friends who were with him that day as well as those who they d lost to this fight already he felt no fear and no anger i just want you to know tom he said as they circled each other warily testing each other with simple offensive maneuvers i forgive you for killing my parents i not angry anymore i wish you could have known just a tiny bit of the love i ve known all my life enough i dontwant to hear anymore of your love nonsense voldemort fired the first real spell harry artfully dodged the curse and sent back one of his own the fight raged on all over the lawns and for the first time harry felt in control of the situation and equally matched to voldemort occasionally he could hear screams of pain and outrage coming from the others around him but he never knew if it was an order member or a death eater after what seemed an eternity harry stopped to wipe the blood and sweat from his face and took a moment to look around him he was surprised to find that a circle of order members was gradually forming around himself and voldemort he fired off a few more curses and defensive spells and then looked around again the death eaters had all been put out of commission in some way and were lying around the wide expanse of grass in various prostrate poses he caught his father eye for a moment and found renewed energy in the pride and love he saw shining from those familiar blue eyes voldemort had also become aware of their situation and he made several mistakes as he began to actually worry all of his followers were gone his faithful pet was dead and he was facing dozens of people who wanted to see him dead all your horcruxes are gone harry said calmly i ve destroyed them all if you die now it all over all but one voldemort hissed darting toward harry several people shouted in fear and moved toward them thinking voldemort was rushing in to kill harry just as suddenly they stopped and stared in shock where before there had been two men now there was only harry where did he go someone asked in a high panicky voice harry groaned in pain and fell to his knees his whole body felt like it was on fire as he fought the invasion of the dark lord moments later he was as surprised and appalled as everyone else to hear a strange voice coming from his mouth kill the boy go on then i ll be gone too he taunted panting harry struggled against the feelings of hate and anger he looked up at the circle of stunned on lookers knowing he needed help his eyes fell on ginny and then his mum and dad and he felt his chest swelling with feelings of love once more he continued around the circle making eye contact with ron hermione mr weasley and the others when he got to tonks he thought of remus which made him remember sirius and then his birth parents and he remembered the sacrifices they had all made and how love had saved him so long ago the next thing he knew the pain had subsided and it was voldemort now screaming in anguish as he tore himself from harry body they ve all been destroyed he repeated standing up then he looked around at his friends once more before taking advantage of voldemort momentary weakness to stun him he stood panting and shaking over the body of his fallen opponent his wand still aimed at voldemort chest go on boy finish him off moody said gruffly but with obvious pride no harry shook his head no i wontsink to his level it illegal even if he is a monster and anyway you have to hate to use those spells and i donthate him call the dementors that the only right thing to do kingsly shakelbolt had gone off to the ministry once the death eaters had all been subdued he alerted the rest of the aurors as well as the minister and other senior personnel and the dementors had been called to hogwarts harry only had to stand guard over voldemort body for a few minutes before everyone arrived the others watched over the death eaters to make sure none managed to escape somehow or kept watch over harry and voldemort no one had yet stopped to tend to their injuries or to notice that a few of them had fallen in the fight but while they waited for the ministry officials madam pomfrey and professor sprout came outside and began administering potions and healing spells where they could the dementor kiss was performed almost immediately once the prison guards arrived and voldemort body was destroyed the minister tried to talk to harry but he didnthave time he was too busy reconnecting with his friends and family checking everyone injuries and making sure they were all okay about six people tried to hug him at once laughing through their tears as they formed a loose queue around him minerva got to him first and after a long crushing hug she held his face in her hands and wiped away a trail of blood she opened her mouth to speak shook her head and pulled him close again you re hurt i saw you limping harry said his face clouding over with worry albus slipped in beside them and wrapped one arm around each of their shoulders holding his family close it nothing i fine minerva answered you re both still alive that all that matters albus squeezed harry tightly against his side well done harry you made all the right choices he smiled proudly then gave his son a gentle push toward his friends pulling minerva into his chest as her tears began to flow once more with his arm wrapped firmly around ginny shoulders harry spent the next several minutes exchanging hugs and handshakes with everyone where neville he asked after a bit they ve taken him off to the hospital wing luna answered he finally got the best of that bellatrix lestrange but she hurt him pretty badly first broke his leg i think and just about cut him in half from the look of him he ll be all right madam pomfrey can fix anything said ron whose own arm was dangling oddly from his shoulder dislocated it he explained in answer to harry question doesnthurt professor dawlish is dead dean and seamus came up to join the ever growing group dean pointed across the lawns to a fallen body it looks like voldemort curse on the position lasted right up to the end harry had to take a moment to explain tom riddle history with the defense teacher job did everyone else make it it turned out that all but two of the others were alive but some were in very serious condition and were being rushed to st mungo immediately for treatment the others were helping each other with cuts bruises broken bones and other minor injuries professor slughorn ventured outside laden with several steaming cauldrons healing potions and hot mulled mead for everyone he announced dontmix them up later he took harry aside and admitted that he felt responsible for some of his troubles if i hadntanswered his questions about horcruxes maybe he wouldnthave been able to come back again and put you through so much pain it not your fault he d have found the answers somewhere please dontworry harry assured him it over now so no more wondering what if a few reporters had managed to follow the minister to hogwarts and they were busy taking pictures of the aftermath and trying to interview everyone just one quote harry rita skeeter begged harry sighed and then turned to face her all right tell people that he wontbe back again and they can stop worrying it time to live freely again it wasntuntil the celebratory feast that night that anyone noticed the lighting bolt shaped scar on harry forehead had faded he pushed his hair back off his face catching a ray of candle light against the skin and ginny gasped harry your scar it gone epilogue harry lay on the blanket with his arms folded behind his head eyes closed as he soaked up the sun and listened to the roar of the ocean he felt a shadow fall across his body as someone stood over him you look more like james than ever said a familiar voice remus harry opened his eyes and sprang to his feet embracing his friend i heard you were out of hospital but i didntexpect to see you till we went home i couldntresist albus generous offer to join you here for a few days it nice to get away for a rest but there a full moon tonight arentyou worried remus smiled that the best part since i killed greyback i haventhad a single transformation for three full moons i cured remus that brilliant they settled down on the blanket to talk about old times and old friends now departed for the next great adventure watching fred and george set up their fireworks display for later that night while ron chased hermione down the beach after the school year had ended and everyone had taken their n e w t s albus surprised harry and minerva with the news that he d arranged for their family to have a house on the costa blanca for two weeks he d invited the entire weasley family to join them as well and they had all been enjoying a much deserved rest by the ocean harry had spent most of it relaxing on the beach watching his friends frolic in the ocean remus albus exclaimed as he and minerva approached i so glad you decided to join us he helped minerva get settled in a beach chair before embracing his friend and former student bloody walking stick she grumbled after also saying hello to remus i never thought i d have to see this thing again lunch is ready molly called coming out of the house with several baskets of food levitating behind her fred george charlie come help me set up you should have let me help minerva admonished as everyone pitched in to spread out blankets and unload the heavy baskets nonsense you ve done quite enough already and just need to focus on resting that hip harry ate in silence listening to everyone else conversations and laughter as they enjoyed the small feast mrs weasley had prepared everyone wounds had finally healed and the scars were beginning to fade though a few of them still wore bandages and of course minerva was once more dependent on her walking stick the memory of that fateful day however would never fade from harry memory nor would the lessons he learned in preparation of that day fleur also came out of the house carrying her two month old baby carefully in her arms and settling under a large umbrella to share lunch with her family she sleeping fleur whispered smiling as the others leaned over to inspect the baby tiny hands and feet and marvel at her full head of red hair for the hundredth time since her birth i hope you all have girls ginny told the rest of her brothers we need a few more in this family just before sunset harry took ginny off for a private walk the only chance they d really had to be alone all week we ll be back before the fire works he promised fred as they started off about an hour later they returned hand in hand and glowing with happiness harry looked around at ginny five elder brothers standing in a line along the beach and decided it was a good job they all liked him then he turned to the chairs where all four of their parents were seated mr and mrs weasley mum dad we d like to ask for your blessings ginny and i want to get married next summer when she finished with school the young couple was overwhelmed with happy family members pouncing on them in congratulations and well wishes for a happy future harry noticed his mum and mrs weasley already discussing details like where they would hold the wedding and what sort of food to serve and he had to laugh he waited for the excitement to settle down and then looked at the twins seems like a perfect time for some of those wizarding weezes fire crackers they whooped in unison and headed down toward the water to start the first of the explosions harry settled down on the sand with ginny and quietly slipped her the ring he d been saving until her parents agreed to the marriage she smiled down at it and leaned up to kiss him softly before resting her head on his shoulder to watch her brothers show off their new toys later that week harry found himself alone with his parents for the first time the entire holiday are you happy harry minerva asked you ve been very quiet ever since we arrived i ve never been happier except he stopped except what son albus asked whatever it is you know we ll help you if we can well it just that now this is all over i not sure what to do with myself i used to think i wanted to train as an auror after hogwarts but now i think i ve had enough of that sort of thing i think what i d really like is to teach defense against the dark arts at hogwarts i really enjoyed leading the d a in fifth year and watching people reactions when they finally mastered a difficult spell my days of fighting dark wizards are over but i d like to help prepare the next generation for it he looked up and found that both of his parents were beaming at him we d love to have you on staff harry but you ll need a bit more training first minerva explained you ve always been a wonderful teacher and i so glad you ve realised it yourself she was secretly very relieved that he no longer wanted to be an auror i wonder albus said thoughtfully i just going to have a talk with remus before he goes back to london excuse me with very little persuasion remus agreed to return to hogwarts as the defense teacher now that the curse had been lifted he could stay there for as long as he liked harry would also stay at hogwarts working as his assistant and training in the evenings so that someday he could take over the courses the author note of doom wow this project was much more difficult and time consuming than i ever imagined when i first started i thrilled that so many people have read and enjoyed it though i have to thank you all once again for sticking with me through the slow updates and some of the earlier chapters that were either too similar to the books or had glaring plot holes the truth is that i didntthink the whole thing through completely before i started so i struggled and made mistakes but that what makes it fun in leaving out and changing certain scenes that i later realised were quite important i made my work that much more difficult still i pleased with the overall story and proud of myself for sticking it out through the end be proud of yourselves for reading the whole thing now go enjoy the real version of all these silly things i ve made up it been a fun ride and i hope we ll all be back with more stories to keep harry and hogwarts alive for years to come
