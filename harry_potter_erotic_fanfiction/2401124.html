that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 11 handeling the truth from last chapter in the heads room lily just looked at james in disbelief you what i cantbelieve you lily yelled how could you possibly be so stupid lily let me finish explaining james said trying to calm her down this was not going well oh do go on go on tell me why you are an illegal animagius lily yelled well you see um well james started to say yeah i still listening lily said remus he s he a werewolf james said lily just stared in disbelief oh my god she said quietly and then headed to the balcony to go outside lily james started to say lily just held up one hand as she walked out signaling that she has heard enough lily rushed down the spiral staircase from the balcony and ran to a tree by the lake sat down and started crying james had to go after her he couldntstand for her to be like this maybe telling her wasntthe best idea but he had to be honest why couldntshe have taken it so well like kendall did he rushed down the stairs and found lily crying by a tree lily he said walking over to her lily please dontcry he said lily stood up and looked him straight in the eyes and for once she didntget lost in them i gave you my trust she said i forgave you for everything that you have done to me i gave you my trust and my heart and you couldntspare a moments time to tell me that you are a bloody animagius and an illegal one at that well that why i telling you now james said defending himself i was afraid of what you would do when you found out so that why i stalled he said you wonder why i never would go out with you well here is living proof that james potter cares about no one but himself you know remus told kendall about him being a werewolf and she didntblow up at him like you are blowing up at me james said bad move well remus isnta arrogant prat remus didntplay mean jokes and pranks on kendall for 6 years and claimed that he liked her lily spat back remus didntchoose to be a werewolf you chose to be an animagius lily james said putting his hand on her arm but she slapped him away crossed her arms and turned to the lake is that what you still think of me james asked lily maybe she said james was a little angry now well just for your information i didntbecome a stag for selfish reasons he said lily still was turned away but she was listening you have never seen someone turn into a werewolf and how much pain they go through me and sirius and peter became animagius so we could be there for him when he was changing james said oh lily said starting to feel a little bad now yeah oh is right you know what i dont claim to like you james said lily turned halfway towards him i love you okay james said lily eyes widened she had heard that from other people that james loved her but she never heard it from him yeah that right lily i love you and believe me i know i not the most bloody perfect student and i dontfollow all of the rules but i would think that being in love with you would make up for some of that james said james i didn t lily started to say no no you didntlily you didnteven want to hear my side you may be the smartest girl in the entire school but that doesntmean that your side is always the right side and believe me it hurts really bad to be called an arrogant prat from the only person i have ever loved and the only person i ever will love james said tears were flowing down lily cheeks and she was turned completely facing him i gotta go james said and started walking away after a minute lily came back to her senses chased after him and grabbed onto his arm hoping he would stop he did james i so sorry lily said i just didn t i mean i over reacted because if if you got caught who knows what would happen to you and i mean if you got hurt i i dontknow what i would do because because i love you to lily said sobbing now james was in shock you do he asked i do she said i do lily repeated so much so much i can hardly stand it she said now whispering at this point the only thing james could do was snatch lily up in his arms and kiss her hard on the lips lily was so happy that he forgave her once he let her go she said oh james i so sorry and then she gave him a big hug and to her great fortune he hugged her back so much thanks to everyone who has left reviews now i not sure if i should keep updating this story because

when he showed up he grabbed her arm pulled her out of the crowd and pulled her towards him and kissed her taking her completely by surprise when he finally let her go lily was out of breath jeez james you scared me half to death lily said james then spun her around and put his hands over her eyes james what are you doing she said struggling a bit but not too much i have a surprise for you he said and then led her to the heads room with his hands still over her eyes oh come on james what is this she said very anxious just a bit further he said then they reached the angel it slid aside for him james had mad previous arrangements for the angel not to ask for the password aloud and then he led lily into the heads common room he walked her in his hands still over her eyes he placed her in just the right spot and then he removed his hands lily let out a huge gasp overtaken by a mass array of lilies there were all kinds stargazer lilies tiger lilies white lilies and even bewitched lilies some had sparkles all over them some looked like it was snowing some looked like the night sky there was absolutely every kind imaginable do you like them james asked lily still had her hands clasped over her mouth in awe she eventually turned towards him and said i i love them james what is all of this for she asked we have been going out for 40 days james declared proud that he had kept count lily let out a little laugh only you she said you are just too much then she reached her arms around his neck and kissed him i love them i absolutely love them i so glad james said i had to get sirius up here to tell me if it was alright oh boy lily said laughing james laughed too lily walked up and started smelling some of the lilies james then caught site of the clock oh blimey lily i so sorry i ve got quidditch in an hour i have to go get ready oh it okay lily said james looked at her not quite sure if she was saying that sarcasticly no really james its okay she said okay james said but you ll be there watching right he asked of course she said smiling sweetly james gave a big grin lily walked up to him and gave him a big hug thanks so much for everything she said she then gave him a quick kiss on the lips okay lils i gotta go i ll see you there he said gave her hand a quick squeeze and left after james left lily looked around the room and decided on a sparkling green lily to put in her hair she tucked it behind her right ear showing she was taken and then went into her room to get her things ready and then head off for the quidditch match at the quidditch match and today match gryffindor verses ravenclaw a sixth year gryffindor yelled from the loud speaker and the teams come on ravenclaw leaded by their team captain damon beak gryffindor leaded by their team captain james potter there was a huge cheer from the crowds all of the gryffindors were cheering some ravenclaw and hufflepuff and as usual no slytherins lily let out a big whoooooooo and ferociously clapped her hands remus and kendall were cheering too sirius was playing on the team with james gryffindor was in a major lead and james was much better then the ravenclaw seeker for a while james was just hovering above the game keeping an eye out for the snitch lily could have sworn that she saw him wink at her but she will never know once james spotted the snitch he zoomed at what seemed like light speed and went after it the ravenclaw seeker was much slower and although he kept up he was no match for james james zoomed across the field dodging everything that came in his path following the snitch lily was shocked she never really realized how much talent it took to be a quidditch player let alone a seeker and in a split second the crowd went up in cheers the snitch was caught in the hands of james potter once the whole team landed then all hoist james up and carried him off of the field shouting and cheering gryffindor wins was yelled over the loud speaker lily ran down off of the stands and found james coming out of the locker room she ran up to him saying you won you did it she threw her arms around him and gave him a huge hug he then lifted her slightly off of the ground and twirled her around it was truly the perfect day disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded

alyssa asked yeah but today he is gonna work with sirius lily said alyssa eyes widened at the sound of sirius name oh okay she said rushing are you okay lily asked what yeah i fine alyssa said do you

of relief well should i tell him for you then lily asked i i suppose alyssa said but donttell him if he really doesntfancy me she said oh i sure that he does lily said alyssa smiled thanks she said no

arentjust pulling my leg are you sirius said she told me she fancies you before i told her that you fancy her lily said they started walking and sirius just had a smirk on his face the whole time um mr head in the clouds you should probably talk to her lily said right sirius said arentyou a genius james said sirius looked around and then headed towards alyssa i really dontunderstand that one lily said give it a while you get used to his unusual ways james said lily laughed i have to go get my books from my room for next class i ll meet you outside transfiguration in 10 minutes okay lily said okay james said gave her a kiss on the cheek and she left he walked to the transfiguration hallway and waited outside a couple minutes later a girl came up to james and said hi uh hi who are you again he asked leslie medston leslie said oh right you went out with sirius right james asked yeah i didntreally like him though leslie said um okay james said really confused i just went out with him so i could see you more she said in a flirty way you know i have a girlfriend right james said oh evans yeah but that never stopped you before you ve two timed before leslie said coming on to james how would you know that and besides that was like in 3rd year i not that kind of person anymore james said oh i dontknow leslie said then she took james completely by surprise and kissed him full on james was so taken back by this it took him a second to push her off of him but it was too late as soon as he pushed her away he looked down the hallway and saw lily standing there lily he said you scum how could you she yelled at him and then ran away lily he yelled running after her lily thinking ahead ran not to the heads room but to the gryffindor common room she then ran up to the girls dormitory lily he yelled again but she was already at the top he started to run up the girls dormitory steps but the stairs all smoothed down and instantly became a slide so down to the bottom james went never ever speak to me again lily hissed and then slammed the door lily then went into the girls dormitory and found kendall on her bed lily then threw herself on the end of kendall bed and started sobbing uncontrollably lily lily what wrong kendall asked very concerned then between sobs lily explained what happened but lily what if something happened that you dontknow kendall said yeah right i cantjust forget everything that james has done in the past lily said kendall just nodded can i sleep here tonight lily asked sure hun there an extra bed over there kendall said and pointed to an empty bed thanks lily said heading over to the other bed kendall could you tell my teachers that i not feeling well lily asked now doesntthat sound familiar kendall said under her breath what lily asked sure i ll go tell them kendall said thanks you re the greatest lily said and then flopped down on the bed kendall left the girls dormitory and headed down the stairs when she reached the bottom she saw james sitting there with his head in his hands looks like someone really screwed up kendall said walking past james kendall look it not what it seems lily just came james started to say but kendall cut him off listen potter i really dontwant to hear it kendall said and then left james then watched her go he stood up and look at the girls dormitory door lily he cried up to her but there was no response he then sighed and headed for the heads room raspberry james said the angel moved aside and he walked into the common room he was about to head for his room but instead went into lily room he knew that he shouldn t but he figured that lily was already mad enough at him he waked in and felt a huge lump in his throat when he looked at her nightstand on her nightstand was a very familiar looking box when he opened it he saw the earrings and necklace that he had given her for the ball behind the box was a picture of two figures in a beautiful gold frame the two figures were them james and lily when they were dancing in the rain the night of the ball he took the picture in his hands and sat on her bed he looked at the moving figures dancing in the rain it was the first time james kissed lily or rather lily kissed him james felt like such an idiot she really did love him and then something like this had to happen james knew it wasnthis fault but couldnthelp thinking that if he had just pushed leslie away a moment faster things would be different there was no way that lily would listen to him she just wasntlike that which was one of her flaws james left lily room and started to head to his own but there was then a furious knocking on the door prongs prongs it me sirius yelled james went over to the door and opened it slightly whoa you wouldntbelieve it mate alyssa is truly amazing she sirius started to say padfoot i am really not in the mood james said and then shut the door sirius was very confused but shrugged it off being all too happy until of course later finding out what really happened the next morning at breakfast which james got down to super early hoping to catch lily was most unpleasant james was sitting down at the table just staring at his plate and then lily came over she just stood there until james noticed someone was there james just looked up and met her eyes he was at a loss of words he didntknow what to say to her she just nodded potter she said then grabbed a piece of toast and left james wanted to run after her grab her and kiss her begging for her forgiveness but his feet took him nowhere james was dumbstruck she had just called him potter disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it a n thanks so much to everyone who left me reviews it makes me sooo happy knowing that you guys like my story thanks again chapter 13 time to listen you know alyssa truly has the perfect hair just the right shade of brown it like chestnut really sirius said to james whom were both laying on couches in the gryffindor common room shut it padfoot james said right sorry mate but i just so happy

disregarded him use your bloody broom sirius said right padfood you re a genius james said hence the einstein sirius said what james said just go get your broom sirius said sirius was one of the few wizards who knew who einstein was james got his broom and then flew up the stairs to the girls dormitory and then knocked on the door just to be polite come in lily said james walked in and scared lily half to death how the bloody hell did you get up here lily asked dumbstruck james just lifted up his broom lily acknowledged it get out she said lily i need to talk to you james said yeah and i sure you were just talking to leslie medston lily said bloody hell lily you have the smartest mind in this whole bloody school lets try and use it shall we james said lily had to restrain herself she really wanted to slap him what that supposed to mean lily said quite mad that supposed to mean that do you honestly think that i would want to kiss leslie medston if i was going out with the most wonderful girl in the world james said oh and you are referring to me now lily said bloody right i am lily i love you more then anything else in the entire world you are perfect in every way why would you think i would choose one of sirius ex over you james said good question lily said you cantmake this easy can you james said not after what you did no lily said listen lily i did not kiss leslie she kissed me james said oh and there a difference lily said bloody right there is james said he then explained the whole story and you just stood there letting her kiss you it took you long enough to push her off lily said lily james said but then stopped lily looked up at him and for the first time looked into his eyes i need time to think it over she said okay he said and then headed to the door lily was turned away from the door and then james spoke again lily he said lily turned around to look at him i love you he said and then shut the door behind him for the first time since the incident lily actually came and sat down for dinner this was a very good sign in james point of view lillian sirius said as lily came and sat down how kind of you to grace us with your presence he said hey sirius hey alyssa lily said noticing that alyssa was now sitting with them since she hooked up with sirius hey lily alyssa said lily smiled and then started eating james then came and really wanted to sit down next to lily like he used to do but he restrained and sat down next to sirius on the opposite side of the table clearly the farthest from lily after a bit of awkward silence lily broke the silence i all done see you guys later she said and then got up and left she headed outside and laid down by a tree looking up at the sky moony we better be heading off sirius said with a bit of eagerness in his voice james remus and peter immediately noted this right uh i ll see you later kendall remus said kendall knew that he had to go because of the full moon okay kendall said she wanted to say be careful but knew she couldntbecause then alyssa would get suspicious i ve got some stuff to do i ll see you later okay sirius said to alyssa okay alyssa said and smiled both sirius and remus gave quick good bye kissed to their girlfriends and left all four boys quickly headed to the shrieking shack and then all four of them transformed lily continued to walk around the grounds staring at the beautiful full moon completely oblivious at the moment to the fact that a werewolf was wondering around although she knew about remus she didntreally take that into account at the moment lily continued to walk around and then suddenly froze in her tracks there was the werewolf sniffing around and then he noticed lily he started walking towards her sniffing her scent lily still couldntmove she was too scared but she thought maybe she could get through to remus r remus it m me it lily i know you are i in there somewhere she said in not more then a whisper nothing it appeared that remus was nowhere inside the werewolf he kept coming closer to her and still she couldntmove then he let out an enormous howl lily screamed and he was about to attack her that was until out of nowhere a stag came and pushed the werewolf down lily was in complete shock it took her a minute to realize that the stag was james lily covered her mouth with her hands and let out a small shriek as she saw the stag and the werewolf fighting she was about to reach for her wand but then a big black dog came and distracted the werewolf from the stag the werewolf then chased the dog off into the distance and there lay the stag on the grass wounded james turned back to his human state but he was still lying on the ground lily quickly ran up to him and knelt down next to him on the ground oh my gosh james are you alright lily said very worried i m i fine are you okay james asked am i okay you saved my life the werewolf attacked you are you hurt lily asked i think i fine james said but then winced from pain lily let out a little shriek james look at your side you re bleeding bad i have to get you to the hospital wing lily said trying to help james up no really lily i fine james said trying to get up but wincing again from the pain you most certainly are not fine lily said really worried the werewolf had bitten the side of his torso and his robes were now blood soaked lily tried again to help james up but he let out a little cry of pain in the process oh james i so sorry she said a couple tears trickling down her cheeks lily then saw someone running up to them it was sirius prongs are you okay sirius said running up to james side he hurt lily said pointing to his wounds quick lily go get madame pomfrey i ll stay here sirius said no sirius you go get her you can run faster i ll stay

fine james said now is not the time to be mr strong high and mighty lean your head on this lily said james did as he was told he did really want to in the first place but just as lily suspected he was trying to be mr strong high and mighty thanks he said lily put her hand on his forehead you seem really cold she said and then noted his side and you are loosing a lot of blood poor moony is having a tough night james said now saying stuff like that makes you seem less self centered lily said james just looked at her i only joking lily said lily then stood up and looked around where is sirius lily said he better hurry up the pain was really starting to sink in now and james was noticing it a lot dontworry james i see him lily said finally james was in the hospital wing and was being taken care of is remus going to be okay lily asked sirius as the waited in the hospital wing should be fine he always is we got him here just after we got james here sirius said dontworry lily sirius said he could tell by the look on her face that she was really worried about james and remus this night was nothing much worse has happened he said oh now that makes me feel so much better lily said sarcastically after a while sirius decided that it was time for him to leave okay lils i beat i dontusually stay here that long sirius said i heading on out you gonna come he asked no thanks i ll wait just a bit longer just to make sure that they are alright lily said sirius smiled and headed out i can see why james loves you so much sirius said but too soft for lily to make out every word what she asked nothing he said but then paused he might as well tell her i said i can see why james loves you so much lily just blushed and looked down come on lily i know you love him too something happened that shouldnthave if anything you should be all pissed at leslie sirius said dontyou think i am lilly said well then why take it out on james you mean the world to him it tearing him apart not being

he loves you lily you love him too give him another shot sirius said and then left lily thought deeply about what sirius had said wow when he wants to be sirius can be quite insightful lily thought to herself lily got up the courage and walked into where james bed was she passed through the curtains and saw that he was sleeping she walked over to him and put her hand on his cheek james started to

just nodded she broke up with you james said not quite understanding sirius nodded again oh that right you two are marauders and no one ever dumps you you always have to dump the girls no one ever rejects you well except me but never mind lily said lils stop it james said now realizing how upset sirius was sorry lily said so why did she break up with you james asked she said that she was confused and scared or some kind of rubbish sirius said you should talk to her lily said sirius just scratched his head and was at a loss of words wow lily thought sirius is never this way with girls he must really like alyssa i guess i could talk to her for you if you want lily said really thanks lily you re the best sirius said lily smiled well we better be going transfiguration starts soon she said yeah james said heading out of the heads room uh uh uh lily said you are staying you need to rest james gave a childish look a disappointment wait did you two sirius began to ask bye james lily said and gave him a quick peck on the lips she then pushed sirius to go and headed towards transfiguration sirius looked back at james who gave him a wink and then sirius smiled glad that at least those two were back together hey remus lily said walking into transfiguration okay sirius you work with remus i ll go talk to alyssa lily said what remus said what happened with alyssa but lily didnthear the end of that because she headed over to alyssa and taking the seat next to her sirius sent you didnthe alyssa said as lily sat down next to her no actually i volunteered lily said oh alyssa said why did you break up with him lily asked but before alyssa could answer professor mcgonagall started talking okay class we are transforming tea cups into teapots although this might sound easy the tea cups and teapots are extremely touchy begin mcgonagall said great where james when you need him lily mumbled sorry alyssa said not catching what lily said nothing now why did you break up with sirius lily asked well i guess she began to say i guess i just got scared that he would just dump me like every other girl he has gone out with alyssa said i see lily said yeah and i mean i just couldntstand that cause i really like him so i figured that i would do it first to save my own heart break she said alyssa sirius really cares about you he wasntabout to break up with you lily said he wasn t alyssa asked no of course not lily said quick mcgonagall is coming over try to transform it alyssa attempted to transform the teacup to a teapot and it turned into more of a creamer not bad miss reynolds but try to focus a bit more it coming alone thanks professor alyssa said once she walked away lily said okay that was close yeah so you really think that sirius likes me and isntjust using me like he has done before alyssa said positive lily said i have never seen him act this way before usually he brags about who he is going out with but now he is nervous a lot but really happy or at least he was until you broke up with him lily said oh alyssa said so what should i do she asked just talk to him tell him what you told me and then i bet he will tell you something on the lines of what i told you only in small words and less confusing you know guy talk lily said alyssa asked thanks lily thanks a lot lily smiled no problem lily then attempted to transform the teacup but it just became slightly larger uh lily said with dissatisfaction so what happened with you and james alyssa asked well i got mad at him for something which turns out not to have been his fault so we are back together now lily said well that good alyssa said you two make the cutest couple really you think lily asked definitely alyssa said you can just tell how much james love you by the way he looks at you really lily asked absolutely alyssa said well i dontknow how to put it in words exactly but in a general sense sirius is crazy for you lily said alyssa smiled so you dontthink that he is just going out with me for the heck of it she asked no way he has never liked someone as much as he likes you lily said i really hope so cause when i first realized that i liked sirius i felt like such a loony alyssa said why lily asked because every other girl well you know a whole lot of them are all ga ga over him and i felt like one of his followers not that i followed him you know alyssa said yeah i get it but trust me he really likes you you arentlike just any other girl to him truly lily said thanks lily thanks a lot i ll i ll talk to him later alyssa said good lily said they continued on with transformation and then very soon it was time to go lily said goodbye to alyssa and then bolted out of transfiguration to tell sirius the good news you are kidding me lils sirius said overcome with joy nope that why she broke up with you so talk to her later and it will all be right as rain lily said thanks a bunch sirius said no problem lily said sirius put his arm around her shoulders and said so what this i hear about you and jamsie boy sirius asked did you forgive him are you back together or are these just rumors sirius asked playfully lily laughed now now i dontthink that it your place in asking lily said and i dontthink that that is your place to put your arm either james voice came from behind them sirius looked behind them and gave a smile oh prongs has decided to join us has he sirius said why yes i have james said lifting sirius arm off of lily and placing his arm around her instead why are you down here lily asked shouldntyou be resting lily asked oh how sweet lillian is deeply concerned about her boyfriend sirius said james disregarded sirius comment i went to the hospital wing and took my last dose of medicine james said i perfectly better now good lily said yeah um sorry about that remus said to james no worries mate james said they walked for a bit heading towards the great hall and then kendall came up next to lily excuse me james could i steal lily away for just a moment kendall said in a playful tone alright by me james said lifting his arm off of lily kendall grabbed lily away the two friends linked arms and whispered among each other kendall was just asking for details about the whole incident what are we whispering about ladies sirius asked edging over kendall pushed him back oh for goodness sakes black you are such a child kendall said they arrived to the great hall and took their old seating peter was there when then arrived and they took their seets remus sat next to peter and kendall sat next to remus across from them sirius sat down james next to him lily next to james things were good again well almost good not too much later after they sat down alyssa came up to the group um sirius c c can i talk to you for a minute she asked sure he said alyssa started to head out of the great hall sirius got up and james patted him on the back good luck james said thanks sirius said and caught up with alyssa up in the gryffindor common room yup i saw them snogging outside peter wins remus said james and remus slowly handed peter 5 galleons each hah i was right guys i told you it would take less than a week peter said why does wormtail always have to be the optimist james said a bit later peter was reading a book in a chair by the fire lily was sitting on james lap in one of the chairs and kendall and remus were sitting next to each other on the couch across from james and lily the two couples were talking as sirius and alyssa walked in lovely seeing you again james said we thought you were dead hardy har har sirius said alyssa blushed the two sat down on one of the couches and everyone talked for a while the discussion of what was going to be on the newts faded quickly and went more into the new issue of witch weekly this all ended with a pillow fight and everyone heading off to bed sirius remus and peter headed for the boys dormitory kendall and alyssa headed for the girls dormitory and james and lily headed out of the gryffindor common room on their way to the heads room with a good night kiss james and lily went off to bed and it goes without saying that everyone had pleasant dreams that night disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 17 a different side of lily uh this is so frustrating lily said sitting on one of the couches in the heads room studying for her newts what james asked sitting next to her how am i supposed to remember all of this stuff i ll do fine in charms but this transfiguration stuff is so difficult lily said calm down you ll do fine you always do james said lily just let out a groan and plopped her head down on the pile of books in her lap doooooo you want me to help you james asked no it fine you already helped me enough with transfiguration i hopeless lily said her head still face down on her pile of books not like that james said then like what lily said not realizing james hinting as soon as she lifted her head off of her book pile james full on kissed her lily was very surprised but also very happy she let out a little moan as james kissed her and she ran her fingers through his hair as he pushed her back a little further on the couch she didntcare a bit that her books had fallen off of her lap and were now sprawled across the floor after a while james finally pulled back lily eyes were still closed and when she opened them her eyes met james james was looking at her smiling still kind of on top of her and said now did that help james asked still smiling very much lily said well are you still feeling a bit overwhelmed james asked lily caught his hinting this time maybe a little she said smiling james gave a big grin and then kissed her again after a while lily realized how late it was getting so she broke away james it getting late we have class she said come on lils lets not go this time we ll just tell them we had head duties or something james said and then started kissing lily again lily kissed back and was about to give into temptation but the good girl in her got the best of her james no she said breaking away again it transfiguration again today and i really need to be there oh alright james said sitting and then standing up lily then stood up but as she was doing so she knocked an ink bottle over and it spilled on her oh merlin lily said as she saw her ink stained robes uh i better go change i ll meet you down there she said i can wait for you james said no it alright i ll meet you down there lily said okay james said and headed out of the heads room lily walked into her room and changed into a new set of robes she then brushed her hair it having gotten messy from recent events down in front of the transfiguration room james was talking with sirius and remus and kendall and alyssa were talking then to a great misfortune a certain leslie medston was heading towards james uh james alyssa said what james said his hand immediately reaching for his hair messing it up thinking lily might be coming alyssa just eyed behind him and james turned around james jumped a bit not expecting to see leslie standing just a few inches from him he quickly took a step back making sure that previous events dontrepeat themselves hey james leslie said please get away from me james said not wanting to sound mean but he said it rather forcefully oh what wrong leslie said please stay away from me i have a girlfriend and i dontlike you james said oh come on evans why are you even going out with someone like her leslie said because she not a trollop like you sirius said leslie disregarded him i know you like me leslie said edging towards james james was backing up i like lily and i would never go out with you james said oh yeah leslie said well i dontsee evans anywhere do you someone just taped leslie on the shoulder and she turned around looking for me lily said and then she slapped leslie across the face james eyes widened he was so shocked at what lily just did way to go lils sirius yelled sirius alyssa hissed looks like little miss lily has a bit of an edge to her after all leslie said and then slapped her back sirius started bouncing around the hallway saying catfight catfight padfoot remus yelled and ran over to sirius making him stop lily was about to lunge at leslie but james caught her at her shoulders and held her back james let go of me lily said struggling to get out of his grasp lils no james said still holding her back dontstoop to her level she needs to pay lily said still trying to get out of james hold on her thank goodness that james was a quittitch player or he might not have been strong enough to hold her back lily was putting up quite a fight lily lily stop kendall said coming over to lily i not going to let her get away with this again you know what happened last time lily said still struggling lily it not worth it james said james is right lily donteven bother she not worth it kendall said maybe not to you lily said and then broke out of james grip ran towards leslie and gave her another huge slap leaving a red handprint on her face you little b leslie started to yell and she was about to hit her back but lily was quicker than her lily grabbed leslie hand and shoved it back donteven think about it lily said lily was about to slap leslie again but james ran back up to lily and pulled her away lily lunged again but james held a tighter grip around her waist and pulled her back further lils come on you dontwant to do this james said wrong lily said moony tell mcgonagall that lily isntfeeling good so i took her up to her room james said to remus sure mate remus said james dragged lily down the hallway a few hallways down lily almost got out of james grip so he picked her up and carried her the rest of the way to the heads room lily what wrong with you james asked lily had given up on trying to get away james was far too strong i sick of being a push over i needed to give that little excuse of a person a piece of my mind for once lily said lily you arenta push over james said you know what the right thing to do is and you do it he said maybe from your point of view lily said in a very nasty tone james put lily down fine then james said go on go run back and give her a piece of your mind he said go on go get a detention go ruin everything that you have worked for i not stopping you james said and then started to walk away lily didntmove it was if james had just suddenly slapped some sense into her james lily said but james kept walking james please lily said catching up to james you re right i shouldnthave done that she said james stopped no lily you shouldnthave it was my problem to handle not yours but i couldntlet her do that to you again look what happened to us last time i broke up with you last time because of her i couldntlet that happen again lily said james stopped and turned to look at her he could tell by the sincerity in her voice that she really was concerned i know lily i know james said that just wasntlike you to go up to her and slap her i know lily said feeling ashamed and we know magic what if she got really pissed and did some kind of horrible spell to you like snape did i wouldntbe able to live with myself if she hurt you i know lily said i i sorry i guess the bad side of me came through and i just couldntcontrol it lily said i didnteven know that you had that kind of side in you james said i could barely hold onto you you have quite a lot of strength in the tiny bit that is you james said lily smiled feeling good that james called her skinny in different words of course and that he complimented her on her strength it was wrong of me to do that lily said do you forgive me of course james said i could never be angry with you lily just gave him a look hinting that he was just pretty mad at her a couple minutes ago well never for more then 5 minutes james said lily grinned and james leaned down and kissed her they then started walking towards the heads room when they were just about there sirius bolted over to them oh miss evans he said to lily yes she said i now have a new found respect for you did you see that mark on medston face brilliant sirius said um thanks lily said not quite sure how to respond it sure was nice of you to go bouncing around the halls advertising the little dispute james said in a quite sarcastic tone what can i say sirius said you can say but lily cut him off uh sirius i think that someone is waiting for you lily said noting the end of the hallway where alyssa was standing right then i shall be off sirius said he met alyssa at the end of the hallway and the two turned the corner and were out of site what a loony james said the two then entered the heads room right i have to clean up this mess lily said talking about all of her books that were still sprawled across the floor james gave a little laugh remembering earlier before and how her books ended up on the floor what lily asked as she was picking up her books oh nothing just thinking about stuff james said right lily said knowing that there was more to it but she just shrugged it off kind of wish you would have stayed here instead of going to class now dontyou james said not really lily said james just gave a puzzled look i know what i did was wrong but it was oh so satisfying lily said with a smile james laughed guess i cantblame you it really was quite satisfying james said lily picked up all of her books and brought them to the desk in her room lily then came out of her room hey james can you come here i wanna show you something she asked james sure he said lily then went into her room and james soon followed lily laid down on her bed and stared up at the canopy what did you want to show me james asked come here lily said and patted the empty space next to her on her bed james hesitated for a minute and then went over lie down and then look up lily said james still a little hesitant did as she said wow lily bed is comfortable james

how he did it chapter 18 planning they just laid there on lily bed for a while lily staring at her enchanted canopy james staring at her and then eventually lily fell asleep james then tucked her in kissed her forehead and then left her room closing her door james wished that he could just stay there forever next to her watching her sleep and then falling asleep next to her but james knew lily better it would completely freak her out if she woke up and he was next to her so alas james went into his room and fell asleep the instant his head touched his pillow the next morning lily woke up from a refreshing nights sleep and got up showered and got ready for the day it was very late lily had completely missed breakfast and it was almost lunchtime lily finished getting ready and left her room she had to talk with james today about the farewell ball only for seventh years and they had to plan it lily had a feeling that james was still sleeping so she went over and knocked on his door she heard a bit of a moan but no response otherwise yep he was in there still sleeping lily let herself in went over to his bed sat down on the edge of it and gave him a bit of a shake james she said no response james come on you have to get up it lunchtime still no response oh come on she said then lily had an idea this will wake you up she then leaned down and kissed him on the lips his eyes opened and he kissed her back taking her by surprise lily then broke away hey you were awake this whole time werentyou she asked maybe i just wanted to see what you would do james said with a sparkle in his eye lily laughed and then kissed him again but this time he pulled her down from her sitting position to a laying position so that she was on top of him and began kissing her some more after a while she broke away and rested her chin on his chest how can you do that she asked do what love he asked just sweep me off my feet like that at any moment you choose she said james grinned just the potter charm he said lily gave out a small laugh you are just too full of yourself she said and then leaned back down and kissed james again james was in heaven he was still in bed lily was on top of him and they were kissing james just went with the moment after a bit more snogging lily felt herself melting into james she knew that she had to go but didntcare all she wanted was to stay there in his arms james hand slowly started moving up lily back along her creamy skin lily was lost in the moment and was completely giving in when lily realized how far james hand was up her back not that she didntlike it she reached back pulled his hand back down and broke away come on we have a meeting with mcgonagall lily said she gave him a quick kiss on the mouth and then hopped off of his bed and skipped out of the room james slightly cursed under his breath partially at himself getting a little to close to lily likings that she broke away and for lily breaking away he wanted to stay right there forever but he got up got dressed and met lily in the heads common room i dontunderstand how guys get dressed so fast lily said as james came out well we dontreally give a flying rats arse about how we look james said lily just eyed him and well you know i always look just smashing donti james said in a partial kidding way lily rolled her eyes and they both headed out of the heads room in mcgonagall office as you two know you will be planning the farewell ball it will be held in a week and a half after newts are over mcgonagall said lily and james both nodded i know that it is not that far away so i hope that you two have been doing some planning she said james eyes widened he didntplan anything of course professor i have a few ideas and i almost have it narrowed down to one lily said james just looked over at her and was so thankful that lily planned ahead excellent miss evans mcgonagall said anything to add mr potter she asked uh nope james said i really like lily ideas he said in a tone trying to convince her mcgonagall just eyed him almost seeing right through him very well you two may go she said james and lily stood up but remember mcgonagall said you will be working alone on this the prefects are not required to help you this being a 7th year ball after all she said dontworry professor we have everything under control lily said assuring her they both left her office and headed outside so what are your plans james asked i donthave any plans lily said what james said am i always the one who has to think of everything lily said well no but you said to mcgonagall james said quite confused i was just bluffing lily said i have been so busy studying for newts that i have barely had time to plan for the ball oh james said well good bluff you had me convinced lily just gave out a small laugh lets go outside and work on it its only a week and a half away she said they both went outside and sat down by one of the trees lily got out some parchment and started writing ideas down james was just daydreaming thinking about the morning and wishing that he was still upstairs with lily how about it is only for the 7th years but they can bring dates from other years is that okay lily said turning to james waking him up from his daydream what huh oh yeah that good good idea james said pretending that he was paying attention the whole time lily just sighed rolled her eyes and went back to work james took out a struggling golden snitch from his pocket and started letting it go and catching it again when it seemed like it was out of reach lily was concentrating on the ball ideas but she was so annoyed with james seeing him out of the corner of her eye ugg lily yelled and grabbed the snitch just as james let it out of his hand again james was a little shocked not expecting lily to react like that will you quit it she yelled it bad enough you arenthelping but at least pretend to help she said and that catching the snitch this is bloody annoying she said james just smiled at her what are you smiling at she asked quite annoyed you love you are very cute when you are angry he said oh dont even start with m she started to say but was cut off james leaned over and kissed her square on the lips lily was very taken back but didntmind so much because she knew that no matter what james probably wasntgoing to help with the ball so what was the use being mad at him are we interrupting something sirius said as he walked over to lily and james with his arm around alyssa james broke away not at all padfoot james said well good then we shall join you sirius said lily gave a little blush said hi to alyssa and went back to work a little while later kendall and remus came over and joined the rest of the group peter had gone into the

maybe even a fourth as good as you and that saying something james said lily laughed god she has a beautiful laugh james thought shall we go he asked her holding out his arm she linked her arm with his we shall she said the three couples went down to the ball where they met peter who was standing near the refreshment table wow you guys did a great job kendall said to lily and james the who place was decorated like an enchanted forest the dance floor looked like a lake so when you were dancing it looked like you were dancing on water there were trees along the edges with bushes and flowers in front of them the ceiling was bewitched to look like the night sky and there were fairy lights on the tables a voice broke through the crowd now everyone please settle down for a moment dumbledore said and everyone hushed i would like to tell you how very pleased i am with all of you you have come so far and i see bright lights in all of your futures he said it has been my greatest pleasure having you all as students and with great sadness i must say goodbye to you this year with all of that in order i wish you the best of luck and if the head boy and girl would start off the first dance

james were dancing thanks for what james asked twirling her around for not giving up on me she said i could never give up on you and i never will james said and you will never have to lily said i will always be yours disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at

how he did it chapter 2 back again in the hospital wing well she took quite a blast good thing ms jackson was there to help her or she would be in a much worse condition madame pomfery said thanks so

watching lily sleep lily please be okay please come on dontleave me here alone wake up james said in a near whisper james was holding lily hand slightly caressing it lily started to stir and then slowly opened her eyes james eyes widened so happy that she was okay j james what are you doing here what am i doing here where are we lily asked oh thank god lily you re okay james said hugging lily lily never wanted him to let her go but then she remembered who was hugging her and she quickly said yes but i still in pain and that not exactly helping oh sorry james said letting her go do you want to stay here or are you ready to go to your room he asked well i dontfancy staying here all night so ill go back to my room but can you help me up lily said sure be careful though james said helping lily up they walked out of the hospital wing lily leaning on james walking to their rooms lily started to turn towards the gryffindor common room but james pulled her the other way we have our own common room and bedrooms now remember because we are heads now james explained lily followed him but then suddenly felt really weak and her knees gave in whoa whoa whoa okay i gonna have to carry you is uh that okay james asked uh well whatever i guess i cantreally walk anymore lily said unsure although she was very happy with the thought wait i excited with potter i mean james carrying me god what wrong with me but he has changed hasnthe james scooped her up and carried her to the heads room they reached sculpture of an angel and then james said truffles and the sculpture slid out of their way and james walked himself and lily into the head common room james had already been to the head common room earlier that day but lily was utterly astonished it was without saying as big as the gryffindor common room and everything was gold there were silver accents like the color of the couches chairs desks and accessories and it in one word sparkled at first lily thought that she was dreaming but when she closed her eyes and then opened them again it was still there oh my lily said still in james arms so you like our common room i taking it james said oh my lily repeated can you put me down james i think i okay to walk now she asked to james disappointment he helped her down to her feet sure wait until you see the rooms you will go even crazier james said lily walked over to a door with a gold plaque that said lily evans head girl on it james stayed closely behind her just to make sure she didntfall again and they walked into her room james hesitated at the door not sure if he was welcome but then lily said it okay you can come in if the room is this great i might as well have some one to be excited with lily had dark wood furniture everywhere and it was accented with pink and green her bed was a canopy bed with a light green comforter and soft pink pillows all of her belongings were brought up and she had a huge bookshelf with all of her favorite books on it lily was so astonished with her room she threw herself on her bead forgetting james was there for a minute and just soaked everything in james began to feel quite awkward and said uh i a bit tired i going to bed g night lily lily came back to her senses and said oh okay good night james then started to leave but then lily quickly added and uh james thanks for before for carrying me and all you really have changed thanks lily said with a soft smile james beamed sure anytime only you know dontget cursed or hurt or anything cause it not fun to see you in pain like that lily smiled and nodded and then james left closing her door behind him he waited out there for a couple minutes just hearing her breathe was a blessing for him knowing that she was alive and they were friends then he went off to bed and needless to say they both had sweet dreams the next day lily thank goodness you are all right james told remus that you were alright and remus told me but i just had to know for myself kendall said hugging lily yes i fine but you are cutting off my breathing here lily said gasping for air when kendall let her go oh sorry so how is the head room i heard it was to die for kendall asked it brilliant you have to come see it some time and thanks for before if it wasntfor you i would be in a much worse condition lily said oh donteven say that what did you think i was gonna do leave you there that what friends are for kendall said smiling they sat down for breakfast and were soon joined by the marauders remus of course sat down next to kendall then sirius and peter took seats across from lily and kendall james then came um next to lily and said er um do you mind if i sit here james asked pointing at the empty space next to lily uh sure lily said and then started eating james tried not to show it but he was extremely happy he tried very hard to keep a grin from spreading across his face sirius saw this and eyed him strangely james kicked him under the table and then they both laughed everyone just looked at them and they eventually stopped so prongs how the heads room sirius asked oh it brilliant padfoot just brilliant james said why do you guys call each other that lily asked they froze james started to try and find his words but sirius cut him off and said well darling lillian why so interested dontyou have little inside jokes with your friends that you dontfeel like sharing whatever lily said ugh transfiguration first class i really stink in that class i dontget how you guys get straight o in that class that is the only class that i do miserable in james and sirius just looked at each other remus would have looked too but he was once again busy with kendall being anamagius james and sirius were outstanding in transfiguration but they couldntuse that as an excuse otherwise lily and kendall would find out remus was having trouble enough keeping his werewolf secret from kendall james and sirius couldntlet anyone know well we just happen to have our one strong point as you have your many sirius responded yeah i guess lily said but i still suck at it and that well sucks uh i could help you if you want james said lily was a bit shocked james

partner james asked lily quickly spun around facing james quite alarmed that he heard her she then scanned the class and she had no choice looks like i have no choice lily said not quite in a mean way just stating the facts james and lily sat down next to each other and started working after a while lily rock was a leafy blob definitely not a flower uhg lily yelled this is so frustrating i never going to get it why canti get this calm down lily you have to act like you want the rock to be a flower it more then just saying the incantation you have to want it to be a flower and you have to feel it becoming a flower uhhhhhhhhhhh lily sighed fine try it again james said she did this time it became not a flower but a stem with a bud on it close but not quite there that was much better really you are starting to get it james said encouraging her i really dontfeel like doing this anymore you go ahead and do it lily said james did it and the rock turned into a beautiful luscious lily lily eyes widened wow she said james picked up the lily and held it towards her for you he said oh james i couldnttake it it your flower you did it i dontdeserve it lily said of course you do it beautiful just like you he said lily blushed why am i blushing she thought to herself this is potter well james now but still why would i blush for something he did lily started to search for words as she took the flower but to her luck it was time to go and she quickly rushed out of the classroom james sighed and watched her go sirius then came up next to him and put his hand on james shoulder you got it bad for her mate sirius said yeah james said sill looking at the door which lily had just left disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has

being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 20 farewell ball part 2 james almost couldntbelieve his ears he gave a big grin and kissed her softly on the lips once he broke away he twirled her around and then dipped her she was laughing and once he pulled her back up they both smiled shortly after the song ended do you want some punch james asked sure lily said and the walked over to the refreshments table having fun lily asked kendall as she and remus walked over to them very kendall said and i saw you having some fun yourself she said but out of james earshot lily just gave her a kind of annoyed smile and then they both laughed soon peter sirius and alyssa joined them and they all sat down at one of the tables all of them were talking and having a blast a little later a slow song came on and james stood up may i have this dance he said holding his had out for lily to take you may she said taking his hand and standing up soon after remus asked kendall to dance sirius and alyssa decided to sit this one out and stay to talk with peter the two couples were dancing along with many others lily had her head rested on james shoulder and her arms around his neck and james had his arms around lily waist this has been the best night ever james whispered to lily lily looked up at him her arms still around his neck why she asked cause i am here with you and we are dancing james said lily smiled well we danced at the last ball not like this james said lily just gave him a confused look then the song ended this time you are officially mine james said as they started to head off of the dance floor lily would have start to put up some kind of argument but james silenced her with a long kiss when he pulled away lily eyes were still closed but when she opened them and looked up at him she met his eyes and his smile come on i want to show you something james said grabbed her hand and led her to the garden although confused lily followed without a word when they were almost at the garden lily said james when are we going you ll see james said he then put his hands over her eyes and led her outside james lily said in a worried tone what are you doing this is all too familiar come on trust me james said last time i surprised you it was a very good surprise wasntit yeah lily said well then trust me james said oh fine lily said james led her out to the garden and then when she was in the right place he removed his hands from over her eyes lily let out a gasp and put her hands over her mouth you asked me to make the garden look nice didntyou james said remembering when lily told him what his jobs for the ball were and he did just as she had said and maybe a bit more i completely forgot lily said still astounded do you like it james asked do i do i like it lily said i love it it beautiful i glad james said grinning james had set up the garden with every kind of flower imaginable and some that you couldntimagine there was a fountain spurting out glowing water all of the trees surrounding them had fireflies in them and not just a few they were lit up like christmas trees with them it was like a firefly show lily turned to james put her arms around his neck and gave him a huge hug you are the greatest she said james kissed her forehead not as great as you he said then he grabbed her hand and said come on there is still one more thing oh my she said and followed along with him he pulled her along for a while and then they reached a hill james then let go of her hand and laid down what are you doing she asked come on lay down he said lily was confused but did as he asked she looked up and saw the night sky with millions trillions of stars in the sky lily gasped it like your canopy only real james said lily just looked up in awe she then moved over closer to james and laid down right next to him he put his arm around her and they laid there i couldntthink of a better way to end my last night at hogwarts lily said james smiled and then looked at her i could he said lily gave him a confused look james then leaned over and kissed lily he leaned over more so he was slightly above her she ran her hand through his hair as he kissed her and there they were there last night at hogwarts kissing under the stars a n thanks for all of the reviews guys yes i know it was all fluff but i canthelp it hope you like it review please disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 21 the time is now lily stood in her doorway taking one last look at her room with a sigh she took her trunk out and closed the door behind her it was the last time she would ever be at hogwarts she plopped her trunk down near the door where it would soon magically appear on the train and then slumped down on the couch she wiped a tear from her eye realizing how much she would miss hogwarts and how good it had been to her she sat with her arms crossed and tears slowly falling down her cheeks taking in the past 7 years thinking about where she was then and where she is now particularly on the james subject how she loathed him then and she loved him now james came out of his room with his trunk to see a crying lily on the couch lils what wrong he asked james was very excited to be going unlike lily lily was immediately snapped out of her thoughts she looked up at him tears still in here eyes huh lily why are you crying what wrong james said coming and sitting down next to her i i cantbelieve it over she said but why be sad about it we are starting the rest of our lives now shouldntit be exciting not sad he said hogwarts has been my home it a scary thought for me knowing that i not coming back she said but you still have your whole life ahead of you james said lily turned to him i donthave a huge home to go back to like you do she said i live in a muggle world and yes of course i love my parents to death but my sister god she is horrible and she is getting married i donthave that much going for me right away when i get back she said james started to understand now he had always had the luxury of a huge house magical family lots of money no siblings always getting what he wanted lily had none of this well you know what they say when one door closes another one opens james said trying his hardest to be helpful lily looked him deep in the eyes he had a small smile on she could tell that he was really trying to make her feel better she quickly stood up wiped the tears from her eyes and said yeah you re right no need to get upset it stupid to cry over something like this james then stood up lily it never stupid to cry if you need to cry the worst thing to do is hold it in he said lily was standing with her hands over her mouth and nose trying to hold in her tears that were trying to get out within one swift movement she turned and leaned on james shoulder and started letting out huge sobs i need to cry she said between sobs james just hugged her as she cried on his shoulder everything i know is here she said and then between sobs she started to say all of my friends are here sob my whole life is here sob and then in a smaller voice you re here james took a step back and put his hands on lily shoulders lily everything will be fine i promise and i not going anywhere he said lily looked up into his eyes hers still tear filled but but how do you know things arentgoing to change what i if i drift apart from everything and loose it all she asked because i wontlet them change james said lily gave him a big hug i dontwant to loose you she said in a whisper lily you will never loose me he said after a minute or two james decided to try to lift lily spirits listen lily i think that right now your friends need you down stairs the graduation ceremony is going to be very soon and you need to be down there why dontwe celebrate all the good things that have happened and worry about the rest later james said hopefully lily backed away you re right it a time to celebrate she said that it is james said lily wiped away her tears and smiled come on i sure everyone is waiting and we wouldntwant a sad head girl now would we james said lily let out a small laugh james grabbed her hand and they both headed for the great hall in the great hall james and lily sat down next to their friends at the gryffindor table and chatted for a while until silenced by the headmaster to end this year i would like to personally thank you all for being such wonderful students it has been a most wonderful year and i hope all of you enjoy your summers professor dumbledore

together in a compartment on the train throughout the train ride they shared stories from the past years had many laughs ate some candy and had a blast there were a few snogging sessions in the bathrooms mostly by kendall and remus and then the train finally arrived at platform 9 they boarded off the train and passed with their trunks through the platform lily ran with her stuff up to her

head off holding onto his had as long as she could and then letting go she turned heading for her parents car until she stopped when she heard someone calling her name lily james yelled running up to her lily turned around you didntthink i was going to let you leave without a good by kiss did you he asked grinning lily smiled back james then pulled her close giving her a long passionate kiss

saw petunia hey petunia she said petunia just glared at her congratulations on your engagement lily said trying to be nice even though petunia hated her mostly because she was a witch thanks petunia said coldly how are you freak friends she asked with no interest what so ever they are great lily said going along with it there was no use fighting in fact i should be getting a few owls from them right now petunia let out a disgusted noise and went downstairs lily sighed and went to her room she put her trunk at the foot of her bed and laid down on top of her bed she was just thinking about random things when she was awaken from her day dream by a tapping lily immediately jumped up and went to her window it was an owl but as she let the owl in she was a bit confused she had never seen this owl before she was used to the brown barn owl that kendall would always send her letters with but this owl was snowy white she gave the owl a pet said thank you and then took the letter the owl didntleave though i guess he was directed to wait for a response lily thought she then opened the letter it was from james dearest lily i told you i would write as soon as i got home and so i am how

best time would be when she gets back all my love lily she rolled up the parchment attached it to the owl and the owl took off lily took out a book and started reading not too soon after that her

james owl again lily was a little confused she sent him a response i wonder what else he wants lily thought as she let the owl in dear lily well maybe when your sister is getting ready and everything

a little party wouldntthat be smashing well let me know when you can my owl will wait again if you like still missing you love james lily laughed he was one to get excited lily put his letter with his previous one and headed downstairs hey mum lily said as she went down to the kitchen where petunia oh she is over at vernon s mrs evans said oh lily said this seemed like a good time to ask about going to james house i have a question she started would it be alright to stay at james house for a bit when petunia is getting ready for her wedding we all know she doesntwant me around and kendall is going to be there her mother finished putting the dishes away and then turned to her is this the james potter that tried for years asking you to go out with him and this year he finally won your

house and stay a few nights mrs evans asked yes lily said mrs evans just looked at her oh come on mum i am 17 almost 18 years old you can trust me to make my own decisions mrs evans sighed oh i guess

him she was so excited to see him again james was so happy to see her and even more happy when she started running over to him lily ran up to him threw her arms around his neck and gave him a huge

bathing suit from under lily she held it up it was a dark green with a kris cross back but it was a one piece and kendall was not pleased what the hell is this kendall said my bathing suit lily said shyly kendall let out a huge sigh why would you wear something like this to a pool party when your boyfriend is there kendall asked that exactly why i wearing it lily said trying to snatch it back but

bikini it wont make any difference lily took a deep breath okay okay i good i good lily said trying to give herself some confidence yes you are now go kendall said pushing lily through the back doors leading to the pool as soon as lily was outside she saw sirius remus some other guys from hogwarts and james lily eyes immediately widened oh god i cantdo this she said turning around trying to get

lily james thinks your beautiful weather you are wearing a one piece or a bikini alyssa said trying to cheer lily up so why canti be wearing a one piece then she said still being forced to walk over with them because kendall said we know he really wants to see you in a bikini lily just looked at her in disbelief when they finally got over to where the boys were lily had an idea alyssa and kendall said hi and then lily said hey um i have to go to the bathroom i ll be right back then she started to walk back to the house but kendall grabbed her arm through a forced smile kendall said are you sure you have to go right now positive lily said also through a forced smile and yanked her arm back lily headed back and kendall just turned back to everyone and sighed what remus asked lily she is a strange one kendall said remus sirius and james just looked at her she embarrassed to be seen in a bikini alyssa said why sirius asked jamsie here already saw her with a wet white shirt on sirius said laughing yeah well that didntexactly help matters alyssa said sort of harsh to sirius she really embarrassed because of me james asked kendall yeah and well i suppose everyone else but mostly you i guess kendall said how d you get her to wear a bikini then sirius asked with a hint of humor in his voice kendall transfigured her one piece into a bikini alyssa said sirius let out a huge bark of laughter the look on her face must have been priceless sirius said james punched him in the shoulder sirius pretended to be mortally wounded and stumbled back and took a fall into the pool everyone chuckled and rolled their eyes so why would she be embarrassed to be in a bikini in front of me james asked dunno alyssa said lily is a strange one and remember what happened at last year pool party

small laugh take cover james said grabbed lily hand and they both jumped in the pool alyssa didntreally get it she doesntknow about remus being a werewolf but she jumped in anyway sirius then pulled

skipped about like a little girl and followed her after going in a few rooms one room in particular caught lily attention ooh she said heading into the music room you have a music room she said that

good song and then you will know how it souds heehe james looked at her as she played he noticed how serious she looked when she was playing and how she seemed to be really into it when she finished he was still staring at her what she asked james just smiled that was beautiful he said lily slightly blushed and smiled shyly thanks she said james was just about to lean over and kiss her when there was suddenly a loud boom they both jumped and within a split second the sky opened up and it started raining damn thunder storms james said lily tapped him on the nose as she said naughty naughty boy james just laughed what he said thunder storms are the best lily said because that means rain and you know what rain means a hell of a good time james said having his spirits brightened remembering that him and lily had their first kiss outside in the rain that right lily said and it isntcold this time lily said knowing exactly what james was thinking james smiled come on then i in the mood for a bit of a dance in the rain lily said then she got up and ran to the back doors and out to the backyard lily threw her arms up in the air and started twirling around come on then lily yelled through the noisy rain join the fun james just laughed one day lily could be too shy to go swimming and the next she was bold and outrageous dancing in the rain james then went up to her put his arms around her waist lifted her up a bit and started twirling her around lily tilted her head back and put her arms back letting the rain fall down all over her as james spun her around when he finally put her down she looked up at him and they gazed into each other eyes james was mystified by her dancing emerald eyes and lily was pulled into his hazel eyes sirius had just gotten back from bringing alyssa home and he was about to yell hey prongsie having a bit of a romp are we but he saw the way that james and lily were looking at each other and then went into the house without them even noticing lily and james continued to stare into each other eyes until james couldnttake it anymore and he leaned down and kissed her after a minute lily broke away and said hey last time we were out dancing in the rain i got kiss you not the other way around james smiled i think it only fair if i get to do it again she said my mistake james said with a smile go right on ahead lily smiled and then she kissed him so there they were kissing in the rain once again james holding lily close lily holding herself even closer note yes i know that they already danced in the rain and whatnot but who gets tired of dancing in the rain i love the rain and without doubt in my mind music and rain are two of life greatest pleasures disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love

being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 26 the last day and the night before it was lily last day at the potter estate before heading back home in preparation for her sisters wedding preparation that actually involved her that is lily lily get up come on james voice came from very near to lily lily just pulled her covers over her head and held them tight lily come on it is past lunch time you cantsleep forever it your last day here come on james said i need sleep lily said very weekly from under the covers and you have had plenty come on then get up james said i very tired i was up late last night lily said james laughed the night before lily woke up from a click on her window she stood up there it was again lily went to her window and saw that james was throwing rocks up on her balcony doors she opened her balcony doors dodging a rock that came up and leaned over the edge of her balcony what are you doing lily said in a loud whisper come on down james said i want to show you something you re crazy lily said she then took a look inside and then back down and james she saw the eager look on his face and decided to go oh alright i ll be down in a minute she said okay james said with excitement in his voice lily turned to go inside but then stopped when she heard james voice again could you climb down the lattice james asked i dontwant to wake up my parents sure just let me get changed lily said and then went into her room she got changed into jeans a soft yellow top and put her hair in a ponytail lily then went back out to the balcony and james immediately got up from the grass of where he was sitting and waiting lily reached over to the lattice and started climbing down she then looked down and got a knot in her stomach having a deep fear of heights dontworry james said as if he could sense her fear i ll be here to catch you lily took a deep breath and started down again lily was almost at the bottom when she misplaced her foot and then started to fall she would have let out a scream but remember that everyone else was sleeping so she screamed on the inside luckily she was not that far from the ground and as promised james was there to catch her she fell into his arms and let out a breath of relief thank you she said no problem james said putting her down so where are we going lily asked come on i ll show you james said he then grabbed lily hand and they headed towards the woods oh dear lily said are we going in there yup come on james said with a gulp lily followed him into the woods clinging onto him lumos james said holding out his wand for some light they headed deeper into the forest and lily clung onto james tightly where are we going lily asked shh james said we re almost there they soon came to a stream with a bridge going across it they stepped onto the bridge and then stopped midway okay now let me do the talking dontsay anything until i tell you you can james said what lily asked just trust me okay james said okay lily said james smiled and gave her a quick kiss on the lips he then cleared his voice and said hello this is james potter i am here with my girlfriend lily would it be alright if we took a look around lily was madly confused but stayed silent suddenly something floated up from the water and it was glowing lily wasntquite sure what it was it was a fairy you may a voice came from the glowing creature suddenly 9 more fairies came out of the water and started flying around them leaving trails of glowing light until they were enclosed in a golden orb suddenly the orb disappeared and they were somewhere completely different thank you james said lily just looked around in amazement james then turned to her okay you can talk now but what james didntknow was that lily couldnttalk she was at a loss of words they had been transported to some sort of fairy land there was a huge waterfall with rocks and flowers all around it it was no ordinary waterfall though this waterfall was spurting glowing pink water and falling down white rocks there were trees everywhere with unimaginable flowers in them vines reached up every tree and you could barely see the sky with the thickness of the trees everywhere there were glowing lights fairies lily was still speechless pretty neat huh james said lily finally found words how what how did you find this place lily asked in a whisper it okay you donthave to whisper james said lily nodded well when i was a kid i always would explore through the woods james said lily nodded and then one day i came up to the bridge we were on and i just stood there leaning on the edge thinking james continued mostly about you actually james said with a smile lily smiled back so then suddenly just like before a glowing light came up from the water and i was quite taken back it then told me that it had been watching me explore the woods and i seemed like a good enough person in tune with nature and all that jazz lily nodded so it asked me my name i told it and then it asked me if i wanted to see the fairy world naturally i said yes and well here we are i see lily said still taking it all in so this this is fairy land just conveniently in your back yard lily asked yup james said you see fairies sometimes disguise themselves as fireflies so they had watched me for a long time and then decided to let me come in really lily asked yeah so always let fireflies go when you catch them cause it could be a fairy james said lily laughed okay i ll be sure to and then once the trusted me enough and took me here they told me that i could bring one person at a time here it couldntbe very often because they have their lives to live but i could every so often james said they also told me that it has to be someone that i trust and someone who would never share their secret so you chose me lily asked quite flattered of course james said could you imagine taking sirius here he would destroy everything lily laughed no really of course i chose you you can always be trusted james said lily smiled you wonttell right james asked just making sure of course i won t lily said good james said now come on you have to see something james then took lily hand and headed into the forest they came across many fairies of which they said hello to and finally reached a break in the woods there was a white gazebo with morning glory twisted all around it wow lily said yeah james said they made it for the humans that come here it has all kind of magics on it he continued you feel really energized when you step in it and if you are sick it heals you right up but overall it just makes you feel good really lily asked yup james said want to try he asked sure lily said james then held out his hand lily took it and then stepped onto the gazebo lily felt a tingling sensation go all through her body she instantly felt energized and very happy she looked over at james who was smiling at her pretty neat huh james asked it amazing lily said it feel like as if energy just past right through you james finished for her exactly lily said they just gazed at each other feeling so uplifted from the magical gazebo lily turned to look at the trees and noticed a lot of light well a lot more light then before james what time is it lily asked i dunno james said why because i am starting to see a lot more light lily said well the time is completely different here james said oh lily said okay but we have been here a while do you think it time to head back james asked oh i dontknow whatever you want i could probably stay here forever lily said with a laugh but i suppose we should get going okay james said they walked off of the gazebo and immediately the energy that they felt was gone excuse me james said to one of the passing fairies yes a voice came from the glowing fairy do you think you could transport us back to the bridge in the human forest james asked but of course the fairy said and within just a moment 9 fairies joined their fellow fairy and began spinning around them just like before before they knew it they were back in the woods that was strange lily said how do they do that magic james said lily smiled and then hugged him thank you so much for taking me there that was the most amazing place i have ever been she said anything for you love james said i canthardly believe that just a few moments ago i was in fairy land lily said one of your childhood fantasies james asked as they headed back to the house isntit every girls lily said james laughed i wouldntknow he said lily laughed when they reached the house they came up to under lily window do you think you can climb back up james asked pretty sure lily said well i ll wait here just incase you fall again james said thanks lily said as she started to climb up the lattice she didntfall or stumble and she safely reached her balcony goodnight james said from below goodnight lily said she then blew him a kiss and james smiled then she went into her room and closed the balcony doors she then collapsed on her bed and immediately fell asleep without changing back to her nightclothes well you cantstay asleep forever james said lily then finally turned facing him and pulled the covers down from over her head oh fine she said james smiled but only because it my last day here lily said she then got up and gave a big stretch and yawn you never changed out of those clothes james asked lily looked down and saw that she was still in the same clothes from last night guess not she said well are you coming down for a late lunch james asked i suppose lily said but once i change james just stood there shoo shoo she said waving her hands towards the door i not changing when you are still in here james sighed a guy can only hope he said lily gave him a look and then he left i ll be down in a moment she said right before he closed the door alright he said closing the door lily then changed into a sundress and let her hair down in soft curls she then met up with james and sirius downstairs and the table where they were eating sirius was stuffing his face like a mad man and lily couldnthelp but laugh after they finished eating james said up for one last swim in the pool okay lily said oh really even after you last episode at the sirius started to say but james kicked him under the table ow sirius yelped what the bloody hell was that for james just looked at him telling him to shut up well i not the on who mooned us all lily said james was happy that lily didntappear to be embarrassed like last time well jamsie here started a whole take cover act with moony sirius said there was silence and then everyone laughed lily stood up i ll go get changed she said me too james said standing up same here sirius said and the three of them headed upstairs kendall had transfigured lily other bathing suit to a green bikini with black straps and edges for some reason lily didntfeel shy anymore good thing some sense was slapped into her she changed and met james and sirius outside who were already in the pool lily jumped in and they played volleyball in the pool sirius was out of luck he was no match for james and lily on one team after a while sirius gave up alright alright no fair i give up sirius said getting out of the pool where are you going james asked oh i going in i all pruney it ruining my perfect complexion sirius said james and lily laughed sirius then gave a wink at james and then looked at lily james then widened his eyes knowing what his friend was silently saying to him looked at lily and back at sirius sirius just laughed and walked away after knowing him for my whole life i still dontunderstand him sometimes james said i dontget how you understand him most of the times lily said james laughed do you wanna go in the hot tub james aked ooh you have a hot tub lily said very excited sure do james said getting out of the pool lily following him they walked over away from the pool to find a hot tub james took the cover off and then lily jumped excitedly and got in i take it you like hot tubs james said as he climbed in yeah lily said leaning back relaxing i have only been on one once but i love them really james asked yup it was after my cousins wedding we had to stay at a hotel because they live far away and the hotel had one lily said oh james said lily laid back and relaxed for a bit but after a while she sat up straight and looked over at james who was looking at her what she asked as she watched him looking at her james just smiled nothing he said lily eyes him suspiciously but then smiled back james then leaned over and kissed her softly on the lips and then pulled away but lily didnthave enough she leaned over and kissed him deeply on the lips which was a surprise to james that she had come back over to him james pulled her closer touching her exposed back which sent shivers up lily spine but she still didntpull away lily pulled herself closer and raised up a bit so that she was now a little above james james deepened the kiss as he brought his hand up her back unlike last time lily didntrefuse he glided his hand gradually up her back which was wet from the water and eventually moved up to her neck as he combed through her hair she had her hands on his shoulders but moved them back around his neck pressing herself up against him gliding her fingers through his hair sirius came outside calling for lily and james because it was time for lily to leave okay you two lovebirds it time for lillian to head off sirius said james just lifted one hand and waved him away as he continued to kiss lily right then sirius said five more minutes he then walked away laughing lily had packed all of her things and headed downstairs her trunks levitating down behind her as she closed the trunk she turned to face james and sirius sirius came up and gave her a big hug thanks for taking us to the food store he said as he finally released her i had a bloody blast lily laughed no problem she then gave james a big hug thanks for everything she said thanks for coming james said lily smiled gave him a quick kiss goodbye and got into her car she waved out of her window as she pulled away and when the potter estate was out of sight she rolled up her window and headed home

were painted light pink her whole room was very girly she had a white four post bed and a flower bed spread all of her dressers were an antique white with gold trim james went and sat down on lily bed he then noticed that she had the picture of them dancing in the rain on her nightstand just like she did at hogwarts then on her bulletin board she had some pictures of herself and kendall and some of kendall alyssa and some other girls from gryffindor these pictures seemed to cover her bulletin board but then he saw some that appeared to be added on to it later on there was a picture from a quittitch game showing james catching the snitch he realized that this was from the day that he had surprised lily with the array of liles in the heads room there was also a picture of kendall alyssa and lily in their farewell ball gowns and then james favorite a picture of lily and him dancing at the farewell ball james smiled and then he heard lily opening her door he then adverted his attention

but if you would have done that i wouldntget the chance to dance with you later on james said too true lily said james laughed and gave her a hug right before they reached the church doors lily hugged back thanks for being here today she said james gave her a kiss on her forehead anything for you love he said come on we better go before they get started okay lily said with a laugh they walked into the church and took a seat to the right in the middle lily could have sat up front with her parents but decided that it would be safer to sit farther back after the i do from the bride and groom and then the end of the wedding everyone went outside and threw rice at them petunia and vernon got into the limo and then the rest of the parties got into their cars to drive to the reception lily parents were going in one of the limos so once again it was only james and lily as they got in the car james said well that wasntso bad now was it could have been worse lily said agreeing they headed off heading to the reception which was about 30 min away do you want to listen to the radio lily asked the what james asked lily laughed she forgot that james had only been in a car twice she then turned on the radio and james was amazed you can scan through the stations with this lily said pointing to a button on the radio james had no idea what that meant but tried it and he was having a genuine blast this is bloody brilliant james said i have to show this to sirius lily laughed when the arrived to the reception lily turned the radio off and then the car let do this lily said getting out of the car that the spirit james said when the arrived in the building that held the reception they had to wait a bit before they could go in lily sat down on one of the couches in the lobby james

smile i see no chance of an extra chair fitting so we will sit at the bar well alright if you re sure mrs evans said positive lily said lily then dragged james away and over to the bar they both sat down and james looked at lily a little confused i bet we could have fit another chair james said well i dontwant you to have to go through my dad boring stories and stupid conversations lily said james laughed oh really yeah lily said and i sure he already put you through enough today what did he say to you anyway you know earlier today oh you know the usual take care of my daughter deal and

was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 3 forgiving lily went up to the head common room she sat on the silvery couch and started at the ceiling oh my she thought to herself i really cantbelieve that this is happening i am falling for james potter god did i just admit that but i am i really am how can this be happening she looked that the lily clutched in her hands he gave me made me a flower a lily none the less but how do i know he isntjust playing what if this really is just a game as much as i want to believe that so i can just forget about him i usually can tell when he is playing oh no some one is coming into the room and being as james is the only other person who knows the password chances are it him james came over to lily she looked confused lily what wrong james asked i i not in the best mood right now i guess lily said making something up for an excuse james looked at the flower he gave her clutched in her hands he took it from her hands she didntrefuse and he tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and placed the flower behind her ear as well there we go the two beauties are together now he said james why are you doing this lily asked what do you mean doing what this you are being all nice to me and it has only been 2 days how do i know that you arentplaying some sort of game something like you always used to do and then play a trick and laugh at it in my face you cantblame me for thinking that you know i mean you have been so nice to me it crazy but i just cantunderstand why what do you see in me or what did you see in me i just dontget it lily said lily dontever ever think that i know that i did stupid things really stupid things before but i swear to you that i not like that anymore and i would do anything to prove that to you and what i did see in you and what i still do is that you are the most beautiful person i have ever met inside and out tears started rolling down lily cheeks and the one thing james continued that i cantstand is to see you cry he said as he wiped a tear from her cheek she pushed his hand away and said then you obviously didntsee me after all of those time you did things to me or played tricks on me she paused and then said you would have been heart broken she then got up and headed towards her room please ask kendall to tell my teachers that i am not feeling well or tell them yourself see you later she closed her bedroom door james fell onto the couch why why does the girl mind have to work in such twisted ways it as if they are incapable of forgiving he thought to himself james walked down to the great hall for lunch and sat down next to sirius he put his elbows on the table and rested his chin in his hands what up prongs i completely baffled with the girl mind he replied uh okay sirius said oh and by the way kendall lily asked me to ask you something he said could you tell all of her teachers that she isntfeeling good so she wontbe there i ll tell her teachers in the classes she has with me james said sure but do you know what wrong with her kendall asked like i said i am completely baffled with the girl mind so no i dontknow james said ooooh is jamsie having a problem with our dear lillian not that you always haven t but more then usual maybe sirius asked shut it padfoot and yeah sort of james said what wrong this time kendall asked she just got all mad at me when i tried to apologize for all the things i ve done to her she didntreally blow up at me or anything she just did one of those making you feel really guilty things james said oh that she ll get over it soon kendall said are you sure james asked pretty sure and i mean you ve been really nice to her so far i dontthink she will stay mad at you for that long especially since you are both heads you practically have to live with each other she cantstay mad at you forever kendall said yeah i hope so james said we were actually getting along this year it was really nice james said and then went into a sort of dreamy stare bloke got it bad sirius said under his breath but james heard him and kicked him under the table later that day lily james yelled knocking on her door she didntanswer the first few times james please go away i dontwant to talk right now lily said lily please i dontknow how to make up for everything that i have done to you but i trying really hard and i really have changed this year pleaseeeeeee give me a second chance james said sounding desperate james i know you are acting like you have changed but i just cantbe sure i do want to forgive you but after thinking of all the stuff you have done to me it hard and i dontknow if i can james could tell she was up close to the inside of her door by the closeness of her voice james just leaned his head on her door she heard him he just whispered i sorry tears came to lily eyes she blocked out the little voice in her head telling her that it was really just stupid potter she didntcare she knew by his voice that he was really sorry she opened the door open a crack and james lifted his head i forgive you she whispered then she closed the door sorry it was so short but i had to end it there the next

abrupt of claps and cheering even from lily and james and vernon and petunia came into the reception room after they came in they shared their first dance together everyone crowded around and ooed and ahhed when they watched them dance lily wondered how petunia got so many people to come to her wedding she didntthink petunia had any friends or at least not that many after the first dance a fast song came on but james and lily went to sit down lily had her elbows on the bar counter looking down as she swung her feet around under the counter um lily james said in a really soft voice i taking it that they donthave firewhisky here either james said lily laughed no they don t dammit james said well do you know anything remotely similar um not really but uh why dontyou try something lily said

for lily which she took that is if you feet arenthurting you too much james said with a smile eh lily said my feet are numb by now anyway james then laughed and for you i d suffer lily said james laughed why thank you he said in a half mock way they headed over to the dance floor james slinked his arms around her waist and she put hers around his neck lily laid her head on his chest near his shoulder and the slowly danced once the song was over they went back to their seats and started talking the night passed quickly enough and it was soon time to head home mr and mrs evans decided not to wait for all of the bridesmaids and went home with james and lily after saying their good byes to their eldest daughter and wishing her the best of luck on her honeymoon mrs evans decided to drive because she was the only one out of the group who only had one glass of wine very early in the evening while as the others had all had more than that to drink james and lily sat in the back seat which was quite jammed and were playing footsie for almost the whole ride back lily then just leaned her head on james shoulder for the rest of the ride when they arrived back lily was going to set up a mattress in her room for james mum we have an extra mattress right lily asked if not i could just conjure one well why doesntjames say in petunia room i sure it will be more comfortable mrs evans said lily just looked at her mother no really i fine on a mattress james said nonsense mr evans said he then shot lily a death glare that clearly said there is no way in hell or on earth that this young man is sleeping in my youngest daughters room and so help me god for my wife even suggesting it in the first place uh okay then i ll go change the sheets lily said awkwardly james followed her upstairs with a look of disappointment on his face lily grabbed some fresh sheets from the linen closed in the hallway uh sorry bout that lily said you can get changed in my room i ll go put these on lily said referring to the sheets okay james said after lily changed the sheets and james changed into boxers and a t shirt lily came into her room okay it all set i just have to get you another pillow but let me get changed first aright lily said sure i ll go wait in the other room james said knowing to give lily her space lily changed into a pink nightgown that fell right above her knees and then went to give james an extra pillow here you go she said tossing james a pillow which he caught and placed on his bed goodnight dear mrs evans said coming up the stairs with her husband night mum lily said goodnight mr and mrs evans james said politely goodnight james mr evans said he then gave a look meaning no funny business james just smiled back politely assuring him that there would be none mr and mrs evans went into their room and shut the door goodnight lily said night love james said lily then leaned up and gave james a sweet goodnight kiss when she pulled away she just smiled as did he and then walked back to her room james stared at her has she walked back noting her nightgown lily then closed her door james closed the door to petunia room and had a look around he saw that petunia had a bulletin board too but it was covered with pictures of vernon great james thought how am i going to sleep with pictures of that fat whale surrounding me james sat down on the bed and started thinking he had a plan he waited 15 more minutes making sure that lily parents were asleep and then quietly opened his door he saw from underneath lily door that her light was still on which meant she was still up reading probably he went over to the door and knocked on it very lightly lily pulled away from her book when she heard a knock on her door she got up went over to her door and opened it slightly james what are you doing she said in a harsh whisper if my parents see you they will kill you then we wontlet them see me he said smiling lily sighed and let him in james closed the door behind him very softly lily turned back facing him to find her face only centimeters away from his did you want something she asked softly yes he said well what did you lily started to say but was cut off james leaned in and kissed her lily would have protested it being after midnight with a boy in her room with her parents only across the hall but she couldn t lily kissed back deepening the kiss and put her arms around his neck james toung begged entrance to which lily immediately complied james then started moving forward causing lily to back up soon the were right up against the side of her bed and then gracefully fell down upon it lily scooted herself back further on her bed james still kissing her at first james was putting his weight on his two hands on her bed but soon shifted it to one his other arm reaching down her arm lily ran her fingers up his neck and through his hair she then tilted her head back as he kissed down her neck onto her collarbone he then lifted up and kissed her again passionately on the lips she moaned a little bit but not to loudly as to disturb her parents james then went bold he reached his free hand down to lily thigh and started slowly bring his hand up higher and her nightgown with it although she knew that she wouldntlet james get that far she didntstop him james couldntbelieve his luck maybe he would get to but james had gone a little too far up for lily likings and realized how late it was so she pulled away leaning her head back down on her bed she smiled up at him come on it really late it past one how bout we pick up on this some other time when my parents arentacross the hall james smiled leaned down and gave her one last deep kiss alright love james said with a smile lily started to lift up and james got off from on top of her james stood up and then so did lily she pulled down her nightgown and flattened it out a bit james took her hand in his see you in the morning love he said it already is the morning lily said with a smile well then see you in the later morning james said smiling back he then gave lily a quick kiss let go of her hand and went opened her door before he left he turned and blew her a kiss she blew a kiss back and smiled james then smiled and shut her door disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always

at her clock it was 10am lily could have slept for another 5 hours but decided that it was time to get up she went straight downstairs not wanting to wake james if he was still sleeping when she reached the bottom of the stairs she went into the kitchen on the counter she found a note from her mother dear lily your father and i have gone out to say goodbye to petunia before she heads to

she then got some bread and put it in the toaster lily could have used her magic to make breakfast very quickly but things always tasted better the long way as her bread was toasting she put two eggs in a frying pan and started cooking them she got some cheese out and melted it on the top of her eggs as she cooked them just then she heard footsteps and she turned around from the stove morning love james said smiling coming into the kitchen morning lily said with a smile i was just making breakfast are you hungry actually i am james said lily laughed she then put her toast onto a plate and put the eggs onto the toast and made it into a sandwich here you go she said but this is your breakfast james said i ll make another lily said you want some orange juice sure james said lily got a glass

her eggs but why james asked because it tastes better that way lily said as you can see she turned to him smiling fure fing james said through another bite lily laughed james then stood up and went over to the stove where lily was cooking her eggs he ran a finger down the back of her hair what is this thing james asked lily giggled it a stove she said you cook things on it really james said

mmhmm james said kissing back down her neck not that that doesntfeel beyond words but my my breakfast is going to burn if if you dontstop lily said in a whisper as she shivered from his touch okay james whispered into her ear kissed her on her cheek and stepped back lily opened her eyes and inhaled big then letting out a small exhalation she put her eggs onto her toast do you wanna finish your breakfast lily asked in a quiet voice sure james said smiling loving the effect he had on her they both sat down at the kitchen table and ate their breakfast after they finished lily grabbed their dishes and put them in the sink uh do you want to get changed and go outside or something lily asked sounds great james said okey dokey lily said like a child james smiled they both headed upstairs lily went up first followed by james and he watched her as she went up the stairs he wanted her so bad right there he just wanted to have all of her at that very moment but he would wait until lily

jean capris and a white tank top she brushed her hair and put it into a ponytail she put on some white flip flops and checked her appearance in the mirror make up wasntreally lily thing she looked

the bathroom as he walked over to it lily stepped out and smiled james smiled back and said i ll be there in a minute okay lily said with a smile james walked into the bathroom how is it that she can

those are lily joked yes my dear i know what swings are james said lily laughed alright then she said the went out through the kitchen to the backyard lily sat down on one of the swings and expected james to sit down on the other swing he instead came behind her and started pushing her gently so that she started swinging lily smiled you donthave to push me she said i know but it makes it more fun doesntit james said lily laughed as he pushed her higher yes it does she said james continued to push lily on the swings and she enjoyed every moment of it it like flying lily said as james pushed her only not as good as the real thing james said as he pushed her well this way at least i can visibly see the ground lily said i taking it that you dontlike flying then james said as he started pushing lily slower so she came closer down ug ever since my first flying class it didntgo too well and i ve always had somewhat of a fear of heights no way james said as her swing was almost completely stopped yes way lily said with a laugh well i have to take you flying then it one of the best feelings in the world and you completely forget about your fears up there james said uh i dontknow lily said oh come on pleaseeeeee it will be so much fun james pleaded oh alright lily said she then leaned her head back so she could see him he smiled down at her and then bent down to give her a kiss once he broke away she beamed up at him come on lets have a contest james said excitedly what kind of contest lily asked laughing lets see who can jump farther james said come on they both started swinging and when they were both at the proper height james said okay on the count of three okay okay lily said one two three james said they both jumped and without question james won hey no fair lily said you are taller then me so that means you have an advantage cause you have longer legs oh come on now dontbe a sore looser james said emphasizing looser ah you little lily said be careful love dontsay something you would regret james joked oh i won t lily assured him they both laughed come on then show me some things in your yard james said he then pointed over close to the house what that lily looked over to where he was pointing and laughed that a hose she said what a hose james asked lily laughed again it has water in it and you can water plants and stuff with it lily said no way james said yes way lily said see look this is the nozzle where the water comes out from james picked it up and looked at it he then squeezed the handle no knowing what it would do and water shot out of it and hit lily right in the stomach lily just took a step back and looked down at her shirt in disbelief a look of excitement shock and sorry spread across his face but james couldnthelp but laugh his eyes widened at what the hose just did and burst out laughing lily just looked at him that was bloody brilliant james said lily just stared at him no apology or anything lily asked james just looked at the hose and sprayed her again cracking up even harder this time james potter lily yelled she grabbed the hose from his hand and sprayed him only more violently getting his hair soaked and everything but james just burst out laughing lily couldnthelp but smile at his immaturity so she laughed too he just grabbed the hose back and sprayed her again getting her almost all soaked she then lunged to get the hose from out of his hands but he wouldntlet it go so they both laughed fighting over the hose meanwhile the hose was on shooting straight up in the air drenching them both after a while surprisingly lily finally availed and got the hose out of james grip the then laughed with victory and sprayed james with the hose he tried running away from her but she chased after him after a while james finally surrendered they decided to lay out in the sun to dry off before trudging through the house all wet lily lay stomach down propped up on her elbows and james lay on his back with his head resting on his hands lets play the truths game lily said what that james asked its like truth or dare only all truth so we go back and forth telling each other something lily said alright the sky is blue james said lily let out a sigh not like that like i ll ask you a question and you ll answer it okay shoot james said umm lily thought tell what one of your most embarrassing moments seriously james asked yup lily said that time in 5th year after owls when you had that whole blow up at me and everyone was watching and you had the last word out james said coyly really lily said with a smile i always had the last word james said but not that time haha okay your turn lily said hmm why did you decided to finally give me the light of day james asked truly curious for the response well you actually had a civil conversation with me without asking me out and i saw that you werentthe arrogant bully that i thought you were lily said with a smile alright then james said smiling okay what are your best and worst memoires lily asked hey that two questions james said oh well lily said tell me james grinned oh alright he said my best memory was when you said that you loved me james said lily smiled which i do she said james smiled back and my worst memory was the look on your face when i pushed that leslie git off of me when she kissed me lily smile faded not quite to a frown but it faded so i in the worst memory too huh she said well only because of how hurt you were james said turning over on his side to get a better look at lily i know she said fiddling with the grass that just wasnta good day james wished he hadntchose that as his worst memory but it was true the look of hurt on lily face could almost make him die he never wanted to see her like that again i sorry lils i shouldnthave brought that up again james said no it fine i just wouldntimagine that that would be your worst memory she said looking over at him but the look on your face the look of hurt i could hardly stand to see you like that and knowing that it was because of me james said but it wasn t it was because of that bitch lily said james was surprised that lily evans has actually cursed irregardless james said it was still because you at least thought it was me well that in the past now it doesntmatter lily said wanting to brighten the subject right it is james said what about you your best and worst memory james asked i d have to say the same lily said really james asked yeah when you told me that you loved me and when i saw yeah lily said james nodded although it would be a close tie for my best memory between that and when you took me to the fairy world so conveniently located in your backyard lily said with a smile james smiled back okay what do you want to do right now lily asked still going along with the game james just looked at her her wet clothes clinging to her body drying in the sun something that you d slap me for saying james said with a half grin on oh lily said catching his meaning well i wouldntslap you for saying it but i just lily said no dontworry lils i a guy so that just spells it out right there but i love you with every

downstairs for breakfast morning mum lily said why good morning dear awfully chipper this morning mrs evans said i going over to james today remember lily said oh yes that right mrs evans said will

tomorrow mum lily said goodbye dear mrs evans said lily gave her mother a hug goodbye and aparated with a bag of overnight necessities just incase she really could stay over she ended up in the potter front yard and went up to the front door and rang the doorbell within moments james opened the door a huge grin immediately spread across james face and he scooped her up and planted a big kiss on her lips when he finally let her go he left her breathless good to see you too she said finally james smiled come on in lily entered the potter estate and although she had of course been there before she was still blown away mum and dad are out at a meeting with the minister of magic but mum says i quote tell lily we are so sorry that we missed her we really enjoyed her company last time and hope she

time and it was just as she left it it was like james had kept it that way to remember her she smiled and put her bag down she then headed out to the patio when she arrived james was waiting outside hey she said coming out which caused him to immediately turn to her and when he did he smiled hey he said um i set up for us to eat out here is that okay sure lily said with a smile james led her over to a white patio table and matching chairs it had a stargazer lily on it in a vase and two butterbeers oh i haventhad a butterbeer in ages lily said they both sat down they talked for a while and then a house elf came out it brought them napkins utensils and salads thank you lily said as the house elf brought them their salads the house elf bowed and left she ll be back with the meal in a couple minutes james said alright lily said they both ate their salads and then the house elf came out carrying two dishes as it came up james looked at what it was carrying what that james asked in a demanding voice well mr potter sir you see the house elf began to say i said chicken picatta not chicken parmesan james said but sir we didnthave the proper ingredients the house elf tried to say i dontbloody care go get what i asked for you git james said lily was appalled james lily said what this stupid elf never gets things right james said my deepest apologies mr potter but we don t well then get the right ingredients james said the house elf drooped its head and quickly hurried away you cantjust treat it like that it did its best lily said it always screws up their job is to get what you want james said lily couldntbelieve her ears you donteven pay it how would you feel if someone yelled at you like that lily said lily it just a bloody house elf it doesntmatter james said realizing that lily was getting upset maybe not to you but you cantjust treat them like that lily said very angry that is how they are treated though james said i dontbloody care lily said standing up throwing her napkin on the table i not really hungry anymore so you can tell your slave that it doesntneed to cook for me she said and stomped off inside james watched her stop off and go inside realizing that she wasntcoming back he then got up to run after her this was supposed to be a special day and it was going terribly wrong lily ran up the spiral staircase and headed for her room james came inside as lily was running up the stairs and then ran after her taking two steps at a time lily please he yelled catching up to her as she speedily walked down the hallway lily just kept on walking disgusted with the way james acted he ran up next to her and grabbed her arm forcing her to stop get away from me she said pulling her arm away james acted completely on instinct and grabbed her arm again pulling her closer to him and he leaned down and kissed her his toung begged for entry and surprisingly lily indulged james kissed her deeply hoping it would fix everything lily then realized her mistake and pushed him off of her with both hands and stormed down the hallway james was deeply confused he chased after her again and once again grabbed onto her arm to get her to stop get off of me she said as she slapped his hand away but lily you just i mean you what james said utterly confused dontdo that to me lily yelled do what james yelled back dontkiss me like that lily yelled what but you let me you kissed me back james said james when you kiss me i cantbe mad at you and i mad at you so dontkiss me lily said huh james said very confused i cantbe mad at you when you kiss me it just not possible so i mad at you so dontkiss me lily yelled and went into her room and slammed the door in james face james just stood there staring at lily door dumbstruck he just backed up to the wall and slid down sitting still looking at her door hoping it he stared at it long enough she would come out she didn t disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 33 the right feeling lily slammed the door in james face she couldntbelieve what just happened how had he been so cruel to that elf because it the only way he knows how to house elves a voice answered back in lily head but he shouldnthave been so cruel how would he know people learn from example that is how they treat house elves in the wizard world uh i dontcare lily argued with herself she flopped down on her bed and wished that the whole argument never happened james sat outside of her room staring at her door sirius bounced down the hallway coming up to james so what up chum heard a bit of yelling and i figured that you two probably werentshagging at this time of day so i came to see what the ruckus was sirius said james didnteven pound him for suggesting that but just stared at lily door sirius bent down and started waving his hand in front of james face prongs are you in there sirius asked yeah james responded very out of it what wrong mate sirius asked me and lily just had a fight james said about what sirius asked i was mean to the house elf james said oh alright then sirius said standing back up that it james asked yeah you two always forgive each other sirius said i going to alyssa for a bit gee thanks a bunch james said maybe i was a little too mean to the elf james thought well way to mean in front of lily i guess but that is how they are always treated right but lily doesntlive with house elves and she doesntknow that bloody hell i such a git james sighed and stood up i hope she forgives me james then went into his room right across the hall and just laid down on his bed soon sleep found them both lily wanted to aparate back home but she knew that her parents wouldntbe home until late and she didntwant to be alone in her house this was a very good thing for her to do because her dreams were far from pleasant that night while james was dreaming his little fantasies of him and lily lily was have a horrible nightmare lily was walking down what seemed a never ending hallway and it was all black considering the circumstances lily felt oddly happy she suddenly came to a room to which she found james in he smiled at her and she ran and gave him a big hug before anything happens i just want you to know that i love you more then anything in the world james said i love you too lily said but what would happen before lily knew it she suddenly saw a pair of red eyes and james dropped dead in front of her lily jolted up from bed she just had the worst dream no it was a nightmare a terribly nightmare voldemort had killed james she tried to close her eyes but just saw the pair of red eyes she immediately opened her eyes again lily breathed heavily and wiped the sweat from her forehead she checked her surroundings she was still in her room at the potter estate she had just seen james that day he was fine he had to be oh god lily thought i just fought with him today oh my god what if something happened to him lily bolted out of her room and ran across the hall to james room she knocked on his door hoping he was in there she heard a grunt and then footsteps coming to the door james opened the door his eyes squinting his glasses in his hands lily let out a huge sigh of relief and rested her head on his chest oh thank merlin you are okay lily said starting to cry james quickly put his glasses on lily what wrong he asked i just had the most horrible dream voldemort killed you right in front of me and i couldntdo anything about it an then i remembered that i was yelling at you yesterday and that if anything happened to you and then i came here and you re here you re okay oh thank god lily said rambling between sobs she gave james a huge hug i so sorry she said i dontknow what i would have done if something happened to you and i had just yelled at you james stroked her hair so glad that she was in his arms it okay lily i right here and i really sorry i was wrong to be that rude and mean and i sorry james said lily looked up into his eyes hers still tear filled i forgive you she said just try to be a bit nicer to your house elf okay james smiled i promise he said lily gave a half smile good she said lily took a little step back she turned and looked at the door to her room and then back at james james can i sleep with you tonight just sleep i mean i dontwant to be alone not after the dream i just had lily asked james was ecstatic of course he said with a huge grin he then held the door open when lily walked in and then closed the door once she was in james walked over to the right side of his bed and put his glasses down on the nightstand lily walked around to the right side and got in bed thanks i really didntwant to be alone lily said james scotched over towards lily and then pulled her closer to him you think i would pass this up james asked lily let out a small laugh james kissed her bare shoulder and softly caressed her arm i sorry i yelled at you lily whispered i sorry i acted like a git james said i still love you i really do lily said barely audible i love you too james said more then anything lily sniffled that what you said in my dream before lily i here with you right now and everything is alright james said okay lily said they just laid there for a while and then lily whispered i love you right before she drifted into a deep sleep having no trouble at all knowing with james there nothing could happen i will always love you lily always james whispered and then started drifting asleep and at that moment james knew that lily was the one for him he always somehow knew but at that moment with lily in his arms asleep it just felt right a n thanks for the awseome reviews guys it makes me fell sooo great that you guys like my fic thanks again disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has

the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 34 confusing ways james awoke fairly late and at the moment had forgotten of the previous nights events when he opened his eyes he was a bit shocked to see lily laying next to him but the evens from last night came flowing back into his mind and he couldnthelp but smile james reached for his glasses on his nightstand once he had his glasses on he turned back over facing lily who was now stirring lily eyes fluttered and she looked around forgetting where was when she turned to her right she saw james laying there smiling lily turned over on her side so she was facing him she smiled and then closed her eyes again morning lily said still smiling morning

where the bloody hell are you came sirius voice from down the hall they then heard stomping and then sirius swung open the door to james room sirius stopped short when he came into james room his mouth dropped open when he saw lily laying next to james but when he realized it he quickly closed it sorry he said and then quickly left there was soon a sound of stumbling down the stairs james and lily both looked at each other with wide eyes and quickly bolted up from bed and ran out of james room they reached the stairs and ran down them and when they reached the bottom they heard a loud thump coming from the closest living room and sirius cry of pain owwwwwww sirius yelped when james and lily reached the living room they saw sirius jumping up and down on one foot while clutching the

james asked in frustration my mum is going to kill you if you continue to destroy our house dontstart with me prongs sirius yelled as he stormed off into the kitchen james and lily looked at each other and then quickly followed after him i thought this was a woman thing but i need chocolate sirius yelled rummaging through the cabinets in the kitchen throwing food around everywhere padfoot

sirius because i bloody distraught and need chocolate sirius yelled back the two then started yelling back and forth at each other getting louder and louder that is until one voice towered over all both of you shut up or i ll go get my wand and make you shut up lily yelled making both james and sirius stop immediately just staring at lily in amazement now lily said her voice lowered sirius would you care to explain why you are going around trashing james house james was still staring at lily in amazement of how she could just suddenly take control what lily snapped at james staring at her

she tell you why she broke up with you lily asked sirius folded his arms yeah he said care to tell us the reason james asked she said that although she wants to be with me she cantsee it turning into something serious and that it wouldntbe fair to keep going out sirius said completely overwhelmed did you ever consider that maybe that that is a good reason lily asked how could it be sirius blurted out well mate you know your er reputation so to speak and do you really want to be in a fully committed relationship james asked i dontknow sirius admitted i thought i did well maybe you are not meant for a relationship with full commitment yet and still need to be the old sirius again for a while james said hopefully maybe your right sirius said james gave lily a look saying i gonna have some guy talk now lily nodded understanding james put his hand on sirius back and they started to head out of the kitchen lily started to clean up some of the food that sirius threw about well mate how about

they should head off to hogsmead then something dawned on him how could he have forgotten james immediately threw open his nightstand drawer and started fishing around in it james what are you doing lily asked sitting on the edge of his bed where is it james said mostly to himself as he rummaged through his nightstand drawer aha little bugger james exclaimed what were you looking for lily asked james handed her a box wrapped in silver paper this is for you he said i was going to give it to you yesterday but um little disputes shall we say got in the way lily just glared at him which i totally take all responsibility for james replied as if reading her mind just open it james said softer it a thank you for the most wonderful six months of my life he said smiling lily smiled sweetly back at him and then opened the box what she found was a silver heart imbedded with what looked like and probably were diamonds dangling from a silver chain lily held up the necklace and looked at it in awe oh my god it beautiful she said thank you so much she said wrapping her arms around james neck giving him a huge hug i glad you like it james said grinning i love it lily said can you put it on me sure james said lily turned to the side still sitting on the bed and pulled her hair up so james could put the necklace on her james reached around lily neck and then fastened the clasp on her necklace okay james said thanks lily said and let go of her hair lily hair brushed past james hands as she let it go he then brushed her hair to one side and started kissing down her neck damn lily thought weak spot score james thought weak spot lily didnteven try to pretend anymore she had fallen for the potter charm heck she had practically surrendered to it i dontknow how the hell i resisted this last time oh right my food was burning lily thought james lily whispered shhh james whispered back lily felt herself turn to jello inside she leaned back to him giving him full advantage james maneuvered himself so that lily was now facing him and he was leaning over her lily then leaned back and james leaned forward to the point in which they were both laying down james just stared deep into her eyes and she stared back into his they hadnteven kissed yet but lily was already breathless james leaned down and kissed lily with everything that he had if possible he poured all of his love for her into that one kiss lily slowly lifted herself up and put her arms around his neck after a while james decided to go for it he started to reach up and unbutton her blouse she didntstop him okay potter you can do this james thought she didntstop you yet just go for it it now or never right oh shut the bloody hell up lily broke away and just stared deeply into his eyes she didnttell him to stop but breaking away probably didntlook like an encouraging sign but she knew exactly what he was doing you donthave to do this you know james said i know lily said i said i would wait as long as you wanted and i meant it james said sincerely i know lily repeated i want to but we are supposed to go to three broomsticks with sirius really soon she said yeah james said realizing she was right and you cantlet sirius down after alyssa just broke up with him lily said james smiled that my girl always putting others first james started to get up off of lily but she grabbed his arm but that was no signal to stop kissing me she said james laughed and lily smiled so they snogged for a bit longer until it was finally time to force sirius off to three broomsticks for some down to earth drunken times after long enough lily finally broke away again come on let not leave him hanging lily said alright james said reluctantly and got up lily got up quickly buttoned the few buttons that james managed to undo and started to head out of his room i gonna go get my bag you should go get sirius lily said she then paused in his doorway and if you want to continue this later on donteven think about getting drunk she said pointing his finger at him sure thing my dear james said saluting but lily kept a stern face i mean it she said and then went across the hall to her room james then took a look in the mirror his hair was messy but that was nothing new otherwise he just brushed off his shirt and headed to sirius room padfoot ol buddy ol pal time to go james said pounding on his door jesus prongs i never protested dontgo knocking the bloody door down sirius said opening the door what the bloody hell happened to you james said i found some chocolate under my bed after all sirius said looking overly stuffed james let out a half sigh half laugh let clean you up then after a couple minutes sirius was looking quite smashing and lily came to his door and knocked just a second came james voice then james came out dragging sirius along with him padfoot here found some chocolate after all so i had to clean him up a bit james said lily laughed alright then she said we should probably get going are you alright to aparate james asked sirius yeah he said okay then let be off james said the three aparated to three broomsticks and went inside they got seats at the bar all of the tables were taken and they ordered drinks firewhisky sirius said butterbeer please lily said james who was sitting between lily and sirius looked from sirius and then back to lily butterbeer he said what up with that sirius asked what about getting rip roaring drunk james then whispered something in his ear and sirius started laughing hahaha alright then go sober on me by all means sirius said laughing lily glared at james well at least it cheered him up james said lily let out a small smile and laugh their drinks soon came and they all sipped away whoo sirius said i needed that after drinking a large amount of his firewhisky after a while sirius was indulged in his drink and james was explaining some quidditch tactics to lily someone then came and sat down in the empty seat next to sirius firewhisky please she asked sirius looked over and saw a very pretty girl with dark brown hair chestnut eyes and she looked about his age funny how that is hey she said smiling hey sirius said returning the smile i scarlet she said rather giddy sirius sirius said oh is it sirius black the infamous marauder scarlet asked in curiosity sirius turned a bit towards her that right he said

dontremember seeing you well you would have but you were going out with that alyssa girl for a while scarlet said yeah well that ship has sailed sirius said taking another sip of firewhiskey really she asked guess commitment isntquite my thing sirius said with a dry laugh yeah i can relate to that scarlet said james and lily were absorbed in conversation when sirius tapped james on the shoulder prongs me and uh sirius said forgetting her name uh scarlet sirius said that right he said under his breath yeah me and scarlet here are gonna take a bit of a walk james eyed him alright you want us to wait james asked no that okay i ll meet you back there sirius said you too drunk to aparate back there james asked nah i fine sirius said and then dropped his voice but i have my two way mirror incase you have yours yeah it in my room james said right then sirius said in normal volume be seeing you later then donthave too much fun without me sirius said with a wink james took the hint sirius and scarlet then walked out of three broomsticks well i d say that was successful lily said sure was james said we wanted to cheer him up and we got him to go off with another girl excellent lily laughed you two are hopeless she said oh really james asked well i as a matter a fact didnthave any firewhisky i noticed lily said almost proudly james grabbed lily hand ready to go back lily smiled yup she said they then went outside and aparated back to the potter estate they arrived back in the potter front yard james knew that his parents were and an auror meeting so he had nothing to worry about james looked over to lily who was grinning she then gave him a quick kiss on the lips and then started running to the house yelling over her shoulder catch me if you can a grin spread over james face and he immediately started running after her even though james legs were much longer then lily s she gave him a bit of a run for his money he chased her up the stairs and when he reached the top he lunged out for her hand which he caught and pulled her back causing her to spin inward towards him their lips immediately met but then lily pushed james off playfully and started running again james chased her all the way down the hallway to his room when they got there james once again seized lily hand and pulled her towards him causing them again to kiss james put his hand up to lily cheek and deepened the kiss after a while she broke away again and ran over to his bed bouncing down on it and kicked her shoes off james came right after her kicking his shoes off as he came over to her leaning over her at that moment he just bathed in her beauty he had always know how lucky he was to be with lily but he then realized that he was the luckiest guy in the world to be with lily he then leaned down and kissed her with more passion then he even knew was possible he could have stayed there kissing her forever but realized what he was getting to was even better he finally broke away and gazed into her eyes realizing all over again how lucky he was he then started to pull her shirt off over her head and then continued kissing her until she helped him off with his shirt too james half expected sirius to come bursting into his room for some unknown reason but luckily there was no disturbance james reached down to help lily off with her skirt as did lily with his pants after they skimmied out of the rest of their clothes it was nothing but them and that was just fine little did they know that not too far away sirius his old self again too was having a hell of a time a n thanks for all of the awseome reviews and just thought i d let you know i was listening to this one song and it fits so perfectly with the whole lily james thing in case anyone wants to listen to it it called in this life by chantal kreviazuk enjoy lol disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 37 the morning after it was around 12 30 pm and everyone was still sleeping james parents had gotten back around 3 am so they were obviously sleeping and sirius had gotten back shortly after that james awoke grinning it took him only a second to remember why he turned to his left and saw lily sleeping soundly james scooted over to her and put his arm around her she slightly stirred and then turned her head to look at him she smiled and then turned back what time is it she asked sleepily uh james said he then turned over and looked at the clock on his nightstand 12 35 he said lily jolted are you serious she asked james resisted from saying no i james yeah why lily immediately jumped up and started gathering her clothes i have to get back home or else my mom will start going crazy lily said putting her clothes on aw lils please dontgo james said sitting up i have to she said i ll come back later for the rest of my stuff she then kneeled one knee on the bed leaned over and gave james a quick kiss and then stood back up bye she said with a smile i ll be back later and with that she aparated off james ad a look of disappointment on his face he wish that she could have stayed longer at least she coming back later he thought and with that and thinking about the previous night he quickly put some boxers on and headed downstairs for some breakfast well lunch really james went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich soon after james went down sirius came down and he too wandered into the kitchen hey prongs sirius said as he came into the kitchen ello padfoot james said still wearing a huge grin you want a sandwich you slept with lily sirius exclaimed james grin faded a bit and he gave sirius a fake puzzled look but he knew he couldntdeny it to his friend i thought you were joking when you told me why you werentgoing to have firewhisky sirius said well now you know that i wasntjoking lily made me promise that i wouldntget drunk james said sirius laughed well good for you mate good for you sirius said patting him on the back james continued to grin and then took a bite of his sandwich so is that some kind of early birthday present or something sirius said joking blimey i almost forgot lily birthday is next week james said how is it that even i know that lily birthday is next week and you her boyfriend and new shag partner have almost forgotten sirius asked james hit sirius upside the head i guess i ve just been a bit preoccupied with other things james said ah of course sirius said james just glared at him a habit he picked up from lily what should i do for her birthday james asked dontask me loverboy she is your girlfriend sirius said alright and how was your evening i didnthear you come in last night james said that is because i didntcome in last night sirius said i came in this morning james let out a small laugh right well did you have a er nice time james said with much hinting as a matter a fact i did sirius said she may have just been a one nighter but she was a good one nighter sirius said raising his eyebrows too much information mate james said glad to see your back to your old self feels good you know without this commitment rubbish sirius said well even though i think that you are off your bloody rocker at least you arentsulking james said too true sirius said now what was it you were saying about a sandwich lily arrived in her driveway and quickly let herself inside hey mum i back lily said oh hello dear mrs evans said i was beginning to

said serving lily her lunch you can stay the rest of the day but please dontbe back too late okay thanks mum lily said around 2 pm lily headed back to the potter estate she aparated into the front lawn and then went up to the door and knocked she heard a crash from inside the house and then james appeared at the door still in his boxers why hello love james said and he leaned down to kiss lily when he finally broke away lily asked what was that crash oh that was just sirius in the kitchen he said something er rude and i punched him in the shoulder and he dropped his plate james said scratching the back of his head lily let out a half sigh half laugh alright then well i came to get the rest of my things she said okay james said rather glumly as lily stepped the rest of the way inside and he closed the door behind her she then turned to him and if it okay i allowed to stay a bit longer she said james immediately brightened okay he said lily laughed at his excitement i ll go get dressed then he said they both headed for the stairs sirius then came out of the kitchen heading for the front door why hello lilykins have a good time last night he asked lily didntrespond where are you off to james asked off to play a bit of quidditch in the yard sirius said with that he went outside leaving lily and james inside lily slapped james arm you told him she hissed he my best mate he just knew james said defending himself lily just glared at him oh alright she finally said they both headed upstairs james went into his room to get changed and lily went into the room she was staying in to get her things once she packed them she went back over to james room and knocked on his door come in james said lily walked in and saw that james was sitting on his bed getting his shoes on lily sat down next to him so what do you want to do he asked her oh i dunno lily said anything really after she said that they heard a knock on james window hello in there sirius said from outside the window on his broom dontdo anything rash i shall know he said and then flew off laughing why dontwe go flying you said that you ve never been before well besides that one flying lesson james said uh i dontknow if i could stomach being on a broom let alone in the air on a broom lily said oh come on it will be fun i promise james said lily still looked hesitant you know i wontlet anything happen to you he said matter o factly oh i suppose lily said still hesitant brilliant james said accio broom james said and his broom came flying out of his closet and into his hand he then grabbed lily hand with his other hand and then started off come on then he said they then headed outside once they were outside lily still seemed afraid dontworry you will be fine james said he then got lily to mount it and he sat on the broom behind her he put his arms around her so he could hold onto the broom in front of her he then kicked off and they started going up lily had her eyes closed the whole time still very afraid come on lils you have to open you eyes james said lily shook her head no i don t she said come on it not that bad i wontanything happen to you you cantfully experience flying if you dont open you eyes james said oh alright lily said and with that she let out a deep breath and opened her eyes she didntthink that they were that high up but she sure was wrong lily widened her eyes and then leaned back a little into james it not so bad right he asked her completely puzzled how anyone could not like flying uh lily said she gulped we are uh definitely high up james laughed that we are he said suddenly sirius zoomed past them and lily let out a little scream padfoot what the bloody hell was that for james yelled over to sirius thought i d keep you on the alert sirius yelled back you are impossible james yelled back well maybe so but i also faster then you sirius yelled back and soared off come on lets go after him james said to lily um lily said but before she could say anything else they had zoomed off chasing sirius lily closed her eyes again but then finally worked up the courage to open them when she did they were flying full speed catching up to sirius we ve almost got em james said they then picked up speed and zoomed past sirius james then slowly came to a halt and turned the broom around facing sirius got you mate james yelled to sirius sirius just mumbled under his breath and flew in the other direction james can we go down now lily asked sure james said and he lowered the broom down when james feet were back on the ground lily quickly got off of the broom and then collapsed to the ground her legs feeling a bit shaky that was definitely a different feeling then one would usually have lily said quite exasperated james sat down next to her yeah it great isntit james said um from a certain point of view lily said james laughed well did you at least have a tiny bit of fun he asked lily smiled and turned towards him yes i did she said james couldntdo anything but smile and lean over and kiss her sirius then landed near them oh get a bloody room will you two he asked they completely ignored him or better yet james room second floor fifth door on the right i sure you re familiar of its whereabouts sirius said realizing that he was getting no response he walked back into the house leaving james and lily alone in the backyard a n

knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 38 lacking in common sense about a week later lily and alyssa were over at kendall house to celebrate lily birthday peter was at remus house and james and sirius were at the potter estate planning for lily birthday james and sirius were in james room planning for lily birthday james was sprawled across his bed thinking unsuccessfully and sirius was sitting in james desk chair leaning on the back two legs with his feet on the desk james let out a long uh in frustration why do i need to be here again sirius asked rather bored you are here to help me think of what to do for lily birthday james said yeah i know that sirius said but why because i am bloody clueless and it is the first time that i am actually going to get to be with lily on her birthday james replied sitting up why dontyou just have lunch with her or something like that you know with all the romance and snogging and lovey dovey time sirius said blowing the hair out of his eyes padfoot please try to be helpful james said well why dontyou as i said set up lunch for her or something sirius said i guess james said but where up my bloody arse sirius half yelled i dontknow he yelled again ooh ooh i know james said with a grin what sirius asked blandly i ll take her to fairy world james exclaimed what the bloody hell is a fairy world sirius asked well let put one and one together mate james said it a world with fairies thanks for clarifying that for me sirius said sarcastically care to explain well you see i couldntreally tell you because uh fear of destruction but there is as lily said a fairy world conveniently located in my back yard and you thought that you would just casually slip that into the conversation sirius said not quite believing him well like i said mate i was afraid that you would destroy the place james said well i suppose i cantblame you for that sirius said but are you serious of course you aren t i am but really sirius asked james just disregarded his comment well yeah there is should i have lunch for her there james asked so i assume miss lillian knows about this place eh sirius asked yeah james said i took her there when she was over at the very beginning of the summer sirius brought his hand to his heart and said prongsie i am very hurt how could you trust evans more than you trust me james threw a pillow at sirius will you come with me and help me set some stuff up james asked well i dontknow prongsie i dontknow if i can be trusted that is if this fairy world does exist sirius said james just gave him a look please mate i really want everything to look good james said oh alright sirius said with defeat evans sure has taken over your mind lily her name is lily james said mmhmm sirius said standing up yes i know james laid back down on his bed so where is lilykins anyway sirius asked well she at kendall right now with alys she at kendall for a little birthday bash and she coming tonight james said so we need to set things up today and you thought that planning this the day she is coming was a smart idea sirius asked well excuse me mr procrastinator james said eh well i suppose i can see where you are coming from sirius said so you ll help then james asked oh i suppose sirius said just dontsnog in my presence if it can be helped will do mate james said james and sirius headed for the woods and james showed sirius the fairy world they conjured up a bistro table and chairs arranged with the fairies to bring food in and surprisingly left with minimal destruction meanwhile at kendall house lily alyssa and kendall were sitting on kendall bed and alyssa and kendall were giving lily her birthday presents ooh open mine first kendall said alright lily said excited lily unwrapped kendall gift it a diary kendall explained that only you can open i thought that might come in handy brilliant thank you lily said now mine alyssa said lily unwrapped alyssa gift alyssa had gotten her a beautiful new bag it a purse that will never get filled up alyssa said no matter how much stuff you put in it can fit it all thanks lily said that sure will come in handy alyssa then grabbed one more gift what that lily asked this is one gift from the both of us kendall said aw guys you didnthave to lily said honestly although she was excited go on open it kendall said lily opened the gift and it was a large scrapbook we thought that you would like a scrapbook of all of your memories from hogwarts kendall said there are a lot of funny ones in there alyssa said thank you guys this is bloody brilliant lily said flipping through the pages she came across many that jogged almost forgotten memories for instance she had almost forgotten or rather blocked out of her mind how much she hated james there were pictures from 1st year until 7th year and all three girls flipped through the pages looking at the pictures oh look kendall said this one is from 3rd year after james turned your hair green and you gave him a pig tail that he didntnotice for almost the whole day kendall said laughing lily laughed hah i almost forgot about that she said i didn t alyssa said he was in my transfiguration class that year and you should have seen the look on mcgonagall face she was the one who told him about it lily laughed again they flipped through the pages some more and they had eventually reached 7th year they saw pictures from the ball s and the quidditch games and on the last day a whole swarm of memories came rushing back to them and they immediately started sharing stories i think it so cute how you and james were at each others throats constantly and now you are together it so sweet kendall said lily smiled yeah it is she said they came across a picture of them at the farewell ball lily with james kendall with remus and alyssa with sirius alyssa quickly turned the page but kendall and lily still hadntheard about the whole break up whatever happened between you to anyway kendall asked i just could tell that he was holding a part of him back you know just staying with one girl and i didntwant to be the one girl that was holding him back alyssa said and i know that he feared commitment so that wasntworking and i guess i guess i dontreally want commitment right now either oh kendall said how did he take it alyssa asked lily knowing that lily was over at james house when she broke up with sirius he uh he went around and destroyed half of the house but once he had some chocolate he was a lot better lily said alyssa let out a forced laugh ah she said yeah and then him and james were bickering and i had to shut them up lily said kendall laughed but is he okay now alyssa asked yeah lily said she didntthink that she should mention the fact that the day after alyssa dumped him he hooked up with another girl alyssa nodded so when are you going to james house kendall asked changing the subject seven lily said back at the potter estate james and sirius came out of the woods where james had just set everything up for lily birthday with the help of sirius of course they headed inside through the back doors and were about to head upstairs but james stopped short and pulled sirius back when he heard his parents voices coming from the study the door ajar they peered through the crack in the door and listened to james parents talking at twelve o clock that way we will have enough time mrs potter said so how exactly will we be doing that mr potter asked well they think that i going there but you have all of the information so we will be switching bodies for how bloody awesome would that be sirius whispered to james bloody awesome we have to find out how james said so the book with the spell in it is on the top shelf in the library i ll go get the ingredients for it mrs potter said alright how long should we sirius and james ran up the stairs excitedly once they leave we can go back and get the book james said this will be bloody brilliant sirius said well james said if we ve never heard about it it might be illegal it probably only for aurors and it probably pretty difficult prongs we are two of the best and most handsome marauders so donteven talk to me about difficult sirius said james laughed alright they heard james parents doing some sort of spell in the library and then exit and head for the front door alright boys we are going out to a meeting we ll be back later mr potter said alright mum james said coming to the stairs to see his parents off is lily still coming over later mrs potter asked yeah james said okay be careful and tell her that we said hello mrs potter said we will probably be back really late but that doesntmean you can have a party here mr potter said directing it mostly to sirius dontworry mr potter sirius yelled from his room see you boys later mrs potter said they both left leaving james and sirius alone james ran back to sirius room come on let go find that book james said they went to the library and climbed up the ladders to the top shelf they looked around and searched for something that could have to do with switching spells the auror files sirius read aloud holding up a book james looked over at him and sirius turned to james that was easy james said they both climbed down and sat on the couch in the library they flipped open the book and found a page marked alas sirius said body switching james took the book from sirius here it is the incantation james said what do we have to do sirius asked it says here james said and pointed to a part on the page after they read over it they started to grab the materials they needed alright well we still have a couple hours before lily comes so we should be able to do this and then switch back sirius said you sure james asked yeah yeah it will be fine sirius said they then did the spell and awaited for something to happen i dontfeel any different james said do you nope sirius said examining his hand maybe we did it wrong oh well maybe we can try it later or after lily leaves alright loverboy sirius said james and sirius got up and went for a swim before lily came back at kendall s alright i have to go to james now lily said okay kendall said have fun alyssa said thank you guys so much for the gifts lily said no problem have a great birthday tomorrow kendall said thanks lily said she then said goodbye grabbed her things and apparated to james house lily arrived at james front yard and walked up to the door and knocked she heard a door open and two people running and what sounded like someone slipping and falling then the door finally opened and james stood there dripping wet still in his bathing suit behind him sirius was sprawled across the floor clearly because he slipped when he came running in james grinned and gave her a big hug dripping water all over her when he finally pulled away he realized that he had dripped all over her oh i sorry james said lily laughed it alright she then took out her wand and she was dry again in an instant happy early birthday lils sirius said attempting to stand up but slipping again in the puddle that he made lily laughed as sirius struggled to get to his feet so what have you two been up to today lily asked nothing james and sirius replied okay then should i be worried lily said no really we were uh just in the pool james said yep just in the pool sirius added alright then lily said still a bit unsure come on lets go put your stuff upstairs and i ll go get changed james said okay lily said as they headed up the stairs i coming too sirius added finally getting up to his feet the three of them went upstairs and sirius went ahead of them to his room so where should i put my stuff lily asked well you can have the same room as last time if you want or you could stay with me james said hopefully lily smiled lightly noticing the eagerness in his voice alright but only because it my birthday she said james gave a big grin and they headed to james room james opened the door and then stepped to the side so lily could go in first she smiled in thanks and walked in where should i put my stuff lily asked uh anywhere really james said still taking in the fact that lily agreed to stay in his room lily put her things in a nice neat pile in the corner of the room so what do you wanna do james asked oh i dunno whatever really lily said well you re the birthday girl james said not yet lily said smiling well in less than 5 hours so it up to you james said are you hungry i sure we could whip up an early birthday cake alright lily said grinning james grabbed lily hand and they headed for the kitchen i know there is some sort of spell book in here for making a cake james said searching through some cabinets we could always bake one the muggle way lily said what that could take hours james said lily laughed alright alright i ll help you look for a spell lily said aha james said pulling out a book from one of the cabinets here it is come on and choose which one you want lily came over next to him and flipped through the book he examined her as she flipped through the book and twirling a piece of hair around her finger with her free hand he ran his hand nervously through his hair thinking about lily birthday and hoping that she would like what he planned for her ooh how about this one lily said pointing at a picture of a white confetti cake as you wish james said looked up the incantation and conjured up a cake lily smiled oh it looks yummy lily said enthusiastically james got out two plates two forks and cut him and lily a piece of cake happy birthday love james said handing her a plate with a piece of cake on it lily took the plate and smiled thanks they both sat next to each other on the counter in the kitchen eating cake and dangling their legs down lily leaned her head on james shoulder you know if a year ago someone told me that i would be spending my 18th birthday here i probably would have hexed them lily said with a laugh well what would you do now james asked i dunno lily said with a mischievous grin james jumped off the counter and held his hand out to help lily down let go upstairs james said lily grabbed his hand and jumped down alright she said still grinning james and lily headed out of the kitchen and then sirius came in ello prongs lillian sirius said sirius looked like he wanted to tell james something so he said go on up lils i ll be there in a minute alright lily said and she headed upstairs listen mate i went over the spell and i couldntfind out what we did wrong sirius said james sighed a little perturbed that sirius interrupted him for this dontworry we can figure it out later he said yeah sirius said but how bloody brilliant would that be if we could get it to work we could change bodies with anyone and we wouldnthave to take a slow arse time to make a pollyjuice potion it will be bloody brilliant yeah mate it will be james said i just wish it would have worked we have to figure out what we did wrong sirius said okay we will can i go now james asked impatiently sirius laughed alright then go have some fun with lilykins but if you are going to do anything use a silencing charm i need my beauty sleep sirius said james whacked sirius in the back of the head as he headed out of the kitchen as we all know james and sirius are a bit lacking in common sense meaning that they didntturn the page

should she wait for damn oh right sirius thought um how about on the patio sirius said alright lily said she then smiled and walked out of the door does sirius have no taste at all james said to himself as he searched through sirius drawers for some clothes he then heard a knock on sirius door and quickly grabbed jeans and a shirt just a minute james said and then quickly put on the clothes he then opened the door and saw lily standing at the door oh damn james thought she looks so beautiful why canti just be me right now uh hi james said hey uh i was wondering if something was wrong

different and you saw him he even forgot to tell me happy birthday and he like ran out of his room this morning lily said and then clasped her hand over her mouth not meaning to say that last part what would sirius say what would sirius say james thought oh so you slept with jamsie eh james said i didntsay that lily said right then well i think that loverboy is fine and why dontyou er wait downstairs for him james said trying his best to impersonate sirius alright thanks lily said and then turned to leave once she left james closed the door and let out a huge breath that he wasntaware he was holding in i a bloody idiot james said how could i have been so stupid to do a spell like this obviously there was some twist to it james kicked sirius bed with his foot and then sat down this was going to be a long day sirius walked downstairs and met lily on the patio okay put on a good act just act like prongs and noting can go wrong just dontkiss her or prongs will kill you and or lily will murder you that makes me feel so much better shut up okay now focus just pretend to be prongs it will all be okay sirius thought hi lily said as sirius came outside hello love sirius said okay that was good very james of me sirius thought sirius then held out his arm which lily linked her arm through so where are we going lily asked excitedly to the fairy world for a bit of lunch sirius said aw that so sweet of you lily said clinging onto his arm what does james always say he thought anything for you love sirius said they walked into the woods and headed to the bridge oh blimey i dontremember where the bloody bridge was sirius thought it was somewhere through here i think do you know where you are going lily asked uh i um when i hit my head temporary brain laps sirius said are you okay lily asked really concerned yeah i fine sirius said wow i really can see why prongs loves her so much well i think it was somewhere this way but it was really dark last time so i dontreally remember lily said oh i remember sirius thought oh i remember he said sirius had an instant spark in his head and remember where james had taken him yesterday they started walking towards the bridge and they were in an uncomfortable silence are you okay is anything wrong lily asked damn why is she so smart she must really know james i fine sirius said you asked me that before no i mean you just seem to be acting different lily said damn damn damn what should i do he thought no really i fine i just felt a little sick when i woke up this morning that all sirius said lily stopped although they were almost at the bridge do you want to go back an lay down or something lily asked yes that would be splendid but prongs wants your birthday to be super special so no he thought no really lils i fine sirius said we are almost there anyway well if you re sure lily said they reached the bridge and sirius tried to remember what james had said the day before uh yeah um fairies it me james potter and i here with lily evans can we er come in sirius struggled to say lily looked at him peculiarly but didntsay anything a fairy came out of the water just as it should and said just what it said before and granted them entry oh thank merlin sirius thought they soon entered and sirius brought lily to where they set up lunch for her they sat down and the fairies soon brought them some food this was so sweet of you lily said thank you so much no problem sirius said and put on a smile they ate lunch mostly in silence and then lily tried to start up a conversation because it seemed clear that james wasntsaying anything how do you think you did on your newts lily asked the results should be coming in next week thank merlin this is a question i can actually answer sirius thought well i think i did bloody brilliant in transfiguration definitely an o in that and pretty good in everything else he said what about you i think i did okay in charms but i not sure about everything else lily said oh come on you probably got straight o s sirius said i dontknow lily said i bet you did great sirius said lily smiled after they finished sirius stood up ready to go he asked i suppose lily said good enough for me sirius thought right now how do i leave again oh i ask one of these mosquito things fairies right i ask but his thoughts were interrupted lily had grabbed his hand and then leaned up and kissed him okay here is the spell james thought bloody idiot didntturn the page alright here is how long it will take affect 12 hours that makes sense we probably changed when we were sleeping now how to reverse it james then read aloud the quote from the book to reverse this complex spell one out of the two who did the spell must be kissed passionately by their true love do not attempt this spell if the true love is unknown or else the switch could become permanent once one is kissed by their true love the switch will not occur as the way it did in the transformation when the kiss takes place instead of the minds switching the bodies will switch james slammed the book and ran out to the backyard lily pulled away looked up and saw not james but sirius lily screamed and then yelled what the bloody hell sirius realized that they and somehow switched back and then held his two hands up and started backing away from lily who looked like she was going to explode lily please dontkill me sirius said and why shouldnti lily yelled advancing on him lily please listen james and i did an switching spell and we didntthink that it worked but it ended up taking a few hours or so and he is back at his house as me finding out how to fix it and we are really sorry but james didntwant to ruin your birthday so he made me pretend to be him so you could still have a good birthday and i guess he figured out how to switch us back and please please dontkill me sirius pleaded lily let out a huge scream in frustration get me out of here get me out of here now lily yelled sirius quickly got one of fairies and they soon were back at the bridge as soon as they were out lily immediately apparated to james back lawn not wanting to be in sirius presence any longer sirius quickly apparated after she did james ran out to the back yard and saw lily suddenly pop into his yard right after she did he saw sirius appear behind her and it was the real sirius james looked down at his hands and saw that they were his hands not sirius he then realized that he had glasses on again he was back in his own body that meant that sirius and lily must have james saw lily storming off towards him and sirius chasing after her lily stormed over to james you bastard lily yelled when she had almost reached james lily please james said but never got to finish when lily reached him she slapped him across the face when james looked back up at her holding his tears in he saw lily face already dripping with tears before he could say anything she apparated back to her house and she was gone a n ah thanks for all of the reviews well i hope you liked the chapter the next one will be up soon disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 4 winter note it winter now i didntfeel like writing all the stuff in between but lily and james are friends again and they are now planning the winter ball i really dontcare about the junk that happens in the middle like during classes and stuff so yeah i skipping ahead i thinking muggle formal wear

it will be fun lily said gotcha so that that should we make up posters james said sure i can ask kendall to do that she good at art stuff lily said great so is that it james asked i think so lily said listen i gonna go take a walk outside in the snow wanna come lily asked really sure james said they walked outside it was snowing it looked like a fairy tale winter wonderland james and lily walked side by side talking about random topics enjoying the snow i always used to just take walks in the snow when i was little i guess i felt i could just get away from everything all you see is white and you kind of just feel alone and away from everything lily said yeah i know what you mean james said they walked silently for a while then lily noticed that james wasntnext to her anymore she looked around and called his name james and then suddenly she was hit with a snowball hahahahah you should have seen your face james called from behind a tree you re going down potter lily yelled hoisting a snowball at him it hit him straight on in the face glasses soaked and all ooooooh look who talking now lily said but then she was hit again with a snowball oy i ll get you for that lily yelled throwing a snowball at james they laughed throwing snowballs at each other ducking behind trees lily looked around and didntspot james anywhere then suddenly from behind her james throws a snowball at her and it gets all over her hair she screamed playfully and ran away james throwing snowballs behind her alright alright you win i give up lily said then james stopped lily turned around and found james face only inches away from hers she got pulled into his hazel eyes and said slightly out of it and dreamy i give up james started to lean in towards her he was just about to bam sirius had come outside and had just thrust a snowball at james head not knowing what he just interrupted sorry james muttered and then cursed at sirius to himself i gonna get you padfoot james yelled hoisting snowballs at him sirius and james threw snowballs at each other for a bit and then lily thrust one at james joining in on the snowball fight oy now both of you are against me james yelled and threw a snowball at her james lily and sirius threw snowballs at each other for a while and then called a truce guys i frozen i gonna go take a shower and change see ya later lily said and started to head up towards the heads common room once lily was completely out of site james hit sirius upside the head ow sirius said what d you do that for he asked you idiot do you know what i was about to do right as you threw that first snowball at my head and do you know who wasntrefusing james asked half yelling oy prongs i so sorry mate i didntknow sirius said no no you didn t perfect timing mate perfect timing james said walking up to the heads room james decided as he was walking up to the heads room that he was going to ask lily to the ball he couldntwait any longer truffles james said and walked into the common room he slumped into one of the big chairs by the fireplace and waited for lily to finish showering lily eventually came out of the bathroom dressed in a white robe and a towel on her head she smiled at james and then walked towards her room hey lily could i ask you something james said uh sure just lemme go change first she said james waited patiently for her to come back out and when she finally did she was dressed in a white shirt and green plaid pajama bottoms nothing too risky well of course james thought she looked beautiful in anything so what up lily asked sitting in the chair across from james uh i was wondering about the ball james said oh i know lily said we have to go with each other i just got the owl from dumbledore what james asked the winter ball head boy and girl have to go with each other some tradition or whatever lily said oh right right that yeah james said even though he had heard nothing of this well uh james said making some excuse i was wondering what you are wearing cause um i have to kind of match i guess james said i not sure yet but the trip to hogsmead is this weekend so when i pick something out i ll let you know okay lily said yeah sure james said well i gonna go to bed now night lily said night james said lily smiled and left although she tried not to show it she knew that james was going to ask her to the dance thank god she had gotten that owl with dumbledore letter or else she would have had no excuse she also knew what james almost did when they were outside in the snow she just couldntregister everything right now and had to play dumb meanwhile in james room uh why does nothing go right for me i actually worked up the guts to try to kiss her and try to ask her to the ball but no both times something goes wrong james said aloud in his room even know the sirius is the reason i didntget to kiss lily he bound to know what to do where my cloak with that james found his invisibility cloak and started to head out to the gryffindor common room but before he left he realized something hey i a head i dontneed permission to be out late at night i dontneed this he said looking at his invisibility cloak but as soon as he said that he immediately did need it he saw lily door opening and he quickly covered himself under his cloak lily looked around making sure no one was there and of course someone was but lily couldntsee him then she went to the doors in the common room that opened to a balcony and then led down stairs and outside lily opened the doors quietly and headed down the stairs out to the snow filled hogwarts grounds james was too curious he had to follow her sirius could wait till another time he grabbed a blanket off of the couch and headed outside following lily lily walked for a while and then found a tree the tree right near where her james and sirius had a snowball fight earlier that day and just stood in front of it staring at the frozen over lake james waited a bit and then came over next to her and put the blanket he brought on her shoulders she was a bit surprised that he had followed her but she really didntcare at the moment she was just staring out at the lake i used to ice skate you know she said james looked at her as she said this i haventbeen in a couple years but i still remember how to why not james asked dunno i just kind of stopped one year i still

what she asked well you know before about the ball well i never actually got dumbledore letter i was going to ask you to the ball but then you said the thing about how the heads have to go together so i just went along with it james said oh lily said now looking at her feet as james looked over at her well it looks like we have to go together anyway so it doesntmatter lily said but it does matter james said lily then looked up at him if i had asked you would you have said yes james asked b but i would have know that we were supposed to go together lily said searching for excuses but what if you didn t what if we didnthave to go together would you have said yes james asked damn lily thought why does he have to do this to me uh i dontknow lily said looking away never mind james said and then started walking away lily just watched him walk away dontdo this to him or yourself lily said to herself you may not want to admit it but you want to go with him you really do and you are already so why not tell him i would say yes lily screamed running towards him james stopped dead in his tracks and turned around facing her you would james asked if you asked me lily said hinting james james sighed with relief would you go to the ball with me lily james asked yes i would lily said james grinned lily quickly kissed him on the cheek and ran away up to her room how did you like it let me

house and she was gone soon after she left the tears in james eyes turned to rage and he stared at sirius who looked like he was about to run for his life now prongs just listen for a second sirius said but was cut off james came up to sirius and punched him the face knocking him down james kneeled down and attempted to thrust more punches at him but sirius held up his arms and tried to hold him off prongs prongs now can you just listen to me sirius said between dodging punches prongs will you just bloody listen to me for one minute james stopped why should i listen to you you didntlisten to me you kissed her you bloody kissed her that was the only way to reverse the spell for one of us to kiss our true love james yelled lily is my true love sirius asked james kicked him in the leg no you

leaving sirius in the yard he then went back to the patio and then apparated sirius sulked inside and up to his room and flopped down on his bed this was not good james apparated to remus house in desperate need of advice he knocked on the door and remus came to the door hey prongs remus said he then saw the look on james face and said what wrong i need your help mooney james said come on in remus said james walked in and they went into the living room what wrong remus asked again james told remus everything about the spell and how they thought it didntwork and then how lily kissed who she thought was james but it was really sirius and then she slapped him and left crying all on her birthday well that not good remus said no kidding james said with his head in his hands what should i do i came here right after she left well right after she left and i punched sirius she is probably at her house crying and i cantbear to think of her like that he said go after her james remus said james looked up at remus it was only when things were really serious when they would use their real names not their nicknames go after her remus repeated james quickly got up and ran outside remus followed after him maybe you should bring sirius with you so you can explain the whole thing he said good idea james said thanks mooney no problem remus said good luck james then apparated back to his house and ran upstairs to sirius room he knocked on the door and then let himself in come on we have to go to lily s james said so you forgive me then sirius said dontgo that far james said but i need you to help me so i forgiving you for the time being i can deal with that sirius said what do we do we go to lily and explain everything to her james said sirius and james then apparated to lily house and ended up in her driveway okay good james said her parents car isnthere so hopefully they arenthome right then should we knock sirius asked better not just incase james said let go to her window james and sirius went to the back yard and james picked up a few rocks and started throwing them up at lily window wonder who that is lily said sarcastically to herself lily then walked over to her window and looked outside and as she thought there was james and sirius was with him lily can we please talk to you james yelled up to lily lily opened her window go away she yelled back down lily please let me just explain to you james said go away lily yelled again she then shut her window and walked away what do we do now mate sirius asked james looked up climb the tree right sirius said they started climbing the tree and james climbed to the closest limb to lily window sat on it and reached over and tapped on her window what lily yelled coming to the window lily i just james started to say but he then saw her face and saw that he she had tear stains down her face you ve been crying he said way to go mr observatory lily said you came here to tell me that well then you did goodbye she said and then walked away from the window james looked back at sirius for support lily we want to tell you what happened so you can know the truth and say how sorry we are sirius yelled lily stormed over to her window and opened it i not an idiot i can put two and two together you did a stupid spell probably an illegal one you then didntrealized that it would take a few hours to kick in but then this idiot here she said pointing at james didntthink that i could handle the truth so he made you she said pointing at sirius pretend to be him lily said james didntsay anything well yeah sirius said james turned around and gave him a look that said not helping he then turned back to lily you she said to james are an idiot and you canteven tell me the truth and you she said to sirius i i just disgusted with you lily then shut her window and walked away lily please james yelled lily stormed back over to her window and pulled the string on her blinds letting them fall down james let his head down come on mate let go sirius said i cantgo james said i have to actually talk to her i dontthink she in the mood to listen sirius said james looked at the window and then looked at the ground he let out a long sigh i guess you are right he said let climb down then sirius said no it alright i ll just jump down you climb down james said sirius nodded and started to climb back down james then turned back to lily window lily i know you can hear me he said and i just want to tell you that i am so sorry he then paused and i love you james then looked at her window nothing he then swung his leg over the branch let himself down so he was just hanging with his hands and then let go and landed on his feet on the ground he then steadied himself and prepared to apparate lily then after she heard james jump peered through the blinds she saw james hand come down from his face which looked like it just wiped away tears she then saw sirius pat james on the back in a reassuring way and then james turned back to look up at lily window she continued to look down at them as james looked up their eyes met and their eyes never left the others and then james and sirius apparated back to the potter estate lily let go of the blinds turned away from the window and wiped a tear from her eye a n thanks for all of the reviews keep em coming lol well dontworry lily wontstay mad at james for too long and everything always works out doesntit thanks again more soon disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 41 second thoughts lily stared out the window for what seemed like forever until she finally walked away and collapsed down on her bed thinking and crying james and sirius apparated back to the potter estate james just stood there not saying anything sirius decided to talk first listen mate why dontyou just go walk around a bit it looks like it going to rain soon but you should just go think i going inside unless you want me to stay he said no james said with a sigh you can go in you re right i should just take a walk sirius nodded and headed for the door i ll be by the lake if you need me james said and walked away sirius walked glumly inside and up to his room james walked over by the lake and just stared out at it he picked up a few rocks skipped a few then plunged the last one forcefully into the water and hung his head down lily was awoken from her thoughts when she heard a huge boom of thunder she bolted up from her bed and knew what she had to do sirius was laying on his bed thinking of ways to possibly cheer up james or ways to possibly avoid being killed by him if something even worse happened between him and lily he then heard a loud boom of thunder which jostled him a bit and then soon after he heard a knock on the door he got up and walked downstairs seeing sheets of rain through the windows now pouring down he reached the door and saw lily standing there wet from the rain is james here she asked not making eye contact because of the awkwardness of earlier that day yeah sirius said he too not making eye contact he out by the lake lily nodded walked back out into the rain and walked to the side of the house by the lake lily walked towards the lake completely soaked from the pouring rain and saw james standing soaked and staring out at the lake she walked up fairly close behind him but didntsay anything james knew that someone was there he could sense them he then inhaled and could tell by the sweet smell in the air that it was lily he turned around and looked at her for a brief moment and then looked down and turned back to the lake they stood there for a very long time in an uncomfortable silence until james finally spoke did you want something or did you just come here to stare at the back of my head he said dryly still facing the lake lily walked over to him and slapped him on the shoulder i came to say i sorry but now i rethinking it lily yelled oh crap james thought how could you do something like that to me lily said how could you do a spell and illegal one and then not bother to tell me that sirius is in your bloody body lily i didn t james started to say you know what you canttrust me you cantbloody trust me you are my boyfriend and you canttrust me lily yelled that not true james said then why couldntyou tell me that you did that spell that way i wouldnthave gone off kissing sirius thinking it was you lily yelled because i knew you would get mad at me james yelled back well obviously lily yelled but i wouldnthave been as bloody pissed and hurt if you had just told me about the spell but instead you just tried to pretend to be each other on my birthday my bloody birthday james james searched for words but none came out you say you love me but you keep doing these things and all you do is keep hurting me lily yelled i do love you james said in a small voice well nice way of showing it lily yelled i cantbe with someone who doesnttrust me and right now it clear that you don t james just stood their dumbstruck soaking in lily words i not seeing this working lily yelled almost not believing what she was saying james eyes widened no lily please no james said shaking his head i cantbe with you if you canttrust me lily said i can deal with you being immature doing stupid things that you know you shouldn t but when you do something like that and not tell me i cantdeal with that james couldntbelieve what he was hearing he knew that he did those sorts of things but he never realized how much it affected lily he grabbed lily by the shoulders lily i cantlive without you he said releasing a few tears that he had been holding in his eyes lily pulled away james slowly let his hands down back to his sides feeling like lily just ripped out his heart and stepped on it lily looked back over at james and into his eyes his look of pure hurt made her want to die she couldntstand to see him like that even though she was angry as hell with him she watched him rain falling all around him looking like he was just about to curl up and die you need to be able to trust me lily said softly james looked like he had some life back in him when he heard her talk again i cantbe with you if you don t if you don t lily stuttered letting a few tears fall i ll do whatever you want james said in a pleading way i ll change i ll do anything i cantloose you you need to trust me you need to tell me when you screw up so something like this doesnthappen again you just need to tell me the truth lily said i promise james said nodding his head lily nodded turned and started walking away james couldntwatch her walk away he knew that it would jeopardize things even more they already were but he had to he ran up behind her grabbed onto her arm and pulled on it spinning lily towards him their lips immediately met and james pulled lily in close lily knew that she had just fought with james but she would do anything to be in his arms kissing him again and here she was lily clung onto james shirt and deepened the kiss james put his arms around her waist and pulled her even closer lily reached her arms up so they were around his neck and she pulled herself up lily ran her fingers through his hair and he reached further down her back james then lifted lily up a bit and then started to lean towards her until they gracefully and slowly fell to the ground a little after they fell james pulled away and looked down at lily they both breathed heavily slightly breathless and stared into each other eyes lily i love you so much and i am so sorry james said lily looked up at james who was leaning over her and said i love you too james leaned back down and kissed her and they both laid there feeling the rain pouring down on them disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage

pulled away lily opened her eyes staring straight into his and said nothing she looked up at james who was still leaning over her sort of on top of her and they just stared into each other eyes they both breathed heavily and could feel the worm breath of the other on their faces we should go inside lily said in a whisper as she exhaled alright james said he too whispering james got up and then held his hand out to help lily up let go get dried off james said as they started walking towards the house lily nodded the rain had completely stopped now good thing it clearing up james said why lily asked you ll see james said lily grabbed james arm stopping him james you cantjust kiss me every time we fight and expect things to be alright again she said that wasntwhat james had expected hearing i i know he said just because i love you doesntmean that i cantbe pissed as hell with you sometimes lily said james internally smiled he loved hearing lily say that she loved him how even in dark times hearing that from her made him realize how good life really could be james nodded in response to lily he then added i know and i understand he then paused i never really realized how much everything i did affected you and i glad about how the good things affect you but i cantstress how sorry i am for everything bad i ve done and how much that affected you good lily said they started walking again and they had almost reached the front door sirius peered out of his window and saw james and lily walking to the house he let out a huge sigh of relief that lily didntkill james he also was relieved that it didntseem that lily broke up with james because if she did james probably would have broken down crying he then thought of what james had hoped to do today and felt really guilty that he would most definitely have to postpone it lily and james were at the front door lily as you know even though it is getting late it is still your birthday james said lily let out a little laugh yes i have realized that she said well i know that recent events have how shall i say disturbed your birthday so far james said pausing with the look on lily face and they both stepped inside but i would still like to give you your birthday present they both took their wands out and dried themselves off alright she said okay wait right here james said excitedly and then ran up the stairs taking two steps at a time lily sat down on a chair in the foyer and waited for james james hurried down the hallway to his room as he past sirius room he heard him saying something how d it go prongs sirius asked as james past by well i wontbe murdering you tonight james said as he past by his room glad to hear it sirius said james then entered his room and immediately went to his nightstand drawer he rummaged through the drawer and found a small box not today he said to himself and pushed it aside i ve gotta gain her trust again first after a bit more rummaging he found what he was looking for a box with one of the marauders most ingenious inventions in it james hurried out of his room and when he came to the stairs he looked over the banister and saw lily sitting on a chair in the foyer found it he said which caused lily to look up he then hopped onto the banister slid down the railing and jumped off when he reached the bottom lily stifled her laugh to a suppressed giggle and then james walked over to her alrighty then let go have a seat outside and show you your birthday present james said lily grabbed the hand that james had offered her and stood up um james it just stopped raining everything will be soaked she said well we will just have to dry some chairs off then shall we james said and they proceeded to walk out to the back patio they went outside and walked over to two chairs james took his wand out and dried them off the air was heavy from the previous rain but fortunately the sky was clear james gestured for lily to take a seat and she did okay wait right here i ll be right back james said where are you going lily asked relax love james said it is a birthday surprise and it wouldntbe a surprise if i told you now would it lily smiled and nodded good then well like i said wait here i ll be right back james said james ran off with his box and opened it far out in his yard lumos he said and then searched through his box until he found what he was looking for aha james then set it down in the grass and ran back over to where lily was waiting he sat down next to her and smiled ready he asked lily eyed him suspiciously and then nodded right then james said he then sent out three bursts of light which looked like fire into his backyard look up lily looked up and then saw three huge bursts in the air which caused her eyes to widen james had set up fireworks to shoot in the air and then after they exploded they would spell out words the first three words spelled happy birthday lily lily looked at james awestruck he just grinned back there was something ingenious about these fireworks though the marauders wouldnthave it any other way when they exploded and spelled out words they would not fade away like fireworks usually would these fireworks would instead transform to look like the stars consequently making it look like these messages were written in the stars james then set out three more sparks from his want lily looked eagerly at the sky and waited to see what these explosions would spell out i love you lily turned to james and smiled james again grinned back lily leaned her head on james shoulder and looked up into the sky watching the words transform into stars james put his arm around her and kissed the top of her head now just one more thing to finish it off james said he then sent two more sparks out to the yard and then the sky lit up once more it read love james lily smiled up at the sky happy birthday lils james said thanks lily said james smiled how long will it stay like that lily asked oh just for tonight it will be gone when the sun comes up james said lily nodded when we first made these we were testing them and well they did go away when the sun came up but they came back the next night they stayed for a few nights actually james said lily laughed oh really she said and what might they have said lily asked james paused for a moment and then chose his words carefully well it was in 5th year after owls and well they said something on the lines of sniv snape and his scrawnies james said lily let out a little chuckle so after the lake incident in 5th year she said yes james said in a small voice i dontrecall seeing it lily said ever wonder why sirius and remus tried to keep you inside the last few nights of 5th year james asked yes actually lily said with a smile well i didntwant you to get even madder at me so they helped out when i took full blame and went to detention james said always doing the noble thing lily joked what can i say james said lily laughed at his self assurance i telling you me and mcgonagall had a bit of a row in detention james said she definitely wasnttoo pleased oh i thought she would have thought it was funny lily said sarcasticly james chuckled oh yeah hysterical he said well then again all of the marauders plans seem to always have a flaw lily said sitting up straight james was about to argue but he realized what she meant and he certainly didntargue when he noticed that she had pulled away so he couldntreach his arm around her anymore she turned so she wasntfacing him oh damn james thought i really hoped that she would quickly forgive me for it well why would she i was an idiot and didnttell her i should have told her well it too late for that now why am i so stupid like that she kissed sirius oh dear god she kissed sirius i mean i knew but it just hit me now what if she decides not to forgive me after all oh shut up brain shut up james reached over and grabbed lily hand and clenched it tightly in his she turned back facing him lily you know that i didntmean to hurt you right james said i know lily said james almost wanted jumped for joy right there but lily continued but the point is you did hurt me weather you meant to or not i know i did lily and i cantstress enough how sorry i am james said clinging onto her hand praying that she wouldntpull away james thanked the lord that she didn t lily sighed and turned to him she wanted to pull her hand away from his grasp but couldntbring herself to it believe me i would love to just kiss and make up she said but i can t i know that you didntmean to hurt me but i still got hurt and now i dontknow how i ever going to look at sirius again and i just really wish that it never happened because i cantstand being mad at you how about this you give me another chance james said lily opened her mouth to say something but james continued before she could i know you have given me way too many he said to which lily closed her mouth as if that was exactly what she was going to say and i will give you my word that i wontever do something stupid like that again and if i end up slipping i will be sure to tell you so that something like this doesnthappen again deal james said hopefully lily nodded deal james stood up grabbed both of lily hands pulled her up and brought her into a tight embrace thank you so much lils for everything james said and then took a small step back i really dontdeserve you no james don t lily started to say no really lily james said he put his hands on the sides of her face and brought it up so that their eyes locked i meant what i said earlier i cantlive without you all of those times i asked you out and you said no my heart would shatter and off i would go putting it back together only for it to be shattered again and i kept doing that until i finally got you and now that i have you i will never let go i ll never loose you i can t lily eyes started to fill with tears that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me lily thought i i lily said searching for words but she could find none luckily she didnthave to james leaned down and kissed her it was such a simple sweet kiss but it meant a lot more once james pulled away he gazed deeply into her emerald eyes she stared right back into his hazel eyes and finally breathed out i ve gotta go it real late dontyour parents expect you staying over here james asked lily paused for a moment it was still her birthday god this has got to be the longest day of my life it felt like at least a week right lily said you can go home if you want james said i was just saying he said realizing that she might need her space no it fine you re right and they are probably asleep anyway wouldntwant to wake them up lily said with a smile james smiled back come on lets go inside he said they both walked inside and up the stairs as they were walking down the hall sirius was coming out of his room and coming towards the stairs no doubt on his way to the kitchen oh bloody great like this isntawkward or anything sirius thought he was going to walk by not saying anything but lily spoke up sirius lily said sirius turned back around yeah he asked if i can forgive james then i can forgive you i think it was bloody stupid what you did but that nothing new you didntbetray james trust and kiss me i kissed you so lets just put it behind us and not make it anymore awkward then it already is okay she said sirius was a bit shocked at her little speech but agreed with it he brought his hand up and saluted yes ma am he said lily and james laughed they all smiled and continued on their way once lily and james were in james room lily breathed a sigh of relief well at least that is over with she said james nodded well i gonna get changed lily said walking over to her bags and grabbing her nightgown i ll be back in a minute she said and walked into the bathroom connected to james room james just quickly stripped down to his boxers and grabbed a t shirt to put on he then sat down on his bed and waited for lily to come out when she did he looked over at her so what do you wanna do he asked go to sleep lily said yawning long day she said smiling longest day of my bloody life she added james laughed yeah lily walked over and laid down night she said and then fell almost instantly asleep night love james said and with a wave of his wand the lights were out in the middle of the night lily abruptly awoke from a very startling dream very similar to one that she had before she quickly turned over to see james sleeping soundly which brought her immediate comfort she then quietly got up and walked over to james window seat she sat down put her legs up and stared out the window she looked up into the sky to see her message from james still written in the stars she smiled and then slowly drifted off to sleep a n sorry this chapter took longer then usual for me to post oh and ks the reason why i posted three chapters in two days before was not

was in a beautiful dress and walked swiftly to the end of the corridor which seemed like it would never come somehow she knew that it would end though so she kept walking surprisingly enough she reached once again a room at the end of the hallway with james in it he was wearing a tuxedo and grinned as she walked into the room hello love he said lily smiled hello he then placed his hands around her waist and they started dancing they danced for a while and then suddenly a flash of green light came shooting right towards james and he fell lifeless to the ground lily screamed and covered her mouth with her hands she knelt down next to james when she suddenly saw a hooded figure with red eyes approaching her she immediately stood up he came right beside her and sent a spell at her knocking her down how does that feel mudblood he asked lily didntanswer i said how does that feel mudblood he yelled and sent another spell shooting at lily she crumpled up and he walked over to her she got a good look at his eyes and yes it was voldemort eyes he walked over to her and instead of sending another spell at her he poked her in the arm with his wand lily was immediately puzzled how does that feel lily he asked and poked her arm again lily was so confused voldemort calling her lily and he was poking her he then started shaking her arm lily everything then went black and voldemort and james vanished lily then suddenly heard someone calling her name again only it wasntvoldemort voice lily james asked shaking her arm lily lily eyes bolted open and she took in a deep breath she looked around and saw that she was still on the window seat she had fallen asleep there then she turned to her left and saw a very worried looking james kneeling right next to her are you okay james asked i woke up and saw you sleeping over here and then i was going to put you back in bed but you started screaming and you looked like you were having a fit is everything okay lily wiped her forehead and noticed that she had been sweating she also noticed that she was shaking lily nodded swung her feet off the seat and attempted to get up james immediately stood up lily stood up and steadied herself nightmare lily said plainly she then tried to walk over to her clothes but she was still shaking her knees gave in and she started to fall over james quickly grabbed her before she fell and helped her up come on lily you need to lie down james said no really i fine lily said her hand on his shoulder steadying herself no you really are not james said he then picked her up so she was resting in his arms and then brought her over to his bed and laid her down lily started to protest and tried to get back up it okay i fine she said lily james said holding her shoulders to prevent her from getting up you need to lie down you would have collapsed if i didntcatch you and plus sleeping on the window seat must have been pretty uncomfortable just lie down for a minute and then get up when you can actually walk lily sighed and nodded i didntrealize that i fell asleep there i just woke up in the middle of the night and went to sit over there i guess i fell asleep she said what was your nightmare about you gave a pretty good scream james said lily thought for a moment and then realized what happened it was just like my other one lily said only we were dancing and then um he came and uh yeah and then he hit me with a spell and knocked me down and then after another spell he started poking and shaking me which was i guess just because that what you were doing to get me to wake up oh james said well it wasntreal and i right here dontworry but it felt so real lily said but it wasn t james said and dontworry i wouldntlet anything happen to you lily nodded i know she said and smiled james smiled back and gave her hand a quick squeeze you hungry i ll go get us breakfast james said i can come down lily started to stay you stay here he said and walked over to the door but really be right back james said and walked out of the room he is impossible lily said to herself with a laugh lily realized that she had stopped shaking and took a deep breath like james said it was only a dream it wasntreal just like before last time it wasntreal and nothing happened why should this time be any different but i had two of them two in one night i barely recall the first one but the second one it just felt so real dontbe silly everything will be fine lily was staring at the ceiling and was awoken from her thoughts when james came in levitating a tray of delicious looking food pancakes love james asked with a smile lily sat up and grinned back you didnthave to bring it up i fine now we can go downstairs ah but the food is already up here james said with a grin so why waist time going downstairs when our stomachs are asking for food now lily smiled as james came and sat down aw this is so sweet of you lily said and leaned over giving james a kiss on the cheek anything for you love james said smiling you feeling alright then yup lily said pouring syrup on her pancakes i just kept telling myself that it was only a dream which it was only a dream james smiled and nodded taking a bite of his breakfast after they finished eating lily got up without falling and went to get her clothes is it alright if i use your shower lily asked sure james said alright i ll just be a bit lily said which in girl language means several hours james joked lily gave him an annoyed smile and walked into the bathroom james put on jeans and a black t shirt and attempted to tame his unruly hair but failed miserably and just ruffled it even messier when lily got out of the shower she changed into jeans sandals and a dark green tank top she reached into her bag and found the emerald earrings that james had bought her for the winter ball she put them on and then with a flick of her wand dried her hair and put it into a ponytail she then exited the bathroom and saw james laying on his bed flipping through a quidditch magazine lily came out and smiled she walked over to her bag and started packing up her things leaving already love james asked putting down his magazine packing already lily responded as she packed not leaving yet well good james said and smiled he then noticed the earrings lily was wearing nice earrings james said with a sly smile lily grinned back thanks she said this really amazing guy gave them to me but you probably wouldntknow him she joked oh really james asked playing along yeah lily sighed he gave them to me the night that i agreed to go out with him the night that you finally agreed to go out with him james added why yes of course lily said and what a great night that was james said not playing along anymore lily grinned yes it was she said james came over by her and kissed her when she finally broke away she said i really should go do you have to he asked i should i dontwant to overstay my welcome lily said and my parents would worry well love you could never overstay your welcome james said but i understand lily smiled well then i should go but i want to thank your parents for having me again are they here she asked james scratched the back of his head nervously uh no he said auror meeting oh lily said alright then well can you tell them that i said thanks will do james said well i should go lily said i ll walk you downstairs james said lily nodded and grabbed her bags as she did so james grabbed them from her allow me he said with a smile lily smiled why thank you kind sir but of course fair lady they both laughed and headed down the hall as they passed sirius room he came out to say goodbye heard you leaving he said have a safe pop back lily laughed i will oh right sirius said here you are miss lillian your birthday present lily took the box of candies that he gave her thanks lily said both thankful and confused quite handy things i came across they are candies that will turn whatever flavor you are in the mood for thought you would enjoy that certainly is interesting lily said with a laugh thanks my pleasure sirius said but just a word of advice think real hard of the flavor you want i was in the mood for a nice plain chocolate piece once but then i thought of those lovely bacon snacks that i came across at the food store trust me not a good combo sirius said lily and james laughed alright thanks for the warning lily said james just laughed git he said what can i say sirius said and then said goodbye and went back to his room lily and james walked outside to the front lawn well my love this is where i leave you james said alright lily said i ll see you soon absolutely james said smiling she gave him a quick kiss and then apparated to her house james sighed and walked back inside he headed up to his room to get his broom so he could have a bit of a fly outside once he grabbed his broom he was just heading out of his room when he heard two pop and the voice of his mother hello boys we re back mrs potter yelled from downstairs james came over to the stairs and starting going down hello mum james said smiling mrs potter gave her son a big hug hello dear how are you she asked fine he said is lily still here his dad asked no she just left she told me to tell you thanks for having her over again james said oh well you tell her that she is welcome any time mrs potter said james nodded by the looks of things we shouldntbe celebrating yet mr potter asked james shook his head no not yet he said what happened mr potter asked as mrs potter headed for the kitchen uh james said searching for an excuse chickened out i guess he said not wanting to tell his father that the reason that things had gotten a bit shaky between him and lily was because he used an illegal spell him not being an auror yet from his parents spell book dontworry son mr potter said patting james shoulder when the time is right you will know i dontthink i ready yet james said lily just turned 18 and i dontthink that she would be ready either mr potter nodded well i think i will go join your mother in the kitchen i a bit hungry myself james nodded and was about to head outside oh by the way his father said james turned to look at him the invitations for the annual ball finally came in you can start sending them off to your guests if you like james smiled great he said i ll get on that ask your mother for them when you decided to send them out mr potter said i think i ll do that now james said leaning his broomstick on the stairs and going with his dad to join his mom in the kitchen after james got the invitations from his mom he went upstairs to his desk to write them out i cantbelieve that i forgot to tell lily about the ball eh well i guess everyone is forgetful sometimes james then sent three invitations one to lily one to remus and one to kendall after he sent them he realized that his parents were very good friends with they reynolds meaning alyssa would probably come maybe i just wonttell sirius james thought it would get him in too much of a frenzy lily put down her book when she heard an owl tapping on her window she opened it and took the letter from it leg and gave it some owl treats the owl then flew away and lily opened the rather fancy looking envelope lily evans you are cordially invited to attend the potter annual mid summer night ball this

help zipper her dress i dunno lily said to alyssa sirius has been kind of down lately i bet he still misses you alyssa put her dress on and then pondered for a moment you really think that he has thought about me she asked duh kendall said you are the one who broke up with him who knows if he doesntstill wish you two were together lily definitely decided not to tell alyssa about the several girls that she heard sirius had hooked up with after she broke up with him eh well i guess i just had to dump him first before he dumped me i could tell that he was going to alyssa said really because from what i heard and saw sirius was really upset when you dumped him lily said really alyssa asked yes lily said she then paused for a moment and examined the situation you still like him dontyou alyssa eyes widened w what of course not she said in a most unconvincing way uh huh sure kendall said oh just drop it alyssa said she then looked in lily mirror so how do i look amazing lily said sirius will be drooling kendall said alyssa glared at her not as much as remus will when he sees you in that she replied nah the one who is sure to drool is james when he sees lily in that kendall said lily blushed yeah right she said in a shy voice okay how about we all face it all of our boyfriends or former boyfriend are going to drool when they see us we look smashing kendall said i second that lily said alyssa crossed her arms i guess come on where is that bold personality that i know is in there kendall asked alyssa studied herself in the mirror he gonna drop dead alyssa said very firmly atta girl kendall said kendall was wearing a tight fitting gold halter dress that fell past her feet with a ruffle going down the front alyssa wore a pink dress that was fitted at the top and puffed out at the bottom with ruffles swirling around it lily wore a light blue gown that was wrapped in at the waist and fell past her feet kendall had her hair in an up do with pieces falling down around her face alyssa had her hair down in curls with a pink headband on that matched her dress lily had her hair put up halfway with a clip that matched her dress and had her hair worn straight all three girls looked amazing and started with their makeup when they were all finished lily looked at the clock five till 8 right on time she said let go all three girls apparated to the potter estate and lily took a deep breath and then knocked on the door earlier at the potter estate prongs you are going to injure me with that thing sirius said as james attempted to help him with his bow tie you asked me to help you and i helping you james said finally getting sirius bow tie on so is pete coming the ball is going to start in 10 minutes remus said nah pete still in germany with his parents

and you couldntbother to tell me that she was coming sirius bellowed he then started chasing james around the room remus laughed at the two as they ran around luckily for james someone knocked on the door i ll get it he yelled and ran right out of his room sirius was about to chase after him but remus caught his arm padfoot take a deep breath and calm down deal with the fact that alyssa is coming if you dontcalm down when she gets here she is going to see a very red faced sirius and that wouldntbe good remus said right sirius said it not like i care or anything remus laughed sure mate whatever you say whatever you say james ran downstairs and opened the door he lost his breath when he opened it to see kendall alyssa and lily james just stood there with his mouth open staring at lily who was blushing you going to let us in or is the party outside alyssa asked james blinked and came back to his senses uh yeah right come in he said and stepped out of the way for them to come in he then closed the door and turned back facing the three girls james then ruffled his hair still an old nervous habit and found his voice again he turned to kendall and said uh remus should be down in a minute and uh sir he then paused to turn to alyssa and then stopped and turned back to kendall remus will be down in a minute okay thanks kendall said and uh there is food in the ballroom he said pointing to the ballroom and that where everyone is kendall and alyssa nodded and headed to the ballroom lily then turned to james and smiled wow you look wow james said searching for words lily smiled thanks she said and who knew that you could look so great in a tux lily added james gave a half smile and continued to stare at lily thanks but really you look amazing and i he said searching for words again lily then looked up at him waiting for him to finish his sentence he couldnthowever and instead leaned down and kissed her lily was a bit shocked at his but quickly recovered herself and kissed him back when james finally broke away they both smiled james potter at a loss of words never a good thing lily said still smiling believe me this time it good he said lily beamed up at him and then james held out his arm to which lily linked hers through and they started heading for the ballroom as they headed there remus and sirius came downstairs lily smiled hey guys she said hey lily

but james laughed and they headed for the ballroom when kendall saw them come in she ran well shuffled due to her heels over to them and then threw her arms around remus neck and gave him a kiss remus stepped back a bit because of the force kendall used when she threw herself at him but then steadied himself put his arm around her waist and kissed her back easy on him now it almost that time of them month sirius said and then realized that what he just said came out sounding different then his usual purpose and then burst out laughing kendall immediately broke away oh my god are you okay she

twirled her back in close and put his hand on her waist lily smiled do you think that they will get back together she asked dunno james said i hope so though he was so much happier when he was with her and he wasntaround as much lily laughed you re terrible she said half heartedly well he my best mate it my job to come down on him james replied lily just laughed and they continued dancing sirius walked back into the ballroom and decided to have a bite to eat he went over to the buffet table and started to fill his plate when he turned around to go find a seat he spotted alyssa and went into a complete stare he then accidentally dropped his plate of food and it fell to the floor spewing his food all across the floor bloody hell sirius yelled all of a sudden everything got quite and everyone looked at him after a minute everyone went back to their conversations and sirius bent down to pick up his food he was putting it all back on his plate to then throw out as he was picking up his food someone bent down to help him that person ironically was alyssa need some help she said thanks sirius said they then both stood up after all the food was picked up and sirius threw it all away such a shame good food gone to waist sirius said alyssa laughed there was then an awkward silence until alyssa finally broke it so uh how have you been she asked sirius scratched the back of his head pretty

remus look remus looked over to where kendall was mentioning and saw sirius leading alyssa to the dance floor remus then spotted james and lily fairly close to him prongs remus said rather quiet james

was an amass of cracks and pops coming from outside this caused sirius and alyssa to immediately separate and all others were alarmed there was suddenly a burst of light and the front door fell down oh god no james said reaching for his wand in his pocket lily looked up at him and realized what was happening my wand is in my purse lily whispered looking over at a table where her purse was laying what james asked my wand is in my purse she said and pulled her hand away from his running over to her purse lily no james yelled as he watched her vanish through the crowd there was suddenly a loud

well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 45 midsummer night ball part two lily rushed through the crowd with one determination getting her wand she vaguely heard james call her name and knew that she would be a goner for sure if she didnthave her wand james saw lily disappear through the crowd and immediately panicked he was about to run after her until he heard the first scream of course the death eaters were bound to come to his parents party his parents were friends with some of the very important people in the ministry who would obviously come to the party how could they have been so blind everyone whipped out their wands and started fighting back as the death eaters poured in through the front door they all went into battle fighting for their lives for some it was hard due to their binding dresses or tuxedos james had disarmed a few of his opponents and dodged a few spells james had just knocked down and disarmed one of the death eaters when a spell came zooming from behind him and knocked him down james was about to get right back up but decided to be tricky he pretended to be hurt badly and then when his opponent least expected it he jumped back up and yelled stupefy the death eater immediately fell down and james ran to go help the others where was lily lily just reached her purse dodging a few spells on the way she was rummaging through it and finally came to her wand as soon as she got it she turned around preparing to fight and was immediately hit with a spell knocking her down she hit her head on a table and cursed under her breath in pain she then tried to collect herself and fight but her opponent looked like he was in the mood for some fun sirius was dueling with one death eater in particular and then when a wisp of her black hair was seen and sirius looked into her hateful eyes he realized that he was battling his own cousin bellatrix how are you he shouted when sending a hex at her which she deflected i know i was late for the family reunion but did all of you really have to come here to pick me up he asked dodging one of the curses she threw at him you filthy blood traitor bellatrix yelled and sent another curse at sirius dear dear i haventseen you since easter how is my brother doing horrible i hope sirius said sending a hex at her which hit her but only barely giving him the advantage for only a moment regulus is respectable to his family and isnta blood traitor like you bellatrix yelled sending another hex at him well send him all of my hate but oh wait you wontbe able to now will you like you could win a battle against me bellatrix scoffed watch and see beloved watch and see i d like to see you try i am not one of the dark lord favorites for no reason bellatrix yelled whilst sending a curse at sirius he dodged out of the way but it hit his arm leaving a deep gash glad to know someone likes you even if it is ol voldy sirius said and sent a spell at bellatrix conjunctivitis bellatrix cried out in rage you bastard she yelled how are you going to fight me if you cantsee me sirius asked and then sent another spell at her stupefy bellatrix muttered a counter curse and her eyesight was no longer damaged you have a lot to learn she hissed and threw a curse at him crucio sirius wasntfast enough and the spell hit him he kept his mouth closed tightly not giving her the satisfaction of hearing him scream even though his blood felt like it was boiling lily quickly got up but was hit with a curse again knocking her back down what that mudblood too scared to fight back the death eater said lily gritted her teeth and was about to send a spell at him but he was too fast and cast one at her first lily flew up into the air and then with a flick of the death eater wand she went soaring and crashing into the wall she fell down with a thud to the ground james was running around knocking out death eaters dodging spells and trying to find lily he just disarmed one of the death eaters when he saw a sudden flash of red he immediately looked up and saw lily go flying across the room hit the wall and fall to the ground he sprinted her way and just as he was coming close to where she was another sight caught his eye a death eater was advancing on sirius who was lying in pain on the floor within a split second a million thoughts and memories were going through his mind neither death eater would see him coming he could easily save one of them but how could life be so cruel how could he be forced to choose between his best friend and his girlfriend a n sorry for the shortness i guess that this will be in three parts too thanks for all of the awseome reviews you guys rule the next chapter will be up asap thanks again disclaimer i

46 midsummer night ball part three james had to make a decision that split second or else both of their lives would be at risk it was either his best friend or the girl he loved how could someone choose like that james sure couldn t so he didn t even though he knew lily was strong he knew sirius was stronger sirius happened to be closer to him so he knew what he had to do he ran towards lily and at the same time sent a spell zooming at sirius opponent impedimenta james yelled his wand pointing at the death eater advancing on sirius be he kept his eyes straight ahead as he ran towards lily and her opponent the spell he sent at bellatrix wouldnthold her off forever but it was the quickest thing he could think of that didntneed as much concentration plus it would give sirius a chance to collect himself he just entered range of lily attacker he raised his wand and yelled stupefy james spell was successful but unfortunately the second before it hit him the death eater managed to spurt out a curse at lily crucio the death eater yelled and then immediately fell to the ground from james spell lily had just tried to get up and then the spell came zooming at her knocking her back down no james yelled seeing the spell hit lily lily let out a scream as she fell back down to the ground she couldntstand the pain she tried to battle it for as long as she could but then passed out james ran up to her and knelt down besides her lily lily james shouted shaking her shoulders she didntrespond she was limp james put his two fingers to her neck to search for a pulse he found it right away it beating extremely fast knowing that lily was at least alive the voice of reason kicked back in he had to go help the others now he moved lily out of harm way and then ran back over to sirius once

about to run off to go find remus kendall and alyssa but he halted when he heard more cracking and popping this was either a sign that they were going to meet their doom or that they were saved lily blinked a few times adjusting her eyes to the bright light her vision was blurry but she quickly gained her vision back and looked around there were cots everywhere and everything was white she attempted to sit up but a wash of pain overcome her and she let out a groan of pain james was currently sitting in a chair next to her bed dozing in and out but immediately jolted up when he heard a sound come from lily he noticed that her eyes were open and he wanted to jump for joy j james she managed to choke out james bolted over next to her bed knelt down and clutched her hand yeah lils it me james said i was afraid that you were never going to wake up he said trying to hold back his tears where where am i she asked st mungos james said you ve been out for a couple days what happened

bruises and kendall broke a few ribs but they will all be alright alyssa got hit almost as bad as you she woke up yesterday but she fell back asleep sirius is going mad lily gave another nod she then felt james lift her hand which was still clutched in his and kissed it gently then resting it with his on the side of his face lily opened her eyes and turned to her left to see james letting a tear escape from his eye she released her hand from his grip and brought it to the side of his face wiping the tear away with her thumb i okay she said reading james thoughts it my fault he said both you and sirius were in trouble at the same time and i didntknow what to do i wasntfast enough if i had just come to you a second sooner james lily said cutting him off if you wouldnthave come i would have

friends along with lily james kendall remus and sirius stood outside at the cemetery alyssa stood next to her mom leaning on her shoulder crying and sirius stood next to her holding her hand james stood next to lily with his arm around her waist and she leaned into him letting a few tears fall kendall was holding remus hand her cheeks were tear stained after the burial alyssa didntmove she stood looking at the fresh mound of dirt in front of her alyssa i i should go inside mrs reynolds said wiping her eyes with a handkerchief you should come alyssa said in a monotone voice i not coming in mrs reynolds sniffed and nodded dontstay out too late please alyssa stood there still holding on to sirius hand you alright sirius asked he then cursed to himself and said very softly stupid question alyssa knelt down and started to undo the straps of her high uncomfortable shoes what are you doing sirius asked as she released his hand to bend down i just need to get away she said she then stood up and handed sirius her shoes he took them with a confused look on his face i guess i ll be back she said i just need to get away she repeated she then started running off just to get away from everything she ran beyond her limits just to get everything out after what seemed like forever of running she collapsed and let out a river of tears pounding the grass with her fists sirius stood there in a daze not quite sure what just happened or what he should do james then came up to him and saw the confused look on his face and shoes in his hands what up mate james asked concerned alyssa just kind of ran off sirius said james nodded i want to give her some space sirius said yeah james nodded and agreed but i not sure if i should go after her sirius said well usually i would say give her space but with everything that is going on i would go after her and make sure that she alright she shouldntbe out running alone james said shit sirius swore i ve gotta go after her he said do you want me to no i ll be fine she only been gone for a little bit i think she ll be fine sirius said trying to convince himself well if you re sure james said i ve got my mirror if anything happens sirius said you should probably go back with lily sirius said as he jolted his head behind james where lily was leaning up against the fence with a tear stricken face be careful james said as he headed away sirius then ran in the direction that alyssa gone james walked back over to lily what now he asked as he came up to her i haventseen my parents since lily said james just nodded her to continue i owled them but i d like to go home okay james said well i ll take you there so i can make sure you get back safe james said and held out his arm to lily lily forced a half smile and linked her arm through james i have to let my parents know first james said alright lily said how are they doing james let out a breath they re alright my aunt and uncle are still at st mungos so they are still a bit worried about that james paused at the look on lily face dontworry the nurses say that they will be fine he assured her but i suppose that they feel guilty they think it is their fault for whoever died but it isn t lily said well it happened at their party so they feel responsible james said i suppose i could understand that lily said james found his parents and he and lily walked up to them mum dad i gonna take lily home james said are you sure that a good idea mrs potter asked with all of the attacks i think lily would be much safer around other witch and wizards i haventseen my parents since before the ball though i really have to go home lily said well dear of course mrs potter said but why dontyou come back and stay with us for a bit until the attacks are a bit more under control it would be putting your family in jeopardy if you went back lily didntknow how to respond you really think they would be in more danger if i went back home lily asked gripping onto james arm tighter mr potter then joined in the conversation i think it would increase their danger quite a bit he said lily looked pale so james decided to speak mum why donti take lily to her house and she can see her parents and then we can come back to our house to stay so at least she can still see them alright excellent idea mrs potter said is that alright with you dear lily nodded if i wouldntbe intruding or anything i have been staying at your house quite a lot not at all dear mrs potter said dismissing the question with a wave of a hand we would all feel much safer know that you were around trained auror s mrs potter said looking at james james gave an innocent smile thanks mum we ll go now sirius ran off to find alyssa make sure he gets back okay alright james said of course mr potter said thank you lily said and she headed off with james they both walked outside and lily released james arm see you in a second james said lily nodded and they both apparated to lily house as soon as they arrived they both walked up to the door and lily knocked she heard a bit of shuffling and then her mother opened the door oh lily mrs evans said i so happy so see you she said smothering her in a hug are you alright for the most part lily said truthfully oh and james you re here too i so glad you are safe as well mrs potter said ushering the two of them inside where dad lily asked he in the study reading mrs evans said lily nodded mum i ve got to tell you something lily said mrs evans looked worried it alright mum lily said but with the attacks going on james mum said that it would be better for me and for you and dad if i stayed at their house for a while so i could be safer and so could you she added is that really necessary mrs evans asked directing it mostly at james well mrs evans james started with lily here it would increase your chances of being attacked also both of my parents are aurors somewhat like police so lily would be protected mrs evans nodded and both lily and i were excepted to the auror academe as i sure you know james said mrs evans nodded again so since we got mostly outstanding grades we will be starting our training soon and lily would be much better off staying with already highly trained aurors lily looked at james in shock it was as if he had a whole speech planned out but if your house was attacked before who to say it wontbe attacked again mrs evans asked well since the ball an extreme measure of security has been placed around my house which would keep lily even safer james said lily stood there still stunned mrs evans then looked at lily how do you feel about this dear she asked well mum i want you to stay safe and i know that until the attacks die down for a little you will be safer if i not here lily said i can still come visit but you would be safer if i wasnthere mrs evan let out a deep breath if it for the best she said but only if you re sure lily nodded and gave her mother a hug i sure why dontyou go get your things from upstairs and i ll go get your father so we can say goodbye on your way out thanks mum lily said i ll go get my things james will be up in a minute mrs evans said letting lily know to go on ahead lily gave her mother a puzzled look and then turned to james okay she said and then headed upstairs once lily was upstairs mrs evans turned to james james i know you love my daughter very much she said james nodded i do he said keep her safe mrs evans said i promise i will mrs evans you have my word james said mrs evans sniffled and nodded good she said i know she loves you very much and i trust that you will protect her james nodded i d die for her he said she means the world to me mrs evans eyes looked tear filled every mother fear is to see her little girl get swept off her feet by someone and that means that she no longer needs me but it has to happen and i glad that you are the one to steal her heart mrs evans said james felt so proud at that moment thank you he said and lily will always need you dontworry he added mrs evans gave a small smile you can go up with her she said i ll go get her father and fill him in james nodded and headed upstairs to lily room lily had her ear pressed up against her door listening and taking in every word spoken between james and her mother she then heard footsteps and rushed over to her suitcase and quickly summoned her clothes into it james came up the stairs and knocked on her door come in lily called and james came in i almost ready she said james came over and sat down on her bed lily closed her suitcase and sat down next to james i heard what you said to my mum lily said james quickly turned his head to lily he wasntsure if that was a good thing or a bad thing i really mean the world to you she asked of course james said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world lily smiled and leaned her chin on james shoulder you mean the world to me too she said james smiled kissed lily on the forehead and brought her into a hug we should go he said it getting late after a long lecture from lily dad james and lily finally headed off to the potter estate sirius ran after alyssa and finally came across her crouched down on the ground crying her eyes out thank god you re okay sirius said crouching down next to her i just want to be alone right now she said sobbing i know but it not safe for you to be anywhere alone right

right now you have to think of the good things we re okay your dad wouldnthave wanted you to throw everything away you got into the auror academe and now you can do something to stop those horrible people put all of your hate and anger into stopping them he said trying to encourage her she just looked up at him and didntrespond that doesntmean that you cantcry or be upset dontbottle up your feelings just put them to a good use eh alyssa nodded lets get back then it getting dark sirius said alyssa clung onto his arm and let her tears flow freely down her face they walked back to the rest of her family and then sirius got alyssa safely back to her house and then returned to the potter estate lily and james arrived at james house went inside and saw sirius heading up the stairs how alyssa james asked i got her back home so she is okay as she can be i guess sirius said well that good i suppose james said are you two yeah we re back together sirius said with a half smile good for

across the hall to james room and knocked on the partially open door james was lying on his bed staring at the ceiling and then turned his head to the right and smiled lily came into his room she went to the other side of the bed and scooted over next to james she laid down next to him and rested her head between his arm and his chest he put his arm around her and pulled her in closer you okay he asked i guess she said it just scary how short it all is what is he asked life she replied especially in times like these i know what you mean he said lily tapped her fingers on james chest and then

changed into them and took off his shirt he then sat down on the edge of his bed and waited for lily to come back after a few minutes lily returned to james room wearing yellow pajama pants and a white camisole she walked over to his bed her arms crossed and smiled james got under the covers and lily followed suit james flicked his wand and the lights turned off he took off his glasses and

then remus came and kissed kendall on the cheek and sat down next to her vi vad vuch va vaving vor vacon sirius said through a full mouth of food what kendall asked he had such a craving for bacon

library and found lily sitting there with her chin in one hand and her other hand holding her quill staring at her paper not writing anything thought you might need help james said coming up to her she jumped surprised that he actually came though she was really glad since she was in need of a lot of help on her paper thanks i really have no idea what i doing lily said james sat down next to her and explained what she had to do ohhhhhh i get it now thanks lily said she started writing ferociously and as she did this james noticed her perfect handwriting once again lily knew he was looking but didntcare at the moment she was too busy getting her paper finished oh about the ball lily said which immediately caught james attention we donthave to match or anything so you can choose what you want to wear without knowing what i wearing i sure you ll choose something nice lily said and then went back to her paper so do you know what you are wearing yet though james asked hoping to find out maybe but i want it to be a surprise lily said smiling fine fine but your leaving me hanging here james said lily just nudged james with her elbow and went back to work weekend trip to hogsmead see you guys later i going to get my dress kendall you know he needs to breathe lily said rolling her eyes at kendal and remus lily then left her friend and headed off to a little dress shop that not many people knew about so she was sure to find something different from everyone else she was in there once and saw a beautiful green dress she was hoping that it was still there hey lily wait up james yelled running to catch up next to lily hey what up lily said well i was wondering where you are going to get your dress all of the shops are madhouses and i really have no clue where to look james

what you are wearing lily laughed well there is no guarantee that i will show you what i going to buy but i ll at least take you to the store i guess lily said they walked through the crowded streets and turned up a small alley to find a cute little shop here the place lily said wow i had no idea that this was here james said not many people do that why i always come here lily explained as soon as they walked in lily saw the dress that she wanted it was a deep emerald green like her eyes it was strapless fitted but went out a little at the bottom and went to the floor it was velvet with silver sparkles in it and it had a satin bow around the waist lily didntwant james to know what she was wearing yet so she went around and grabbed a few dresses along with the green one to try on why dontyou try that suit over there lily pointed to a grey suit with a slight green trim on the pocket and green buttons hey maybe they could match that might look good okay james said heading over to get it i going to try these on lily said and james nodded lily tried on all of the dresses just for the heck of it and they all fit nice but the green one fit like a glove and brought out all of her best features she finally decided that it really didntmatter if james saw her dress now he was going to see it eventually she came out of the dressing room in the green dress to look in the triple mirror james had already tried on some suits and decided on the grey one lily mentioned he was waiting for her to finish trying on when she came out james was just looking around the store but when he heard her he turned and his mouth dropped open wow he said you look amazing if it possible you look more beautiful then ever james said lily blushed and smiled thanks she said and she looked in the mirror even to herself she looked amazing well i think i found a winner she said then she looked at the price tag caching ug i cantafford this guess i ll just have to wear something from last year she said and walked back into the dressing room james couldntbelieve it she looked so amazing she had to have that dress james family was definitely not tight on money both of his parents had amazing jobs and he lived in a huge house without a doubt he could afford the dress he would buy it for her he would some how come back here and get it for her lily came out of the dressing room hug the dress back up with great regret and started to head out of the store uh i just gonna pay for this i ll catch up with you later james said you sure lily asked yeah go on ahead maybe we can get a butter beer later james said okay sure lily said and walked out once james was sure that she was gone he grabbed the green dress and paid for the dress and his suit disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary

depressed and you know i want to give her some space alright mate we ll let it go james said all four boys drank their firewhisky and then sat there in a comfortable silence after a bit james finally spoke up i think i might wait for a bit longer he said wait for what sirius asked to ask lily to marry me james said why remus asked well every time i ve tried something has come up maybe that a sign telling me to wait james said or a sign that you have sucky timing sirius said the three boys glared at him kidding he said well that not a bad idea remus said but why not just see how things go and ask her at the how should i say opportune moment good idea moony james said when the timing is absolutely perfect they all nodded well i still think i should head back if lily came back early or something i dontwanna leave her alone too long trust me she still at kendall s but you can do what you want remus said i going to assume that she is at my house missing me desperately james said standing up you re an idiot sirius said under his breath what was that padfoot james asked even though he had heard him i said good for you mate sirius said giving a fake smile and two thumbs up i think i know someone else who is an idiot james said you coming with nah i ll stay a bit longer if moony and wormtail are sirius said i staying remus said me too peter said alright then i ll see you

that i shall never drink firewhisky again without knowing that if i do i have given up the right to snog you senseless james said lily put her arms to her sides and rolled her eyes james really james however cut her off by just as he said snogging her senseless when he pulled away lily was left with a very light head weak knees and a racing heart when she opened her eyes she met james who was smiling what was that love james asked nothing lily said and then kissed him james grabbed his arm around lily waist and pulled her in close he then backed up so she was leaning up against the counter after what seemed like forever they broke away their breaths were short and they were touching foreheads lily looked into james eyes but neither said anything james was about to lean down and kiss her again but there was a sudden slam of the front door which caused the two to immediately separate ello prongsie i back sirius yelled james let out an annoyed sound at his crazed friend why hello prongs

lily said a kar nee vol sirius asked yeah it like a festival with rides and games and stuff just to cheer everyone up lily said brilliant idea sirius said we could all use some cheering up he paused

said yes i know what a book is he then paused and i know how to open it too they all laughed and then went outside we ll have to apparate a couple blocks from the carnival so that we wontlook

me dumb sirius asked that a known fact hun alyssa said patting sirius arm sirius scowled at them they finally reached the carnival paid for their tickets and went in so what do you guys want to do

different directions dragging lily and alyssa along with them meet back at the ferris wheel in a half hour lily yelled to them as james pulled her along oh oh what this james asked coming up to a very large game with a bell at the top it a hammer bell lily said you hit it as hard as you can and try to get it to hit the bell alrighty then i trying james said i dontknow mr potter i think you might be too weak lily joked oh yeah james asked well let me assure you miss evans i will be hitting that bell mmhmm sure lily said playfully james huffed over to the game handed the guy his ticket took the hammer and hit the platform as hard as he could sure enough james hit the bell with ease he then turned to lily and grinned triumphantly ha what did i tell ya the guy then handed james a stuffed animal penguin and called up the next player james then walked over to lily and handed her the stuffed animal for you love he said aww lily said taking the stuffed animal you are so sweet she then gave him a kiss on the cheek and linked her arm in his thank you lily said smiling sweetly james grinned at her anything for you love they walked around playing a few more games and then headed for the ferris wheel alyssa and sirius were there and they were still waiting for kendall and remus where do you think they are alyssa asked probably tunnel of love lily said probably alyssa said whatty of what sirius asked nothing lily said sirius and james gave each other quizzical looks soon after kendall and remus showed up looked flustered lily and alyssa exchanged glances and went up to kendall and immediately questioned her where were you mate sirius asked uh just off playing games remus lied that seemed to be a good enough answer because neither of them questioned him what is it with girls and stuffed animals james asked i know i got alyssa a stuffed animal and she totally flipped out same with lily james said kendall just said thanks remus said she didntget all hyper and giddy and thank you profusely sirius asked ah that would be flipping out well yes then remus said so what do you guys want to do now kendall asked as the three girls came up to them i want to ride the big round

lils you flew on my broom james started james be quiet lily said there are muggles here she hissed right he said sorry but dontworry you ll be fine i mean look it not even that high james said looking up in fact the ferris wheel was one of the largest ones that lily had ever seen but compared to flying it wasntextremely high lily gulped alright they all got in line and then got onto the ferris wheel lily and james got on first sirius and alyssa got onto the one behind them and then kendall and remus on the one behind sirius and alyssa lily stomach lurched as they started to rise into the air james gave an exhilarating whoo as the started getting higher he then turned to lily even if it isntflying it is fun he said lily nodded and then shifted in her seat you okay he asked you know i

why dontyou have a problem with them alyssa said because they are behind us and i can not see them sirius said alyssa rolled her eyes and laughed at sirius ridiculous reasoning sirius then got a spark inside his head and pulled out his wand what are you doing alyssa asked worried just having a bit of fun sirius said he then looked at lily and james who had resumed kissing and then looked down at the bottom of the ferris wheel and shot a few sparks out of his wand the ferris wheel immediately stopped and everyone jerked forward which broke apart all of the making out couples sirius alyssa exclaimed lily turned around and saw sirius laughing immensely looking down at the controller of the ferris wheel completely freaking out sirius black what the hell do you think you are doing lily yelled everyone on the ferris wheel turned and looked at lily why is it that every time sirius does something stupid i look like the crazy one lily said to james james turned to sirius padfoot james then gave him a look and sirius huffed and then fixed it so that the ferris wheel was moving again did anyone ever tell you how immature you are alyssa asked did anyone ever tell you how beautiful you

opened her eyes looking at him james she said like she knew that she should be going but james didnttake note and he kissed her again lily tried to protest but she was unsuccessful james pushed lily up against the wall right next to her bedroom door his tongue penetrated her lips and she reached her arms around his neck and twisted his hair around her fingers james arms drifted down her stomach

leaving her breathless you owe me he repeated with an evil grin lily grinned and went off to her room with a familiar butterfly feeling in her stomach after about 30 minutes lily headed downstairs to see james and sirius fighting over the last bread roll guys she shouted they both paused what the bloody hell do you think you are she said then tapped the roll with her wand and it duplicated into two rolls i always liked you lils sirius said and he bit into his roll lily rolled her eyes and gathered some food onto her plate they all finished eating and then went into the front yard well let

head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 53 decisions dumbledore finished his last few words and everyone soaked them in very carefully now that you know what the order does it is up to you if you want to be a part of it dumbledore said if you decided to join the order it would be asked that you return tomorrow at the same time for our first meeting with that his dark purple robes swept behind him as he left the room no one said anything lily glanced around the room and saw many familiar faces she saw kendall remus and alyssa who lily was glad also were invited she also saw alice prewett and her boyfriend frank longbottom she recognized a few people that she knew from hogwarts but she wasntsure of their names she then turned to her right and looked at james he looked back at her with the same blank expression so sirius was the first one to speak guess we should be leaving then james lily kendall remus and alyssa nodded the others in the room joined in as well and then all stood up lily gave a quick wave to alice and frank and then headed out of the pub following james and sirius well i gonna go back and think it over sirius said me too everyone chorused with a few pops everyone was gone james lily and sirius arrived at the potter estate and went upstairs to the sitting room well i in sirius said slumping onto a couch me too james said me too lily said james looked over at lily lily i dontknow if you should donteven try to change my mind james it already made up lily said sirius sighed realized this would be a long argument got up and headed to his room lily it too dangerous james said oh so that makes it okay for you to join and not okay for me no i just want you to be safe james said i being an auror just like you are so how would joining the order make me any less safe aurors dontdo all of the dirty work they just show up in mass numbers and you heard dumbledore at the meeting he said that this would be much more dangerous then just being an auror james said i dontcare i doing it lily said lily i really think you shouldn t why not because i would be too afraid that something would happen to you that why james said raising his voice and i wouldntbe worried that something would happen to you lily said raising her voice too it not the not the same lily finished for him well please inform me of one reason that it not the same lily it just that well i just think it would be too dangerous for you damn it james i can make my own decisions i dontneed you to make them for me i would hope you would trust my own judgment i joining end of discussion lily then turned on her heel and headed for her room james then mentally kicked himself after lily left and went chasing after her i taking it that that didntgo too well sirius said popping his head out of his door james jumped in surprise as he was headed for lily room no it didn t why do you have such a problem with her joining the order sirius asked i dontwant her to get hurt james said i think becoming an auror is a big enough gamble already sirius said i think she hurt that you dontthink she can take care of herself i know she can take care of herself james said defensively well i dontthink she knows that mate sirius said plus the more the merrier sirius said with his usual smile james sighed i guess you re right always am sirius said and then went back into his room james turned to lily door and then walked up to it he knocked lily james go away lily said lily please i sorry there was a pause and then james heard a click from the door signaling that lily had unlocked it james opened the door and saw lily on her bed hugging the penguin that he had won her she placed her wand back on her nightstand you were saying james came over and sat on the end of her bed i sorry lils james said you can take care of yourself and if you want to join then go ahead it ll be great to have you there lily studied him and you re not just saying that no james said he then sighed i wontlie i dontwant you to join because i want you to stay safe but it hard for anyone to stay safe now so it would be better to have you helping to

lily gave a small smile i know she said james then brought lily hand to his mouth and gently kissed it lily smiled i ll be up in a minute she said and then headed to the staircase sirius sat at his desk writing to alyssa and kendall he just sealed the letters and attached them to his owl james sat at his desk finishing up his letters while lily stood beside him leaning against his chair and twirling his hair around in her finger this made it extremely difficult for james to concentrate he kept getting little electric shocks from lily touch he finally finished and sent off the letters after his owl flew off he sat back on his chair and pulled lily down with him so that she was sitting on his lap james tucked some of her hair behind her ear and smiled you really do love me lily said of course i love you you know that james said i know lily said she turned away for a minute but then turned back to him and looked right at him but i can tell it from your eyes james grinned really yup lily said putting her hand on the side of his face and looking into his eyes she smiled and then leaned her head against his shoulder james held her tighter and they just sat there for what seemed like the longest time until they were finally broken form their trance from a tapping on the window james picked up lily in his arms she gave a bit of an oof as he did so and then placed her feet on the ground so she was standing up he walked over to the window and took the notes from the two owls that had just arrived lily came over to him to question him about their responses what d they say lily asked remus said that he and kendall are joining but they already had plans tonight james said and then he took the other note and pete busy too sirius came into james room and walked over to them kendall and moony are busy but alyssa said that she joining the order and that she can come tonight great james said yeah wormtail is busy too right then just the four of us shall we head off sirius said i ready lily said it a miracle sirius hollered lily scowled at him come on let go james said and they all headed to the front yard and then apparated to three broomsticks they met up with alyssa and went to get a booth james went up to the bar to order butter beers and then he came back with one for everybody cheers sirius said and good luck to all of us cheers the rest of them replied they all sipped their drinks and then indulged into conversation it great that we will all be in this together alyssa said too right you are sirius said yeah lily said and i glad that alice and frank are there too i heard that they are engaged james cursed himself for not bringing the ring really alyssa asked yeah they are so good together lily said sirius and james nodded in agreement yeah frank

waiting for you scarlet took james hint said goodbye and headed back over to the bar once she left alyssa turned to sirius who was that she asked no one we just uh met here a while ago sirius said not looking alyssa in the eye lily let out a half cough half laugh sirius looked at her in a pleading way not to say anything when did you meet her alyssa questioned not satisfied with his previous answer uh july or something right after we broke up alyssa questioned the day after sirius said meekly alyssa eyes got big you shagged her didntyou no sirius said a little too quickly you bastard alyssa said in a whispered voice what it not like james never slept with anyone when he was waiting for lily to come around sirius said grasping at straws unfortunately those were most definitely the wrong straws to grasp at james eyes widened at sirius comment and lily jaw partially dropped james looked over at her to try to say something but no words came to him lily wouldntlook at him she stood up and threw her napkin on the table then she walked quickly to the door and walked outside james was in a state of shock and couldntmove alyssa turned to sirius and slapped him you re an idiot she then got up and followed lily outside james turned to sirius who too had a shocked expression on his face james then kicked him hard under the table sirius winced but didntsay anything knowing he deserved it are you stupid do you hate me i just saved your arse back there i got scarlet to go away you idiot she is never going to talk to me again what the bloody hell were you thinking james got up and ran after lily sirius sat there in shock for a minute and then followed james out the door james barely caught sight of lily before she apparated he called her name and she looked over at him for a split second and then she was gone although it was only for a second it was long enough to see the tears that were running down lily cheeks james turned to sirius and gave him a look of pure disgust he then apparated to his house lily ran up to her room and immediately began packing her trunk james ran upstairs as soon as he got back home and barged into lily room knocking as he entered lily where are you going james asked seeing her packing her suitcase she didntrespond or look at him lily you cantleave and you canttell me what to do lily yelled at him lily closed her suitcase and grabbed it in one hand lily will you just lily turned around and threw her stuffed animal penguin at him and then pushed past him and walked out of her room james chased after her and grabbed onto her arm lily please you

dangerous lily paused and then said no you know what right now what i cantdo is look at you she then apparated leaving james standing stunned in confusion hurt and worry he had to get her back it was

or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 55 the whole story james went into a fit a million thoughts went through his mind as he saw lily pop out of sight where did she go is she going home is she going to her friends what if she going somewhere i dontknow how am i going to get her back how am i going to apologize oh merlin how am i going to explain everything to her wait wait i just have to get her back first where could she have gone james paced around his front yard thinking of the places lily could have gone he knew that she would be mad at him but he had to make sure that she was back at his house and safe from all of the attacks he took a deep breath and made a mental list of all the places lily could have gone lily arrived in front of her house and knocked on the door her mother answered the door and immediately smothered lily with a hug oh lily it so good to see you we ve missed you so much how are you mrs evans said lily felt very guilty for not visiting her parents as much as she should have i alright mum lily said then a thought just hit her how could i be so stupid this is the first place james is going to come and look for me great well i guess i ll go off to kendall s come in mrs evans said pulling lily inside lily went into her house and put down her bag how are things with er moldyvort is that it lily almost laughed at her mother mistake but realized whom she was talking about well not so good actually lily said i really shouldntbe here but you see james and i had a bit of a spat and i needed to get away for a bit lily said rushing oh dear what happened lily pondered a moment and then spoke it fine dontworry but i really need to talk to kendall right now if james comes by donttell him i there please just tell him i okay mrs evans eyed her suspiciously really mum i fine i ll be back later for my things lily assured her mother mrs evans sighed alright but please have the next visit more then a few minutes we miss you lily smiled and hugged her mother alright she said and if james comes by please donttell him i at kendall s just tell him i safe lily i really dontlike the sounds of that mrs evans said sternly mum i fine i promise lily assured her mother there was then a crack and a pop from outside lily saw from out the window a figure a little ways down her block that resembled james she couldntlook at him right now lily turned to her mother please mum she said she then gave her a hug and apparated mrs evans stood there slightly confused and then there was a loud knock on the door she opened it to find a very distraught looking james and suddenly realized the reason for her daughters sudden fleeing hello mrs evans is lily here james said in a rushed out of breath tone i sorry dear you just missed her mrs evans said trusting her daughters words james let out a frustrated grunt did she say where she was going james asked hopefully she did but i have been given orders not to tell you where mrs evans said regretfully james cranked his neck back and put his hands behind his head he then looked back down at mrs evans could you please tell me i really need to talk to her he begged mrs evans sighed as much as i would like to tell you james i have never been given a reason not to trust my daughter and she has made it apparent that she doesntwant you to know where she is james looked as though he was going to have a breakdown she has however told me to assure you that she is safe mrs evans said james looked at her hopefully she said that you are sure you are sure that she safe yes she made sure for me to tell you that mrs evans said mrs evans if she comes back here can you tell her that i sorry and that i ll be waiting for her at my house where she is guaranteed to be safe i will make sure of it mrs evans said thanks so much mrs evans james said mrs evans smiled and james turned away from her house just before lily mom shut the door james turned back to her to add one more thing and tell her that i love her tell her that i really love her james said lily knocked on kendall door hoping that she was back from wherever she was with remus kendall came to the door slightly flustered and opened it when she saw the look on lily face she immediately became concerned lily what wrong she asked can i talk to you lily asked sure come in remus is here can he can i talk to you alone he doesnthave to leave or anything just for a few minutes i cantstay long anyway of course come in lily entered kendall house and saw remus coming into the room lily gave a quick small smile and ran up the stairs just give me a few minutes kendall said to remus she seems really upset remus nodded take your time i ll wait down here kendall smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before following lily up the stairs lily flopped down on kendall bed and kendall came to sit down next to lily what wrong lils kendall asked lily then explained the whole story to kendall kendall looked at lily and then finally spoke i dontthink you should be that hard on him kendall said what lily you guys werenteven going out kendall reasoned kendall james had as you know due to public announcements liked me since 1st year and he has been asking me out since 5th year he swears that he has loved me since then it just really hurts that he obviously didn t if he went off and slept with some bimbo well kendall said searching for the right words but lily cut her off i guess it just hurts the most that he lied to me i mean he told me that he loved me since then which he obviously didn t and that he is stupid enough to go off with one of hogwarts sluts lily said i guess i can see that kendall said but lily you know that he loves you so why should it matter it just i just feel so dirty like he already slept with lily trailed off not wanting to say anything more ah so you two have lily nodded sheepishly kendall sort of looked away with a smile playing on her lips have you lily said loudly switching the spotlight to kendall well i let not change the subject we are supposed to be talking about you and james lily gave a satisfied smile knowing that kendall didntwant to admit it alright alright lily said satisfied with kendall nonverbal answer i think you should talk to him kendall said i cantkendall i can t lily said why not i canteven look at him lily said kendall sighed well at least let him know you are okay she said he must be having a fit he is i went to my house before i came here and i left cause i saw him coming lily evans kendall said how could you do that he is probably going out of his mind just then there was a knock on the door and remus voice came from behind it can i come in he asked yeah come in kendall said remus entered the room um sirius just owled me he said that james is going crazy looking for lily remus said looking at lily he wants to know if we know where she is kendall shot her a i told you so look you don t lily said remus looked confused i going to my house to get my things and then i will go back to his house lily said he will probably be searching everywhere it will give me some time alone remus looked confused did i miss something he asked you think kendall said not in a mean but rather obvious tone did you guys have a fight remus asked you could say that lily said standing up thanks kendall dontworry i ll talk to him eventually thanks she then said goodbye and left apparating to her house lily arrived once again at her house and knocked on the door her mother came and greeted her sorry mum i only came by to get my things i promise i ll stop by again soon as an actual visit lily said mrs evans sighed oh alright but honey james stopped by after right after you left lily grabbed her bag not looking at her mother he asked me to tell you that he is very sorry he wants you to come back to his house and that he love you very much mrs evans said lily turned to look at her mother i am going back there mum i cantstomach to talk to him yet but in the bigger picture it is safer for me there lily said dear what did you have a fight about he seems so sorry and you can tell that he loves you so what could have possibly gotten you so frantic mrs evans asked lily took a deep breath not about to share the details of her personal life to her mother well mum let just say that the past is catching up and i need some time to handle some facts and get them straight lily said mrs evans gave her daughter a hug lily whatever it may be that you re upset about just take a deep breath and talk to him about it he seems to be falling apart without you and although it is hard to say it i know that you two really love each other and more importantly i know he is crazy about you talk to him alright i will lily said just give me some time alright dear mrs evans said be careful lily then apparated back to the potter estate lily opened the door and crept upstairs she was almost to her room but then sirius came walking out of his bloody hell evans sirius yelled busted do you know how bloody crazy james has been going looking for you sirius asked yes actually i do lily said and you are back here because i figured it was the last place he d look for me and i need some time to myself before i can actually talk to him lily said lily you know that it was my fault not james so dontbe mad at him sirius said lily was in shock that was the first time lily could actually remember sirius calling her lily true it is your fault but now i know so i cantbe completely mad at you you are always doing stupid things no offense lily said none taken sirius said but you should really talk to him once i have the stomach to look at him then i ll think about talking to him lily said sirius sighed seeing he would get nowhere please donttell him i here lily said you cantjust expect me to not tell him you are here when he been searching high and low looking for you sirius said yes i can lily said listen i promise i ll talk to him i just cantdo it yet just tell him that i am perfectly safe sirius let out a frustrated noise oh fine fine fine fine he said thanks she said yeah no problem sirius said regretfully knowing james would have it in for him lily headed to her room and passed james room right before she go to her own she took a look and saw his messy room and bed getting a sick feeling thinking of james being with someone else she went inside her room and threw herself down on her bed an even sicker feeling came to her is this how james felt every time i was going out with someone else lily dismissed the thought trying not to think anything about it a while later lily heard james come up the stairs and knock on sirius door did you get an owl back from moony he asked nope sirius said truthfully dontworry mate she fine i promise dontstress out she needs some time alone right now oh and how would you know this is all your bloody fault you know james said yeah but just trust me she safe sirius said that what her mum said too but no one will tell me where she is james said he then paused and turned back to sirius have you seen her he asked uh yes sirius said lily wanted to throttle him she was stationed very near her door so she could hear every word bloody hell when where do you know where she is prongs chill out mate she fine she just wants to be alone right now so just take a deep breath she will talk to you when she ready james let out a frustrated noise and kicked the wall padfoot just please tell me where she is i need to talk to her i need her to know how much i love her i know that i screwed up before but i need her to know that i love her i need to tell her i sorry james yelled lily opened her door to find james back facing her and sirius acknowledge her presence you just did mate sirius said and then went into his room closing the door james looked slightly puzzled and then turned around to see lily standing in the doorway with tears running down her face james stood there very shocked lily was right in his house being the last place he would look for her bloody hell lily james said barely above a whisper he was about to have a rampage about looking all over for her but he knew that he had more important things to say then that lily i so sorry i know i heard lily said james realized that it would be pretty hard for someone not to hear his recent yelling listen lily i know that you probably dontwant to talk to me right now but i really am sorry and i really wish you didnthave to find out that way me too lily said it just you know i guess i always knew i just didntwant to believe it so i convinced myself that it wasn t lily said cutting him off lily james said taking a step closer to her you know how much i love and care about you you even said so this morning i know lily said it just hurts that you lied all those years what you mean about not telling you no i mean about saying you loved me and then going off with some other girl lily said it not like you were giving me the time of day you obviously didntfeel the same way back james said so you go off with someone else you re not supposed to do that with someone unless you really care about them jeez james i thought you used to be low but never that low i guess the players of hogwarts really did have a meaning behind it after all lily i know i was stupid i know that i did stupid things in my past but my past isntwhat happening now this is what happening now i dontthink you should judge me on something that happened in 5th year you were 15 lily asked james hit himself on his forehead actually i was 16 it was the end of the year james explained in a small voice oh ho big difference lily said she then gasped do you mean at the end of the year after owls right after you were torturing snape why does she have to be so smart yes james said oh i cantbelieve you did you even like me all those years or were you just asking me out to annoy me lily asked merlin lily i have loved you since the first time i ever saw you since the first time i saw you on the hogwarts express i just didntrealize it until then and for goodness sake you know that i love you now then why d you do it then because james stressed i was stupid and immature james explained i was trying to convince myself that i didntlike you anymore i was trying to move on because you wouldnttalk to me or look at me or speak to me in any way the only thing you would do was hex me because you hexed me first lily it doesntmatter we never got along until 7th year it a known fact we have to deal with it i have made my great share of mistakes i admit to it can you suck up your pride and forgive me i canttake it back all i can do is say i sorry james yelled lily was a bit taken back she then stood up straight i know she said but put yourself in my position what if you found out that i had slept with someone else james eyes widened at the thought you didn t did you see you see lily said and no i haven t james let out a breath of relief yeah i see you were the first and only james i just wish i could have been the same for you lily said but lily you mean so much more to me then that it is like you are my first and only because that wasntthe real me this is that was the stupid arrogant immature me not the real me you mean so much to me and you just i mean you are i love you so much lily sighed just let me be alone for a little bit okay sure james said just are we do you

decided to have it at frank house which was rather large and have a smaller crowd then a usual wedding they walked into the room grinning as everyone cheered and took pictures they had invited their family friends and order members speeches were made and everyone cheered as they cut the cake lily walked over and congratulated alice and started chatting with her james sat at their table sirius next to him watching her chatting laughing and grinning you know padfoot one day real soon that gonna be me and lily up there james said prongs you ve been saying that for months sirius said just get over it and ask her already you know you re right yes i know no more waiting heck why donti just go up and ask her right now james said starting to stand up sirius put his hand on james shoulder and

alyssa sirius paused and looked over where alyssa was standing talking to kendall nah he said i do love her but i dontthink that even though i love her i d ever be ready to get married ever in your

taking a drink the dancing was starting i gonna go find moony james walked over to lily and she excused herself from alice who was soon bombarded with hugs and gifts from others as soon as lily left care to dance james asked i d love to lily said smiling james grabbed her hand and then twirled her around on the dance floor lily laughed and james then pulled her in tightly so how are you on this lovely evening james asked in a gentlemen tone just fine and yourself lily replied james grinned and then gave lily a small kiss on the lips you know this is much better then the last wedding i went to no evil stepsister marrying a hideous whale lily said indeed james agreed twirling lily around and much more comfortable shoes lily said looking down at her almost insignificant heels james laughed and smiled thinking and the next wedding will be ours there were suddenly some loud cheers coming from the other side of the dance floor and it seemed that sirius had gotten to the dancing not only had he gotten to the dancing but he dragged alyssa on the dance floor with him after a while of uncontrollable dancing remus finally convinced sirius to stick to water for the rest of the night everyone decided to leave rather early to be safe and went to say goodbye to frank and alice james lily sirius and alyssa walked out kendall remus and peter were still inside saying goodbye sirius said goodbye to alyssa and she apparated to her house james stood by lily and was saying goodnight i know you ve been spending more time at your parents house lately but do you want to stay over

linked her arm through james so where are we going lily asked i thought we d just go for a walk maybe end up at the park or something james said sounds good to me lily said they walked through lily neighborhood with the autumn leaves falling all around them lily turned around when she thought she heard something but saw nothing but the falling leaves behind her did you hear something she asked nope james said probably just the leaves lily said james nodded and then stopped walking causing lily to stop walking too he turned to face her and took both of her hands in his as the knot in his stomach got larger and larger lily i have loved you since the moment i laid eyes on you ever since our first kiss every day of my life has been nothing but happiness every moment i with you is bliss

stood there looking down at james who was holding her hand and a gorgeous ring he had a smile spread across his face but she could tell from his eyes that he was nervous who wouldntbe within a split second a million memories came flooding back to her her breath was caught in her throat and she remembered first year lily walked onto the hogwarts express and found an empty compartment she sat down and read through some of her school books hoping not to be the only one who didntknow any magic not too long after that a girl with blonde hair came into her compartment um hi i kendall do you mid if i sit here she asked sure lily said with a smile happy to meet someone i lily the two girls chatted for a while and talked about what they expected from hogwarts then there was a loud noise coming from outside their compartment lily got up and walked outside to see what was going on when she walked out of her compartment she found two boys one with black hair falling in his face the other with uncontrollable black hair and glasses they were both laughing like crazy it seemed that they had put a dung bomb down a slimly looking boy robes lily was furious she knew how it felt to get made fun of ever since receiving her hogwarts letter her sister and her were no longer on good terms she stormed over to them and raised her voice leave him alone the boy with black hair falling in his face turned around his grey eyes examining the girl who just spoke to him and who might you be he asked does it matter why are you picking on him lily said because he a slimy git that why he said so that

and continued on her way to the library oh come on evans just give me a chance james said i dontlike you and i never will she said now if you ll excuse me i have to go meet your friend in the library thank god he is nothing like you james stood there and watched her walk away then the prankster within him couldntresist he conjured a bucket of water and slowly levitated it over lily head and just as she was turning the corner splash lily let out a scream as the water poured over her james was in hysteria sorry evans i couldntresist you look so cute when you re wet uh leave me alone james potter never come near me again she yelled and then stormed off james then grinned if the only attention he could get from her was pranking her then so be it breathe third year lily sat in the common room reading a book keeping warm by the fire it was snowing outside and most third years and above were going to hogsmead but not lily she enjoyed the quiet if only the quiet could last longer why hello evans james potter voice came from behind her and a pair of hands came from behind her and covered her eyes guess who lily grabbed his hands from off her eyes and shoved them back to him she then turned around in her chair to face him disgusted get away from me potter she said aw come on i was wondering if you fancied a trip to hogsemead with yours truly james said leave me alone potter lily said turning back to her book ah but you haventanswered my question james said taking a seat across from her lily looked up from her book no she said no i dontwant to go to hogsmead with you what is your problem you prank me everyday hex people in the halls for the fun of it and then you just expect me to go to hogsmead with you lily said well yeah james said you know i find you enticing evans seeming immune to the potter charm when i know that deep down you long for me lily grabbed her book and threw it at him hitting him square on the head ow james said rubbing his head nice aim evans leave me alone or i ll make you lily said her eyes flashing james looked in her eyes saw anger and hate remember what remus said remember what remus said dontpush her beyond her limits alright he said and got up to leave you re just going to leave just like that she asked yup he said but then once again the inner prankster got the best of him but i dontthink you re going anywhere he said with a smirk on his face what lily said so long evans hope you ll reconsider next time james said and walked out of the common room lily was confused but disregarded and went to get up to get her book only she couldntmove she was stuck to the chair lily panicked she couldntmove her arms were stuck to the armrests so she couldnteven get her wand ahhhhhh potter get your arse back here lily yelled but he was already gone james smirked as he heard her scream from inside the common room breathe fourth year lily sat outside by the lake leaning against a tree basking in the sun it was warm out and the water was looking refreshing but it was early spring and the water would be freezing so she sat there put her homework aside and just soaked up the sun oh evans uh lily thought this is unreal why why always when i am in such a good mood why hello evans lovely day out isntit james said sitting down next to lily ruffling his hair you know i ve got to hand it to you potter you are the only one who could turn my mood so foul on such a lovely day lily said gathering her stuff getting ready to stand up but james tugged on her arm preventing her from getting up what the rush james asked potter let go of me lily said come on why wontyou just give me a chance although i d rather going in a broom closet i d settle for a civil conversation james said i ll tell you what lily said you stop being such an arrogant egotistical prat and stop hexing people and dontdump your girlfriends every couple days then i ll have a civil conversation with you lily said standing up so tomorrow then james said lily laughed you wish she said and then started to walk away unfortunately james just happened to stick his foot out as she started to walk lily tripped and fell into the freezing lake lily screamed from both the cold and the realization james couldnthelp but smile i told you i thought you looked so cute when you re wet he said lily dragged herself out of the water and walked right up to him she seriously considered slapping him but instead found away to hurt him even more i hate you potter she said and then walked away dripping wet she glanced back and indeed james looked like he had just been slapped breathe fifth year leave him alone james and sirius looked around james free hand jumped to his hair all right evans said james his tone of voice sounding more pleasant and mature leave him alone lily repeated she was looking at james with every sign of dislike what he done to you well said james appearing to deliberate the point it more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean people surrounding them laughed lily couldntbelieve that james was torturing snape again well actually she could you think you re funny she said coldly but you re just and arrogant bullying toerag potter leave him alone i will if you go out with me evans said james quickly go on go out with me and i ll never lay a want on old snivelly again lily saw snape starting to move behind james reaching closer to his wand but didntlet him know i wouldntgo out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid said lily bad luck prongs said sirius briskly turning back to snape oy snape had sent a spell towards james and a gash appeared on the side of his face splattering his robes with blood james however shot right back and snape was hanging upside down revealing his graying underwear everyone roared with laughter lily furious expression twitched for an instance but she didntsmile let him down certainly said james and he jerked his wand upward snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground sirius then sent a curse speeding his way and he was rigid as a board leave him alone lily shouted she reached for her wand james and sirius eyed it warily ah evans dontmake me hex you said james earnestly take the curse off him then james sighed deeply then turned to snape and muttered the countercurse there you go he said as snape struggled to his feet again you re lucky evans was here snivellus i dontneed help from filthy little mudbloods like her lily blinked fine she said coolly i wontbother in the future and i d wash your pants if i were you snivellus apologize to evans james roared at snape his wand pointed threateningly at him i dontwant you to make him apologize lily shouted rounding on james you re as bad as he is what yelped james i d never call you a you know what messing your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you ve just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid snitch walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can i surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it you make me sick she turned on her heel and hurried away evans james shouted after her hey evans lily kept walking and didntlook back what is it with her said james trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him reading between the lines i d say she thinks you re a bit conceited mate said sirius right said james who looked furious now right breathe sixth year lily was patrolling the corridors she had already caught three couples in broom closets and ducked house points she was heading back to the gryffindor common room when she saw someone through the window she walked over to look out of the window and saw someone in a hooded cloak walking on the grounds lily had to make sure this student was caught they were after all outside of the castle after hours she headed outside and started following the cloaked person not giving herself away yet because she wanted to find out where they were going after following for a bit they had reached the whomping willow lily was very puzzled as the cloaked stranger started at the tree because everyone knew how dangerous it is she was about to give herself away but heard a noise coming from behind her she turned around but saw nothing then when she turned back the hooded figure disappeared into a secret passage way in the whomping willow lily ran and caught up noticing that the tree seemed to be frozen still she ran through the passageway and cast a spell forward causing the person to trip hey what are you doing out after snape what are you doing you cantbe out after hours you re a prefect your shift ended a long time ago get away evans i finally get to figure out where black and potter and that other one sneak off to every month snape said heading on forward i ll be telling dumbledore on this if you dontcome back right now lily warned before snape could respond someone came rushing down the tunnel and ran right into lily snape get out of lily james yelled in surprise his heart started beating like crazy lily was under the whomping willow and there was a werewolf down the hall potter what are you doing lily asked lily you have to get out of here now james yelled donttell me what to do potter i saw someone walking out here so i followed them and found out it was him said lily pointing to snape he said something about you and black sneaking out lily said crossing her arms though i wouldntput it past you james let out a frustrated noise lily you have to get out of here sirius planned this to hurt snape because he was talking about him and his family again it a trap james said then turning to snape you have to get out of here too oh like i can believe you black said i d finally get to find out what you idiots were doing on your little escapades snape said since when have you ever believed him james asked since when have i ever believed you potter snape shot back james turned to lily and grabbed her by the shoulders you have to get out of here you re going to get hurt i cantlet that happen potter what are you talking lily started there was suddenly a scratching and banging noise coming from somewhere james turned and snape had scampered off his eyes got wide in horror and he turned back to lily he put his hands on the side of her face and looked into her eyes lily please go back to the castle get dumbledore he ll know what to do lily was going to protest but she looked back at james and saw the sincerity in his eyes so she stayed silent lily please just trust me even if for only once just trust me james pleaded okay lily said softly james let go of her run lily ran towards the exit and james ran in the other direction after snape lily was almost at the exit and then she ran right into sirius evans what are you doing here is james and snape they are back there he told me to go get dumbledore what going on lily said go get dumbledore sirius yelled peter then caught up with sirius out of breath you too pete for some reason lily knew james wasntlying and she and peter ran to get dumbledore lily came running back to the whomping willow with peter and dumbledore just as they arrived sirius came running out of the passageway followed by james who was dragging snape along with him something was gaining on them from inside the tree with a wave of his wand dumbledore closed the passage and whatever it was chasing after them was out of sight lily ran over to them dumbledore followed and peter trailed behind as lily reached them sirius and james were in a uproar prongs i so so sorry i didntmean for that to happen you know i would never sirius started but couldntfinish james instead cut him off and punched him lily ran over to james not questioning his actions knowing that how close sirius and james were sirius probably deserved it lily was about to ask him what that bloody hell just happened but then she saw the cuts on his face are you alright mister potter profesor dumbledore said coming over to them madame pomfrey came hurrying out of the castle and rushed over to sirius and snape profesor it was just that we sirius james started dumbledore held up his hand i can tell that you are very tired mr potter and you need your rest we will however discuss this in my office tomorrow eight o clock yes sir james nodded now if you will excuse me i shall accompany mr snape and mr black to the hospital wing miss evans i would as that you come to my office tomorrow also sir she doesntknow james quickly cut in dumbledore looked at james his eyes twinkling knowing exactly what james meant alright then your presence will not be needed miss evans i trust you two can find your way back to the gryffindor common room both lily and james nodded good i ll come back later to help solve our little problem dumbledore said nodding his head towards the whomping willow lily and james headed to the common room neither saying a word james kept trying to talk to lily but couldntfigure out what to say first when they finally reached the dormitory stairs james had to say something without restraint james walked up to lily and engulfed her in a hug never scare me like that again he said then pulled back and walked up to his dormitory lily stood there very shocked and played back the events in her head something scared james beyond belief james saved snape life james hugged her and she didntrefuse and not once did he try to impress her or call her evans breathe seventh year then they waltzed around the yard in the rain laughing soaking wet after a while james stopped dancing lily was a little confused listen lily i just want to thank you for everything for giving me a second chance your friendship your but james was cut off just as james was about to thank her for something else she leaned forward and kissed him passionately on the lips james couldntbelieve it he had to be dreaming but even if he was he had to savor this moment he kissed her back more passionately and grabbed her around the waist and pulled her towards him she put her arms around his neck pulling herself even closer lily felt herself melt in james arms and if it wasntfor his arms holding her she would have fallen down after a while they finally pulled away from each other james still standing there holding lily in his arms lily still standing there in james arms her arms around his neck it was getting very cold outside and the rain started to turn into snow james grabbed lily hand come on let go james said pulling lily inside both of them running freezing cold and soaking wet they ran all the way up to the heads room and went inside near the fireplace to get warm james still couldntquite register everything that just happened did did that really just happen james said did we and then did you and then but once again james was cut off lily leaned up and kissed him softly on the lips yes we and then i lily said with a laugh james laughed and then smiled you better get changed you re shaking like a leaf he said to lily okay you too lily said they both slowly hesitated and then left for their rooms to get change lily couldntbelieve what she just did but she knew it was the right thing to do she has fallen for james potter and now has fully admitted it she changed into soft yellow pajama bottoms and a matching long sleeve top she then put her hair up in a messy bun and put on her white slippers james couldntbelieve what happened either did lily evans lily evans just kiss him twice she did she most certainly did james was overcome with joy he actually won her over he had gotten the girl of his dreams but wait he didntask her out yet what if she said no james quickly got into black pajama bottoms a grey t shirt and ran out of his room he went up to lily room and knocked on her door she opened it and then james quickly kissed her taking her by surprise then he asked will you go out with me james rushed down to the great hall and caught up with lily she didntnotice him right away so she was a bit shocked when he showed up he grabbed her arm pulled her out of the crowd and pulled her towards him and kissed her taking her completely by surprise when he finally let her go lily was out of breath jeez james you scared me half to death lily said james then spun her around and put his hands over her eyes james what are you doing she said struggling a bit but not too much i have a surprise for you he said and then led her to the heads room with his hands still over her eyes oh come on james what is this she said very anxious just a bit further he said then they reached the angel it slid aside for him james had mad previous arrangements for the angel not to ask for the password aloud and then he led lily into the heads common room he walked her in his hands still over her eyes he placed her in just the right spot and then he removed his hands lily let out a huge gasp overtaken by a mass array of lilies uh this is so frustrating lily said sitting on one of the couches in the heads room studying for her newts what james asked sitting next to her how am i supposed to remember all of this stuff i ll do fine in charms but this transfiguration stuff is so difficult lily said calm down you ll do fine you always do james said lily just let out a groan and plopped her head down on the pile of books in her lap doooooo you want me to help you james asked no it fine you already helped me enough with transfiguration i hopeless lily said her head still face down on her pile of books not like that james said then like what lily said not realizing james hinting as soon as she lifted her head off of her book pile james full on kissed her lily was very surprised but also very happy she let out a little moan as james kissed her and she ran her fingers through his hair as he pushed her back a little further on the couch she didntcare a bit that her books had fallen off of her lap and were now sprawled across the floor after a while james finally pulled back lily eyes were still closed and when she opened them her eyes met james james was looking at her smiling still kind of on top of her and said now did that help james asked still smiling very much lily said well are you still feeling a bit overwhelmed james asked lily caught his hinting this time maybe a little she said smiling james gave a big grin and then kissed her again breathe that summer they arrived back in the potter front yard james knew that his parents were and an auror meeting so he had nothing to worry about james looked over to lily who was grinning she then gave him a quick kiss on the lips and then started running to the house yelling over her shoulder catch me if you can a grin spread over james face and he immediately started running after her even though james legs were much longer then lily s she gave him a bit of a run for his money he chased her up the stairs and when he reached the top he lunged out for her hand which he caught and pulled her back causing her to spin inward towards him their lips immediately met but then lily pushed james off playfully and started running again james chased her all the way down the hallway to his room when they got there james once again seized lily hand and pulled her towards him causing them again to kiss james put his hand up to lily cheek and deepened the kiss after a while she broke away again and ran over to his bed bouncing down on it and kicked her shoes off james came right after her kicking his shoes off as he came over to her leaning over her at that moment he just bathed in her beauty he had always know how lucky he was to be with lily but he then realized that he was the luckiest guy in the world to be with lily he then leaned down and kissed her with more passion then he even knew was possible he could have stayed there kissing her forever but realized what he was getting to was even better he finally broke away and gazed into her eyes realizing all over again how lucky he was he then started to pull her shirt off over her head and then continued kissing her until she helped him off with his shirt too james half expected sirius to come bursting into his room for some unknown reason but luckily there was no disturbance james reached down to help lily off with her skirt as did lily with his pants after they skimmied out of the rest of their clothes it was nothing but them and that was just fine lily walked towards the lake completely soaked from the pouring rain and saw james standing soaked and staring out at the lake she walked up fairly close behind him but didntsay anything james knew that someone was there he could sense them he then inhaled and could tell by the sweet smell in the air that it was lily he turned around and looked at her for a brief moment and then looked down and turned back to the lake they stood there for a very long time in an uncomfortable silence until james finally spoke did you want something or did you just come here to stare at the back of my head he said dryly still facing the lake lily walked over to him and slapped him on the shoulder i came to say i sorry but now i rethinking it lily yelled oh crap james thought how could you do something like that to me lily said how could you do a spell and illegal one and then not

bloody birthday james james searched for words but none came out you say you love me but you keep doing these things and all you do is keep hurting me lily yelled i do love you james said in a small voice well nice way of showing it lily yelled i cantbe with someone who doesnttrust me and right now it clear that you don t james just stood their dumbstruck soaking in lily words i not seeing this working lily yelled almost not believing what she was saying james eyes widened no lily please no james said shaking his head i cantbe with you if you canttrust me lily said i can deal with you being immature doing stupid things that you know you shouldn t but when you do something like that and not tell me i cantdeal with that james couldntbelieve what he was hearing he knew that he did those sorts of things but he never realized how much it affected lily he grabbed lily by the shoulders lily i cantlive without you he said releasing a few tears that he had been holding in his eyes lily pulled away james slowly let his hands down back to his sides feeling like lily just ripped out his heart and stepped on it lily looked back over at james and into his eyes his look of pure hurt made her want to die she couldntstand to see him like that even though she was angry as hell with him she watched him rain falling all around him looking like he was just about to curl up and die you need to be able to trust me lily said softly james looked like he had some life back in him when he heard her talk again i cantbe with you if you don t if you don t lily stuttered letting a few tears fall i ll do whatever you want james said in a pleading way i ll change i ll do anything i cantloose you you need to trust me you need to tell me when you screw up so something like this doesnthappen again you just need to tell me the truth lily said i promise james said nodding his head lily nodded turned and started walking away james couldntwatch her walk away he knew that it would jeopardize things even more they already were but he had to he ran up behind her grabbed onto her arm and pulled on it spinning lily towards him their lips immediately met and james pulled lily in close lily knew that she had just fought with james but she would do anything to be in his arms kissing him again and here she was lily clung onto james shirt and deepened the kiss james put his arms around her waist and pulled her even closer lily reached her arms up so they were around his neck and she pulled herself up lily ran her fingers through his hair and he reached further down her back james then lifted lily up a bit and then started to lean towards her until the gracefully fell slowly to the ground a little after they fell james pulled away and looked down at lily they both breathed heavily slightly breathless and stared into each other eyes lily i love you so much and i am so sorry james said lily looked up at james who was leaning over her and said i love you too james leaned back down and kissed her and they both laid there feeling the rain pouring down on them they went outside and walked over to two chairs james took his wand out and dried them off the air was heavy from the previous rain but fortunately the sky was clear james gestured for lily to take a seat and she did okay wait right here i ll be right back james said where are you going lily asked relax love james said it is a birthday surprise and it wouldntbe a surprise if i told you now would it lily smiled and nodded good then well like i said wait here i ll be right back james said james ran off with his box and opened it far out in his yard lumos he said and then searched through his box until he found what he was looking for aha james then set it down in the grass and ran back over to where lily was waiting he sat down next to her and smiled ready he asked lily eyed him suspiciously and then nodded right then james said he then sent out three bursts of light which looked like fire into his backyard look up lily looked up and then saw three huge bursts in the air which caused her eyes to widen james had set up fireworks to shoot in the air and then after they exploded they would spell out words the first three words spelled happy birthday lily lily looked at james awestruck he just grinned back there was something ingenious about these fireworks though the marauders wouldnthave it any other way when they exploded and spelled out words they would not fade away like fireworks usually would these fireworks would instead transform to look like the stars consequently making it look like these messages were written in the stars james then set out three more sparks from his wand lily looked eagerly at the sky and waited to see what these explosions would spell out i love you lily turned to james and smiled james again grinned back lily leaned her head on james shoulder and looked up into the sky watching the words transform into stars james put his arm around her and kissed the top of her head now just one more thing to finish it off james said he then sent two more sparks out to the yard and then the sky lit up once more it read love james lily smiled up at the sky happy birthday lils james said thanks lily said james smiled lily i have loved you since the moment i laid eyes on you ever since our first kiss every day of my life has been nothing but happiness every moment i with you is bliss james got down on his knee and took lily left hand lily eyes widened realizing what james was doing will you marry me breathe lily took a deep breath smiled and then nodded yes she

lily was too shocked and happy to take everything in but she had heard and said the important part and that all that matters come then you to lets see a little celebrating sirius said happy to see his

skates i ll meet you at the lake lily gave james another hug thanks again she said and then ran off james just stood there and watched her leave you did something involving lily right for once james thought james went up to the gryffindor common room and grabbed sirius ice skates and then went down to the lake and saw lily out on the ice skating backwards looks like you remembered how to skate james yelled as he was walking to the lake lily stopped skating for a minute and realized that it was james talking to her a little lily said you are going backwards i think that counts as remembering james said lily laughed yeah but i used to be able to do jumps and spins and all of that stuff lily said well dontworry you will remember james said he tied sirius skates on and walked over to the ice hesitated for a minute and then stepped onto the ice he stayed upright at first once he tried moving he didntdo so well as he was attempting to move forward he started losing his balance and lily rushed over and grabbed his hands before he fell thanks james said laughing haha no problem okay now try like this lily said she held his hands and skated backwards so she could help him skate forwards after a while of that james was beginning to grasp the concept see you re getting it lily said soon james could skate without holing onto lily yeah a bit now lets see the amazing miss lily show me what she used to be able to do james said uh i dontknow i haventdone it in such a long time lily said dontworry i sure you can do it james said he went over to the edge of the lake and sat down in the snow on the lake edge so he could watch her promise you wontlaugh lily asked promise james said lily then skated over to the middle of the lake she took a deep breath and then started skating in big circles crossing her right foot over her left as she skated she then went into a pivot around her left foot slowly brought her right foot closer in crossed her arms and spun around fast in a circle she eventually put her toe picks in to the ice to stop well i didntfall lily said are you kidding me james asked that was bloody brilliant i can hardly stand and there you go doing all those spin y cross y things lily laughed do another james said fine fine and then lily went off and did a big spin and went into a jump and landed perfectly james just looked at her in awe what lily asked wow how can you do that you were in the air james said lots of practice lily explained i think you have taken a long enough break why dontyou come and try again i guess james said standing up but i still might need a little help james said standing up looking almost afraid to move lily laughed and skated over to him she held his hands and skated backwards helping him skated forwards just like before how bout you do another one of those spins miss lily james said uh fine here how about this lily said holding one of his hands up here now keep your hand here and hold on to my hand and then ill spin like a ballerina lily said laughing haha okay james said holding lily hands up lily spun around like a ballerina laughing as she saw james smiling when she twirled lily stopped twirling stood on her toe picks and put her arms around james neck why thank you kind sir she said my pleasure madame james said lily still stood there tiptoed on her skates her arms around james neck she just stood like that with a grin on and then james started to lean in but just then lily lost balance on her skates from being on the picks and slipped falling on top of james lily burst out laughing hahahahahah oh my gosh i so sorry are you okay lily asked haha yeah i okay james said lily stood up and then helped james up i think that enough ice skating for me for one day lily said yeah james said it starting to get dark anyway they headed back to the castle carrying their skates thanks lily said for what james asked for convincing me to go skating again it was loads of fun lily said no problem i had fun too james said lily smiled up at him and then they reached the heads room i gonna go change and then head down for dinner lily said okay i ll meet you there i dontneed to change james said kay see you soon lily said and when into her room to get changed james walked out of the heads common room and out into the hall damn james said and kicked the wall why is it that when i always go for it something goes wrong james said aloud to himself because you have to wait until she is ready she may want to but she may not be ready wait until she is ready james nearly jumped out of his socks he looked around and no one was there it was the angel statue leading to the heads room that spoke him bloody hell you scared the living daylights out of me james said sorry dear just

james said his parents had been friends with the minister of magic for quite some time so he was obviously at the party of their son engagement can you apparate james asked the minister tried but there was no avail they ve blocked the system someone shouted there was a knock on the back door and everyone turned mind if we join the party a death eater said from outside and then blew the door down everyone grabbed their wands as the death eaters started coming in followed by voldemort himself everyone immediately began shooting spells across the room where the minister james whispered to sirius as they were battling back to back with the death eaters he gone upstairs through the library sirius whispered back we should check if the floo duck both james and sirius ducked causing their opponents to hit each other knocking them out we should check the floo powder sirius finished both taking on new opponents where lily james asked panicked james then saw lily hit by a spell and was being lifted into the air seemingly choking i ve got it mate go sirius shouted and james ran over to lily well isntit the famous mudblood dumbledore holds you highly you filthy creature let see how

the battle continued on as lily ran for the dining room she had to dodge a few curses but managed to get to the dining room in one piece lily searched rapidly for the floo powder and found it on the mantle above the fireplace merlin please have this work lily said to herself and stepped in the fireplace ministry of magic she yelled and threw down a handful of floo powder soon she was surrounded by green flames lily tumbled out of the fireplace and into the ministry headquarters the security around the fireplace had their wands pointed towards her for safety but she just shouted out there another attack at the potters we need the aurors oh you pathetic blood traitor voldemort said slamming james into a wall why keep this up it will just be faster to let me kill you voldemort said thrusting another killing curse at james which he deflected though he was getting weak voldemort was about to send another killing curse at james when sirius came running over and deflected it he was about to send a stun spell at voldemort but voldemort acted quicker and sirius was soon up in the air as lily had been before ah black another blood traitor your brother is one of my favorites too bad you couldnthave joined us but the offer is still open i d rather die sirius spit out well if you insist not a moment too soon the aurors came bursting in the doors immediately going after the death eaters and leading their group was dumbledore heading straight towards voldemort before he knew it sirius was back on the ground and dumbledore and voldemort were battling in front of everyone oh tom

month walking down the isle in this stunning gown i think it is yay a new chapter well i hope you guys like it please please review i ll update asap thanks so much disclaimer i dontown anything yada yada yada summary james has always been in love with lily and lily has always though that james was a bigheaded toe rag it is there last year at hogwarts and james knows that it is now or never to finally get lily james even has the advantage of being head boy and lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 63 strike two everyone sat gathered around a large table at one of the many order of the phoenix meetings dumbledore was explaining how many muggle towns were being attacked by death eaters and how the ministry was working very hard to prevent this but it was time to take matters into their own hands many of the order members were also in auror training so almost everyone was wiped out lily sat there paying close attention to everything dumbledore was saying while james sat there next to her leaning on the table with one arm his other hand was holding hers and fiddling with her engagement ring letting his mind wander it was mid april their wedding was just a few days away suddenly alastor moody came into the room he was surprisingly absent from the days meeting and it was soon realized why moody went up to dumbledore his magic eye wandering and whispered something hoarsely to him dumbledore expression turned slightly alarmed but he tried not to show it alright everyone there is an attack taking place at this very moment he then told them of the location alarming lily being as it was very close to her parents house everyone was quickly sorted into groups and they immediately apparated to the town james and lily were partnered with frank and alice remus and kendall were partnered with sirius and alyssa peter who was squirming uncomfortably in his chair the whole time groups were being sorted was in group with moody and some other professional aurors the groups set out to their appointed areas the exact location currently being uncertain james and lily sat crouched behind a patch of bushes frank and alice in a patch across from them ug no one is even here lily whispered it better to be prepared james whispered back i know lily sighed james was once again holding lily hand and fiddling with her engagement ring james why do you keep doing that lily asked because i like to he said it reminds me that i not dreaming and this is really happening we are really getting married lily smiled and leaned her head on james shoulder i ve only dreamed of this since i was well since i first saw you and now it reality lily laughed to herself and was about to respond when a sound caused them to immediately be on alert again it was alice screaming surprise surprise one of the many newly approached death eaters said while alice was suspended in mid air in pain frank looked murderous literally and he was going on a rampage taking out as many death eaters as he could getting to the one with the hold on alice james and lily jumped into action and started fighting off the death eaters they managed to take control of the death eaters frank was fighting while frank managed to attack the death eater cursing alice alice dropped to the ground and seemed to be unconscious but not dead the three of them were doing a pretty good job fighting the death eaters and they had them at an advantage alice began to regain consciousness and it seemed like this would be an easy victory for james lily and frank that was until the three death eaters left that they were fighting suddenly bowed down on their knees and put their heads down this greatly confused them as they slightly lowered their wands it wasntuntil lily was suddenly uplifted into the air that they realized that there was someone behind them all the color in james face was drained when he turned around to see the wand holding lily in the air was held by a figure with piercing red eyes and so we meet again mudblood voldemort said james immediately sent a spell hurling towards him which he just as quickly deflected the death eaters behind them started to rise again and were about to start sending curses towards james and frank because their backs were turned they didntsee this coming but luckily alice spotted them watch out james and frank turned around not getting hit directly by the curses sent to them but being blast away further from voldemort and lily alice quickly apparated to go get help and james was over his head in emotion he had to get to lily but if he went to save her he could be hit from behind and risk frank how long until voldemort tried to kill her james then suddenly got a strength in him knowing that he would never let lily get hurt like that then in one swift move he took out one of the death eaters and hit voldemort with a spell the spell wasntas affective as he had hoped but he successfully managed to release voldemort grip on lily lily gasped for breath having been in a choke hold and tried as quickly as she could to get to her feet it seems you fools are always getting in my way of killing muggles voldemort said as he sent the illegal curses repetitively towards them luckily due to excessive training all of them were dodged after a while of this james and lily were getting very tired they tried blocking as much as they could but some of the spells they couldntblock just as voldemort stared to yell crucio there was a sudden crack preventing him from finishing the curse ah tom so we meet again dumbledore said voldemort eye flashed a bright shade of scarlet and he sent a curse spiraling towards dumbledore to which he deflected with a wave of a hand a few more cracks were heard and sirius remus alyssa and kendall appeared voldemort his death eaters currently defeated decided it was best to save this for another time in a flash he was gone alice ran over to frank and everyone else rushed over to lily and james who were not currently in a good state after a quick trip to st mungos for some minor injuries everyone returned to the potter estate they were all sitting in one of the many living rooms talking like it was old times frank and alice had to leave early because they were getting the final papers on their new flat then it was just the old gang left lily james sirius alyssa remus kendall and peter do you remember when prongsie here tried to flush lilian book down the toilet haha you got so mad i recall you coming into the boys lavatory and shoving his head in the toilet sirius said laughing lily and james both blushed and laughed along with the rest of the group well i seem to recall another time that year when james cast a sticking charm on the toilet remus said trying not to laugh and failing miserably lily was stuck there for quite a while sirius added even lily laughed at this one remembering all of the things james used to do to her and she was getting married to him now what was it with you guys and bathroom pranks peter asked this sent the boys in another fit of laughter peter grinning widely having made his friends laugh james then sat up come on mates marauder meeting in the kitchen the three boys grinned mischievously at each other and followed james into the kitchen oh dear what could they possibly be doing now kendall asked merlin only knows alyssa said but i never heard about that bathroom story lily her grin getting wider i had to tell mcgonagall that i was in the hospital wing i came into class and they were all laughing at me because they knew why i was really late lily said defending herself it not something i wanted to share with the world alyssa and kendall started laughing well i remember when james huddled everyone in a circle in the kitchen and said so marauders i say that we play a final prank before i go off and tie the knot now here what we do lily kendall and alyssa were all laughing when they heard james voice ladies care to come out here for a surprise james asked god this cantbe good lily said okay when they come out that bucket of sticky goo will pour all over them and they ll fall and get stuck to the floor james whispered then we can do with them what we please sirius said rubbing his hands together james and remus looked at him first in disgust and then pondered what he just said oh except you mate sorry sirius said patting peter on the back that o okay peter said i ve g got to go to the b bathroom anyways he started passing the open doorway to the hall with the bathroom until james pulled him back that the trigger mate go through the library there a bathroom in the hall over there james said t thanks prongs peter said rushing off in the other

doorway goo was spilled all over them and they slipped and fell to the floor james potter lily yelled trying to get up and not succeeding sorry love had to pull one last prank before we re married he said the three girls laughed i suppose you did lily said and then thinking of an idea that kendall and alyssa seemed to pick up on well at least help us up james smiled and bent over to help lily up

lily being head girl well we all know that he gets her in the end but here is how he did it chapter 64 the big day lily stood in front of the triple mirror in her parents room she took a deep breath and flattened out her dress are you sure it not too much lily asked her last minute nerves coming on full force oh dear you look lovely her mother assured her this is the most gorgeous dress i have ever seen your mum right lily kendall said it is absolutely spectacular plus it not as if you can change your mind now lily bit her lip and turned at different angles in the mirror kendall alyssa and alice stood to the side of lily hoping that she wouldntget cold feet seeing how nervous she looked lily then took a deep breath and pictured herself walking down the isle seeing james and his gorgeous smile at the end of it immediately her nerves were calmed but her heart started beating even faster at that thought alright she said i ready james stood in front of his mirror in his room adjusting his bowtie for what seemed like the thousandth time will you stop fooling around with your bloody tie sirius said leaning back on two legs on james desk chair i just want to make sure it straight james assured him that what you said the last time he told you to stop fooling with it remus said with a grin on g guys peter said coming out of james bathroom i cantquite get it the fellow marauders looked at their hopeless friend in a very twisted excuse for a tuxedo dontworry mate i ll help you remus said walking over to peter taking out his wand on the way good luck sirius said under his breath but just then sirius put a little too much weight back on the chair and he fell completely backwards and out of the chair onto the floor everyone turned to him with blank stares on their faces sirius quickly stood up brushed himself off and then folded his arms across his chest looking up at the ceiling nothing happened he said the others slowly turned away and back to what they were doing sirius picked up the chair quickly and then shifted around uncomfortably next to it a split second later everyone just burst out laughing lily carefully walked down the stairs with the help of her mother and four bridesmaids once she was downstairs her mother began taking many pictures and everyone else joined in tears of joy flowed down her mothers face and her father tried to hold them in as much as he could well lily breathed deeply i guess it now or never with that she took one step closer to the stunning white limo waiting outside james straightened his bowtie and looked in the mirror for one last time alright mates i ready james said instead of making some wisecrack remark sirius walked up to james and put his hand on his shoulder well mate so much for our late night partying with a million chicks he said but i really couldntbe happier for you lily is amazing and i sure you know that more then any of us remus then walked over on james other side he right mate this is only what you ve dreamed of since you first met lily and here you are y yeah i i really happy for you too prongs peter stuttered thanks guys james said and we ll still always be the marauders the most amazing pranksters that hogwarts has ever seen just because i getting married doesntmean that everything is going to change well of course it will change but james suddenly got a whole wave of feeling wash over him as he had just casually used the phrase getting married we know prongs sirius said once a marauder always a marauder now let maybe be on time for something once in our lives remus said brightening up the mood nah sirius said no need to be on time it only prongsies wedding why should that make it any difference sirius joked the four of them then walked out of james room to take a few pictures with james parents and then off to the wedding lily sat nervously in the limo slowly nearing their destination james and the rest of his party had just apparated to the church james stood nervously at the altar watching people start to arrive he saw many of his family members and what he assumed were lily family members start to arrive he was very surprised when a certain white bearded someone in majestic purple robes walked up to him professor dumbledore james asked in disbelief dumbledore laughed and shook james hand you didntthink that we would miss this special day of your would you he asked well i thought that you d be too busy we ah dumbledore then gestured back to professors mcgonagall and flitwick at the back of the church they couldntbare to miss this special day either after chatting with dumbledore for a moment he returned to his seat and james was once again overtaken with nervous feelings what if she doesnt show up what if she decides that she really doesntwant to get married what would i do oh merlin what would i do as always sirius came to james at the most imperfect time with a serious look on his face james i have something to tell you he said dontyou dare tell me you re in love with lily james said well actually i have to go to the bathroom james actually thought about punching him dontyou bloody scare me like that ever again he said the wedding is going to start in a few minutes anyways i ll make it quick sirius said hurrying away i promise he yelled behind him as he hurried off to find the bathroom kendall alyssa and alice entered the church to go get their flowers and such that they would be carrying lily walked slowly into the church still a bundle of nerves her mother handed lily her flowers kissed her on the cheek and left to find her seat sirius ran back into the church and quickly found his place again next to james see mate i early just then the music started right on time right on time i mean james couldntget worked up over his best friends he was too worried that lily wouldntshow up at all just then james saw lily bridesmaids start to come down the isle his heart started beating faster and faster lily took many deep breaths and linked her arm through her dad arm she set her first footstep on the isle james could hear his heartbeat loud in his ear even through the noise and music and flashing cameras around him just then he saw lily walk onto the isle his mouth actually fell open i am marrying the most beautiful woman in the entire world at that moment seeing lily in her amazingly gorgeous gown his frazzled nerves seemed to calm down and he couldnthelp but smile lily saw james standing at the end of the isle and her heart nearly exploded she saw his smile turn into the most gorgeous grin she had ever seen and her knees became weak but she kept going smiling big out of nervous habit james reached his hand back to mess up his hair he tried so hard but couldnthelp it lily was almost at the end of the isle and when she finally got there her father gave her hand away to james the moment lily hand was in his there was a spark and their eyes immediately locked their grins mimicked each others

walked outside into the garden and found james sitting on one of the benches his head leaned back looking up at the stars lily came over and sat down next to him he continued to look up at the stars lily then leaned her head back and looked up too she then noticed a cloud coming in starting to cover up the stars they sat like this for the longest time neither one saying a word to each other they stared up at the sky until the stars were all covered over by a dark cloud almost everyone had left the ball by then and there they sat lily then felt a raindrop on her nose she wrinkled her nose making sure that she was right she was then a couple more started to fall james finally looked away from the sky i guess we should probably go in everyone is gone and its starting to rain james said
