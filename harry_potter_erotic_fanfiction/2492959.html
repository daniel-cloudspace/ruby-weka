 disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter one new beginnings the unexpected death of albus dumbledore had gripped the wizarding world in a way that seemed almost unfathomable to hermione granger she had never not even in her wildest fantasies of magical beings witches and wizards dating back to when she was but a mere child seen so many extraordinary things and moreover people all gathered together it was the type of event that should be brought about by happy times perhaps the permanent defeat of voldemort it should not have been the honoring the burial of the greatest wizard to ever live who could protect everyone specifically harry from lord voldemort dumbledore was the only one that he ever feared and now he was gone and not just on a mysterious leave of absence that caused excited whispers to make their way along the corridors and throughout the great hall when teachers werentaround he wasntcoming back albus dumbledore had been murdered hit with the avada kedavra curse no less if that wasntenough to make hermione utter a gut wrenching sob and wish that this madness would just end snape had been the one to utter that fatal spell severus snape the one whom professor dumbledore trusted completely snape the professor who had been gunning to teach defense against the dark arts for longer than hermione had been alive the one who had been branded with the dark mark he was the greasy man who not only hated james and sirius but contributed greatly to both of their deaths the man who had been inside the headquarters for the order of the phoenix the man who had been entrusted with the daunting task of teaching harry occlumency was a traitor he worshipped the dark lord hermione was no doubt a clever witch how could she not recognize the signs why didntshe listen to harry hadnthe said from day one that malfoy was planning something and that snape was likely involved and assisting him but no hermione wouldntlisten she was too busy with important things to deal with harry and his ramblings she was too far up on her high horse after being correct about the department of mysteries to even consider that she wasntright this time around the bigger they are the harder they fall and hermione ego was as big as they came she knew she mustntblame herself that it wasnt her fault that dumbledore was dead or that malfoy and snape had gotten away she wasntresponsible for anything but that didntkeep the thoughts from creeping into her head the half blood prince why didntshe figure it out sooner she correctly brewed a polyjuice potion in her second year at hogwarts she helped get past that three headed dog she solved the mystery of the basilisk she got an o on all but one owl this should have been easy for her and now hogwarts was closing perhaps forever harry was going off to find the remaining horcruxes ginny was nursing a slightly broken heart and bill was nursing wounds from a werewolf there was nothing she could do about it draco malfoy was out there somewhere considering himself voldemort most faithful follower or was he being punished for not being able to kill dumbledore himself was he being tormented was he feeling voldemort wrath because snape had to do the killing curse for him she prayed that wherever malfoy was he was being tortured until the welcome release of death was upon him the trip home which happened much earlier and under much darker pretenses than anyone had expected when they made the journey in september was unusually quiet the compartment holding ginny harry ron hermione neville and luna was not filled with the usual sounds of laughter and swapping of treats so much as it was filled with a deafening silence the occasional sniff and the low croaking of trevor neville toad they had loads to say to each other most importantly goodbye but everyone refused to be the first to speak they were all hesitant to break the silence and ginny found herself praying that she would get an invitation to join the slug club for a farewell cup of tea she did not want to be there she didntwant to deal with luna absentmindedly twiddling her thumbs because she didnthave the heart to pull out her issue of the quibbler which was no doubt already full of crazy stories about how dumbledore was killed by a crumple horned snorkack she didntthink she could put up with much from neville either her patience was wearing thin and even dear sweet neville was eligible to receive a bat bogey hex if he wasntcareful she might ve done it by now if hermione hadntcast a silencing spell on his stupid toad mere seconds before she pulled out her own wand hermione while earning points for putting an end to the incessant croaking had been driving her absolutely mad she hadntdragged ron off to do prefect rounds for obvious reasons and it was killing her slowly enforcing rules was hermione favourite pastime apart from reading hogwarts a history and she couldntdo either at that present moment if any of them had been conversing she would ve begged hermione to just whip out her book and stop shifting in her bloody seat ron was staring blankly into space but that was to be expected he was obviously bored out of his mind and was most likely daydreaming about snogging or something disgusting like that his stomach gave a loud grumble effectively cutting through the silence of the room and ginny decided that perhaps her brother was wondering whether or not the food trolley would come by instead of that slag lavender brown nonetheless she didntwant to be around him at the moment she most certainly did not want to sit beside one harry potter who would no doubt be spending the majority of his summer at the burrow with her presuming he didntstart his heroic vanquish he who must not be named flight just yet he had just however unintentionally it had been broken her heart she knew he had every reason in the world to not be with her and that he was being brave and noble and she should be thankful that someone of his caliber even looked at her she was poor and had big yucky freckles all over her skin he was famous and unless some miracle occurred most likely going to suffer the same fate as countless great wizards professor dumbledore included before him but no matter what their futures held she desperately wanted him to want her to tell her that he was crazy when he broke up with her and that he needed to be with her ginny was about to get up and visit dean hoping his compartment would be a little more lively when she resurveyed her surroundings her brother was now staring absolutely love struck at hermione she looked his way and caught his eye rousing a smile from his otherwise sullen face and causing his ears to glow bright red in the process ron casually stretched and inched his way closer to the busy haired girl while hermione shifted to get comfortable successfully sliding about a foot closer to ginny git of a brother could they be any more horrendously obvious luna had finally given in and pulled out a copy of the quibbler which she flipped through rather violently before stopped on a specific page and turning it upside down neville yawned causing his grip to loosen to trevor who sprang free and had to be cornered by harry neville and ron before he could be caught again looking unhappy as ever as he moved his mouth soundlessly ginny then threw a quick glance at harry who returned the glance and offered her a small uncertain smile she smiled back though she didntfeel like it and briefly wondered whether she would ever be able to genuinely smile laugh or jump for joy ever again harry put an arm around her pulling her closer to him and she smiled once again it was still uncomfortable and foreign on her face like her skin was pulled far too tight to accommodate the smile creeping its way across her visage but not as severely as it had previously felt looking around at her friends she couldnthelp but feel her heart lift slightly luna had slowly drifted off to asleep her head on neville shoulder and her magazine face down in her lap neville had a faraway look in his eyes but a tinge of colour creeping to his cheeks most likely due to his contact with luna hermione and ron shoulders were now touching though they acted as if they hadntmoved even an inch from their previous spots harry the boy who had broken up with her not three hours before had his arm idly draped over her his thumb running small circles on her shoulder they were an odd bunch she wouldntdeny it but she didntcare to ginny weasley there was no place in which she could possibly find better company than where she currently was nobody uttered another sound until they were about twenty minutes from their destination of king cross d you reckon this ll be our last time coming home from hogwarts harry had not considered it truly considered it until ron spoke up d you reckon this ll be our last time coming home from hogwarts sure he had thought about no longer having to deal with classes and homework and filch but he never fully comprehended what he was losing harry would no longer get to play and watch the quidditch games no more seeing dobby the house elf he would never again walk through platform nine and three quarters or hear hagrid calling firs years over ere there would be no sorting hat ceremony no amazing feasts or late night runs to the kitchen under the protection of his invisibility cloak the marauder map would be of no use to him no hogsmeade weekends no secret da meetings no parties in the common room he would miss it he would miss the cold air that snuck in through the castle walls the fat lady outside gryffindor common room the staircases that moved on their own accord he would miss visiting hagrid hut and the crazy dangerous trips to the forbidden forest ones that he took more often than he should have being that it was forbidden he was leaving behind beloved teachers and friends many of whom he may never see again many of whom might not survive the summer it was all too much for harry to deal with having just sat through dumbledore funeral of course that wasntall he had done he had ended things with ginny and unwittingly vowed that he ron and hermione would track down the horcruxes together what was he thinking he may have just agreed to lead his best mates to their deaths and even if they did survive there was no doubt in harry mind that they would follow him all the way to the final battle in which he and he alone could defeat voldemort how many lives would be lost ron and hermione had sacrificed themselves for him countless times in the past and had made it no secret that they would do it again harry come on for all we know you re probably the one who can defeat you know who i can t hermione cant i bet even dumbledore can t it up to you and if i need to to you know then i will ron had said after the battle at the department of mysteries when they were alone in the hospital wing he couldntexpress to ron how touched he was at that moment harry had told him that it was unnecessary and that it would never come to that ron had just shrugged and after seeing the look of fierce loyalty and determination in his eyes harry vowed to himself that he would never let voldemort anywhere near ron or hermione from that moment on he intended to keep that vow which meant he had to find a way to keep them from being present in the final battle he would stun them throw his cloak over them and hide then under a bed at the burrow if he absolutely had to there was a pattern for people who wanted to help him they ended up dead it happened to everyone he has ever loved because voldemort knew how he felt for them he knew and he killed them so he could weaken harry but harry was through with being weak he wouldntlet voldemort kill anther person that he loved voldemort had already taken too many and now it was time for him to pay dunno ginny mumbled from beside him i hope not you lot might be okay to leave hogwarts but i haventeven finished all of my owls yet it ll feel too weird there without dumbledore said neville coming out of his reverie yes but we mustnt quit school dumbledore wouldnthave wanted that hermione enforced yes but we might not have a choice hermione argued ron a silence fell over the compartment and its six members as they considered this harry looked at ron and hermione who had moved apart slightly neville luna who had stirred moments before ron spoke and ginny the girl in his arms they were his friends each a piece of the puzzle ron and hermione his very first friends ever without them he would have been dead in the first year neville the boy could have been in his shoes if only voldemort had picked frank and alice longbottom instead of james and lily potter luna the girl whose sanity was questionable yet could see the thestrals and hear the voices behind the veil just as he could and ginny the only person who made him feel utterly happy and completely understood no matter what crazy thing was happening around or inside of him it only seemed fitting that if this truly was their last ride he spent it with them they or at least he ron hermione and neville spent their very first one together it was a nice way to bookend their hogwarts experience it felt like just yesterday they were anxiously making their way to their new school and now six short years later they were leaving harry heart would ache for hogwarts and the fact that he couldntreturn but knew that he wouldn t even if everyone else did he had a job to do he owed it to dumbledore the train slowed and gradually came to a halt they looked around at each other wishing that they didnthave to get up and go their separate ways harry hugged each of them even ron and ginny who he would no doubt be seeing within a few weeks after exchanging hugs and promises to write to each other something they ve never done before they collected their things and got off the train and then for the very last time in his life harry potter went home to number four privet drive as ronald weasley watched his best mate stalk off with those muggles moments before getting on the train harry had told ron and hermione that he really should go back there alone and they reluctantly agreed he sighed and then turned to his mother his father was off talking to hermione parents looking absolutely thrilled and fascinated they hugged hello even though he had seen his mum at dumbledore funeral just hours ago mr weasley followed by the grangers came over with a smile across his tired freckled face good news good news hermione will be coming directly to the burrow to stay for a little while arthur said mum doesntthink i safe at home since they dontknow magic you know i told them that i can do magic now without getting in trouble but they still think you can protect me better than they or i could explained hermione i hope i not putting you out mrs weasley ron mum beamed and said something about how it was no trouble at all but ron wasntreally listening hermione of all people didntneed protection she was the most capable witch his age maybe even more capable than some of the older ones too but if her parents thought she needed protecting ron would be the one to protect her not harry not vicky who was off in bulgaria somewhere he ron would keep her safe when they got to the burrow ron tried to convince his mum that although he hadnt technically passed his test he could still apparate there but she wouldntallow it the grangers stayed for dinner all the weasley members excluding percy of course tonks lupin fleur hermione and her parents had a big feast in the backyard ginny seemed uncharacteristically quiet but only ron seemed to notice he caught her eye and smiled but she only nodded in return was it harry he d kill harry best mate or not if he had hurt his baby sister or maybe she was just upset over dumbledore after dinner the twins tried to organize a game of quidditch the grangers much to ron amusement looked rather scared when fred and george brought out the beaters bats but said nothing ginny still in her weird mood looked around and said y know i dontthink i feel much like playing perhaps i ll just go up to bed as she scurried off into the house ron and hermione exchanged looks after much prodding from her ron ran inside after his sister he climbed up the sets of stairs and stopped outside her bedroom door he knocked but she didntanswer gin gin it me ron can i come in ron asked when she still didntanswer he turned the handle and went inside he found ginny his only sister the girl who was so vibrant and full of life in a ball on her bed crying so hard that she was shaking he had never particularly been there for ginny even when she was little she could hold her own so he never had to protect her from fred and george when she started off at hogwarts she seemed to have a lot of friends so he didnthang out with her much he always thought that maybe if he had been there she wouldnthave needed that bloody diary and she wouldnthave been pulled into the chamber of secrets after that he spent more time with her she participated in da meetings and joined the quidditch team she followed the others to the department of mysteries where much to his mix of pride and embarrassment she fought much better than he did against the death eaters he didntprotect her there she was the one who protected him she stunned anyone who tried to hurt him while he wrestled helplessly with the brains and stayed with him while he healed in the hospital wing it was his time to finally for once just be her older brother it was time to love her and give her a shoulder to cry on because she definitely needed one without another word he walked over to her wrapped his arms around her and they stayed that like until hermione came in a few hours later ready for bed the return to the dursley house was bitter sweet for harry he couldnthave been happier to know that he was officially free to leave forever after this short visit but he was also uneasy because he knew that he was no longer protected from voldemort in doing so he talked to ron often sending messages through hedwig and pig every letter contained information about dementors and what was happening in the wizarding community although harry had read it all in the daily prophet harry was dying to know about the order and what they were doing but he knew he couldntask incase the letters were intercepted finally after nearly two uneventful but not completely miserable weeks at the dursley s he owled ron and told him that he was ready to go to the burrow arthur weasley sent an owl saying he would pick him up the following day at six in the evening harry hastily packed everything he owned on the next morning a beautiful sunny wednesday this was the day he would leave the dursley house this was the last time he would see his aunt uncle and cousin ever again this was the day he had been waiting for since he arrived on their doorstep sixteen years ago at half past five he brought his trunk and hedwig cage downstairs into the living room he made sure everything he owned was in it since he would never be coming back to retrieve any forgotten items so said uncle vernon is that er dumbuldey man coming to get you again at the mention of dumbledore harry felt his chest tighten uncomfortably he was so caught off guard that he didnteven have time to enjoy his uncle shifty eyes and uneasy expression dumbledore no harry whispered he he dead aunt petunia now emerged from the kitchen clearly having heard the exchange looking nervous what do you mean dead she asked i mean said harry irritably that he died and it therefore impossible for him to come back but what will happen now asked aunt petunia her voice quivering harry had never not once seen her look so afraid did she perhaps understand how powerful dumbledore had been and how bleak things looked now that he gone petunia dear what do we care what happens to their lot uncle vernon asked airily waving a dismissive hand at his nephew because vernon this has a lot to do with us as well haventyou noticed strange happenings going on this past year aunt petunia sounded desperate now the fog all the murders and that bridge collapsing last year she turned her attention back to harry harry had only once before heard her talk about the wizarding world with actual concern and a little bit of knowledge it was two years ago when he and dudley had been attacked by dementors it okay i taking care of it said harry what do you mean you re taking care of it boy the one causing all this trouble voldemort i the only one who can defeat him dumbledore and i had a mission before he died and now it up to me to complete it he explained her eyes went wide you you have to do it you have to kill him could that be fear in her voice or was harry just mistaken he was the one who who killed her yep he said curtly slightly bothered by the fact that his aunt couldnteven bring herself to say her sister name aunt petunia strolled over to the couch and sat down beside uncle vernon by the look on her face she wanted to know more but you ll be killed she exclaimed was that apprehension harry heard you never know i ve fought him before harry explained aunt petunia looked positively dumbstruck a bunch of times actually nearly every year since i started attending hogwarts harry knew he had her undivided attention when she didntcringe and tell him to keep his voice down when talking about that crackpot school of his uncle vernon was absentmindedly staring at the tv though harry was sure he was taking in every word of the conversation but you had that dumbldore fellow back then didntyou asked aunt petunia harry shrugged well sometimes not the first year when voldemort possessed one of my teachers and tried to have him kill me not in my second year when a basilisk it a giant snake bit me and tried to murder both me and my er my friend sister harry said and not fourth year either when i was transported to a graveyard and had to duel voldemort after he murdered one of my friends he continued she looked as if she might be sick just hearing about the things her nephew had faced good harry thought now maybe she ll understand that there are things out there that are more important than her garden and the bloody neighbours then there was fifth year that was when my godfather died and dumbledore didntshow up to that fight until it was almost over and even when he was there voldemort still managed to possess me for a bit oh and five of my friends almost died that time too then this year a bunch of voldemort supporters broke into my school and almost killed them all again you you ve done all that whispered aunt petunia all that has happened to to you harry nodded and shrugged yep he mumbled the room fell silent for several moments the only sound that could be heard was coming from the tv which had been turned down considerably since the start of the discussion and now you re going to fight this vomeldort thing again voldemort harry corrected and yeah i am but not right now first i going to my friend ron house for a little vacation but since hogwarts ll probably close down i donthave any school to worry about he explained and after i finish collecting everything i looking for i going to hunt him down and end this once and for all any colour left in her face previous to that last sentence drained away as aunt petunia gaped at harry uncle vernon must have forgotten that he was pretending to be deeply immersed in his tv programme because his head snapped over in harry direction aunt petunia stood up and took a step toward him and harry noticed that her hands were shaking slightly your mother she she would be proud whispered aunt petunia i like to think so replied harry with a soft smile he and his aunt he and any member of this family had never had a proper conversation in his life they had never expressed any emotions toward harry unless you count blinding anger and they had certainly never spoken about his mother in a nice way aunt petunia eyes swept over harry who was now taller than her and her chin quivered was she crying over him was she crying because she had only now realized it was his destiny to kill voldemort or perhaps she was crying over her sister the one she had only pretended to hate there was a loud crack and arthur weasley appeared in the dursley living room a foot away from harry uncle vernon gave a small start but aunt petunia remained unfazed she was still gazing at harry hello all so sorry to barge in like this harry son are you all set mr weasley asked harry nodded not taking his eyes off of his aunt mr weasley looked around examining the muggle settings but said nothing he had learned over the years that the dursley werentthe most accepting of the wizarding world and it was best not to rile them up uncle vernon arose from his place on the couch and stumbled over to where harry and aunt petunia stood he reached his hand out waiting for harry to shake it well goodbye then you er take care of yourself harry he said slowly harry looked at his uncle and considered the strange look in his eyes every time harry imaged this scenario in his mind his uncle was dancing around the room absolutely giddy that harry would be gone he wouldntcare what happened to harry as long as his bothersome nephew was out of his hair but now uncle vernon seemed to care or at the very least seemed to realize the enormity of everything harry had before him he looked genuinely something and it wasntjust because mr weasley was standing there holding a wand he clapped harry on the back and backed away dudley chose that moment to enter the living room giving a small yelp of fright upon seeing mr weasley he looked at harry and said so you re going then harry nodded oh he gave a small movement that looked similar to a slight wave and harry returned it wordlessly aunt petunia stepped a little closer to where harry was standing and in a move harry never would have expected she half hugged him be safe she whispered when she pulled away harry looked at his uncle and was shocked to see that he didntlook absolutely outraged that his wife was showing affection for harry he felt a funny strange sensation in his chest was he going to miss them he didntthink it was possible after every rotten thing they had ever done but somewhere deep inside during this conversation with his aunt petunia he developed a tiny fondness for her or at the very least he loathed her a little bit less harry turned to mr weasley and picked up hedwig cage how re we getting to the burrow mr weasley we re flooing there you cantapparate yet right asked mr weasley right i wasntof age so i couldntgo when ron and hermione took it harry explained very well then said mr weasley have you said your goodbyes harry nodded an hour ago the thought of saying goodbye to the dursleys was laughable he had planned on slipping away without uttering a single parting word with them but now as ron father grabbed his trunk and ushered him into the fireplace he threw one final glance at them he nodded at his uncle vernon the short round man whose face wasntas purple today as it normally was his eyes momentarily came to rest on dudley his childhood bully who was as large as ever then he caught sight of aunt petunia his only remaining connection to his mother she was his last surviving relative the one who took him in all those years ago had he ever said thank you of course he hadn t he couldntstand any of them up until ten minutes ago perhaps it because he was on slightly better terms with them now but harry finally realized all that they d done for him while they never bought him anything new or even so much as smiled at him in the past they had given him a place to live some food to eat and clothes to wear and while none of these things were exactly wonderful they had kept him alive thanks he mumbled he was about to repeat it slightly louder when he saw aunt petunia nod slightly in recognition she smiled at him and mere seconds before mr weasley yelled the burrow and they were spinning around in the flames harry could have sworn he saw a tear run down his aunt cheek the welcome wagon for harry when he arrived at the burrow was the usual clan on weasley and hermione as well but one was missing after being greeted by the entire elder weasley members and having charlie tell him he d only arrived earlier that morning he approached ron and hermione where gin asked harry she s er in her room said ron she hasntbeen herself lately harry hermione added she either out here moping around or she in our room shutting herself away from everyone ron gave harry a pleading look go talk to her harry nodded and climbed the stairs to her bedroom he knocked but ginny didntanswer he opened the door and hesitantly walked in his eyes scanned the room and found ginny on her bed her back to him he crept deeper into the room shutting the door slightly behind him and sat on the edge of her bed as he reached out to stroke her hair she mumbled sod off ron i told you i fine he leaned down and put his lips to her ear such a pretty girl shouldntsay such rude things he whispered she spun around to face him a smile already cemented on her face her eyes were slightly red and her cheeks were tear strained her hair was disheveled and harry thought she looked beautiful without thinking he bent down and kissed her disclaimer i dontown harry potter thanks for the reviews chapter ten romania harry and ron entered into the kitchen of the burrow three days later having successfully passed their apparition tests ron eyebrows rested firmly on their rightful places above his eyes with mr weasley behind them both boys were grinning proudly you passed hermione yelled jumping up from her chair to hug them both where mum asked ron hermione and ginny exchanged looks and harry chest tightened uncomfortably had something happened at grimmauld place said ginny they all are we had to stay behind and wait for you three to get back so we could explain everything and floo there together harry stared anxiously at her well tell us already they ve found another horcrux said hermione what where d they find it questioned ron well they arentabsolutely sure explained ginny dumbledore told mcgonagall that he d planned on checking the location this summer but you know he almost certain that there a horcrux hidden there continued hermione the problem is that nobody can be certain if it the cup or if it another one if it another one we wontknow what it ll look like right said harry quickly but there only one way to find out let get to grimmauld place how asked ron it not on the floo network is it yes said mr weasley it should be but let move we ll need to hurry mr weasley ushered everyone to the fireplace he grabbed a pinch of floo powder and threw it into the fire making the flames rise higher and turn an emerald colour hermione went first yelling number twelve grimmauld place ron followed suit then ginny then harry harry stumbled out of the fire and into grimmauld place right in the middle of a crazy hectic order meeting mrs weasley ushered the four deep into the kitchen followed by mr weasley who emerged from the fireplace after harry bill was yelling coordinates across the kitchen to tonks who was hastily jotting them down on a piece of parchment lupin was hunched over a large map that covered most of the kitchen table and as tonks relayed the coordinated to him kingsley enthusiastically pointed on the map saying things like yes yes there i ve found it and rather far dontyou think mad eye moody and mcgonagall were in deep conversation with moody gesturing wildly and mcgonagall arms crossed over her chest her foot tapping impatiently telling harry that he would be wise to stay away from them for the time being you four ordered mcgonagall when she broke away from moody get over here what going on professor questioned harry as he ron ginny and hermione rushed over to her well there a lot to explain said mcgonagall for the past year and a half charlie weasley has spent much of his time in romania trying to recruit aurors and other powerful witches and wizards for the order it was a rather easy feat considering considering what asked hermione right yes you wouldntknow would you back in the days when lord voldemort was starting to establish himself as a powerful dark wizard mcgonagall explained he was known for his unpredictability he wanted everyone all over the world to know and fear his name he along with his following of death eaters would appear in random places and slay wizards and muggles alike one of the most gruesome and terrifying massacres to ever take place was done by lord voldemort in romania several decades ago he murdered witches wizards muggles even children hermione gasped so naturally it was easy to find people willing to participate many lost family members or were simply tired of living in fear and joined forces with us to extract revenge and make romania a safe place for them and their loved ones what does that have to do with a horcrux harry asked impatiently i didnttell you this yet but when i spoke to albus and he first told me about the horcruxes he informed me that he had intended on traveling to romania and searching for a horcrux this summer he had even planned on bringing you potter mcgonagall said but why would there be a horcrux there asked ron because voldemort needed a truly important place to stash a part of his soul ginny breathed precisely miss weasley affirmed mcgonagall the attack on romania was legendary it was one of the instances that truly solidified lord voldemort status in our world oh but how do you know exactly where the horcrux will be if all of romania was targeted asked hermione it was only a specific area for one thing said bill who had finished giving coordinates and had joined the conversation and charlie was given orders to get a group together and start searching for the object the day after dumbledore burial his team doesntknow they re actually looking for a horcrux though they re only doing spells to detect high levels of magic so they can hopefully find the right place it should be a dead giveaway once they find it since it will no doubt be protected by a ton of spells and enchantments that why charlie was home for a few days ginny asked realization dawning on her he said he came to do something for the order but he wouldnttell me exactly what it was yes that is why he was here he was giving a progress report mcgonagall explained he had a breakthrough recently i ve just arrived back actually i spent the last two days in romania to see things for myself i wanted to make sure everything was in order before i called you lot in and we all left left yes miss weasley left or have you forgotten that these three are coming along on our missions to destroy horcruxes ginny blushed and harry felt a stab of anger mcgonagall didnthave to sound so hostile did she ginny only asked a simple question after all no sorry i aware i just didntthink you d all be leaving right away said ginny mcgonagall nodded yes well we have reason to believe that voldemort has caught wind of our plans and therefore we must act much faster than we d generally prefer to she cleared her throat and looked at hermione we intend on leaving very soon miss granger are your parents aware of your whereabouts and what you ll be doing in the next few hours um yes professor hermione said harry knew she was lying for someone who was usually against rule breaking or deception of any kind hermione had been rather quick to leave her parents in the dark and lie to cover her tracks they still didntknow that she d almost died at the end of fifth year and they most certainly didntknow it was because their daughter went chasing after the most powerful and dangerous wizard alive harry had been told by ron that when her parents had come to pick her up at the train station after the department of mysteries fiasco and mr weasley mentioned something about making sure she was well rested and healed up hermione insisted she had tripped and fallen down the stairs and that mr weasley was just overly concerned and her parents thinking that their dear sweet hermione would never lie to them believed her mcgonagall gave her a suspicious look instantly portraying that she didntbelieve hermione story for a second i know you re of legal age in our world but i expect it would be quite the nasty shock for them if you were injured while enjoying what they d expected to be a safe stay at the weasley house you ve told them you re sure about that granger positive alright then mcgonagall said wearily let get to work so we can hopefully get in and out with no lives lost ginny blanched harry tried to laugh but it came out rather strangled he shook his head dontlisten to her we ll be fine he said she nodded but didntrelax any and you re sure i cantcome she asked that is to be taken up with your mother miss weasley mcgonagall said sternly it is not up to me to decide ginny nodded now come on we must hurry an hour later they were standing in the kitchen with a portkey ready to leave ronald weasley i forbid you to go mrs weasley said for the third time too bad mum i going you cantstop me y know hermione dear please dontleave mrs weasley said rounding on her it dangerous what if you got hurt what would your poor parents think mrs weasley said hermione lightly if i dontgo who ll be there to watch out for these two i promise you that everything will be okay really harry please harry dontdo this mrs weasley begged leave this to the adults we ll be fine i swear i wontlet anything happen to them harry said he caught ron rolling his eyes but said nothing bill talk some sense into them mrs weasley pleaded harry was started to feel badly about things because of harry another one of her sons was being put in danger he wasntstupid he knew that telling ron he d decided ron couldntcome after all wouldntgo over too well besides ron would be valuable and his help might make the difference between life and death but still it didntmake him feel any better about looking at mrs weasley and telling her there was no way they would back down and stay home where she could make sure they were safe mum i going too i cantexactly say anything can i bill sighed harry could tell he wasntthrilled that the three of them were coming along especially ron but he chose to ignore bill for the moment now mcgonagall said sternly this is your portkey harry looked at the off white dusty large muggle clock in her hands this will bring you to the order romanian headquarters where charlie weasley will be i trust that you can all apparate harry ron and hermione nodded harry felt it best to not inform her that he d only gotten his license earlier that morning and ron apparently felt the same for he remained silent as well mcgonagall gave them all the once over right well once at headquarters you will make your way to the area in which we believe there is the horcrux if at any time you are injured mrs weasley gasped or find that you need to escape do not hesitate to leave do not try to be a hero yes i look at you potter because it will only endanger everyone else involved charlie has lowered the barriers around the headquarters for the time being so you can apparate back there if you have to understand yes said hermione ron and harry nodded we ve also brought in a few healers that are associated with the order explained mrs weasley they dontknow all the details they just know that if anyone is injured they re supposed to assist that person in any way possible she looked at ginny and smiled ginny and i will also be here with first aid kits and the like to help she turned back to them and said to ron in particular if i need to use my first aid kit on any one of you it ll be your last mission whether you re of legal age or not do you understand give it a rest mum we ll be fine said ron if they re hurt molly they can apparate back to the headquarters grab a portkey and they ll be back here before you know it so you can treat them said lupin and threatening them doesnthelp the situation you know mrs weasley opened her mouth to reply but mcgonagall cut in okay is everybody ready wait yelled ginny she rushed over to them and wrapped her arms tightly around ron you d better be careful and listen to mum if you get hurt dontbe a git get back here as soon as you can ron who seemed slightly taken aback by her hug merely nodded and patted her on the back she kissed him on the cheek before releasing him and grabbing hermione i know you re smart so i dontthink i need to tell you to be careful but i going to say it anyway ginny said we ll be fine hermione said reassuringly returning the hug nothing will happen to us ginny nodded and moved onto harry she was hugging him so tightly that he thought for sure she d crack a few ribs if she didntlet go soon just please dontdie she whispered harry laughed trying to ignore the pang of guilt he felt he hugged her back tightly not caring if ron was watching i ll try not to thanks for the vote of confidence though he said dryly ginny pulled away and kissed him on the cheek her lips lingered longer on him than they had on her brother and harry wished he could give her a proper kiss before leaving make sure they stay safe she instructed lupin tonks and kingsley they nodded and grinned at her bill dontget too roughed up we have a wedding to be at in a few days and you re kind of scheduled to make an appearance she said hugging her eldest brother i need to say goodbye again mrs weasley announced when ginny backed off oh ronnie be careful please be careful hermione have your wand ready at all times and no close calls like the department of mysteries harry dear if anything happens you grab those two and you get back to headquarters as fast as you can bill i know that you know what you re doing but i ll still worry until you get back safely she hugged and kissed them all before stepping back wiping tears from her eyes i wish i could go with you ron who must ve sensed that it was an inappropriate time to roll his eyes or say something smart merely nodded and said dontsweat it mum we ll be back before you know it i love you she breathed all of you love you too they said together alright now that we re through with the goodbyes mcgonagall said i take it you re all ready to go there was a cheer of agreement from the trio mcgonagall smiled affectionately at them we ll take good care of them molly moody growled and we ll try to make sure nobody needs that first aid kit said tonks give our love to charlie said mrs weasley on the count of three mcgonagall said as harry hermione ron lupin tonks moody kingsley and bill reached out to grab the clock one two three the ground disappeared as harry felt a familiar pull from behind his navel he closed his eyes and when he opened them again they were in another room a larger older looking one hello said charlie it about time you showed up harry looked around the large room he was almost positive that they were in an old castle of some sort the ceilings were outrageously high and everything looked antique behind charlie were about thirty witches and wizards who stopped what they were doing the moment charlie greeted those arriving via portkey sorry we re late mum wasntexactly letting those three go without a fight explained bill as he and charlie greeted each other i expected as much charlie said as he said hello and hugged tonks remus hello kingsley good to see you again oh moody you could at least pretend to be happy to see me he laughed as he shook hands with the three men moody grunted and charlie looked at ron little brother when mum told me you were coming i didntbelieve her what you thought i would actually let you have all the fun without me no i suppose you wouldn t charlie smiled ah hermione how ve you been harry restrained himself from laughing as ron frowned seeing the silly smile that flashed across hermione face as charlie hugged her as good as i can be living with these two hermione joked ron and harry rolled their eyes alright there harry asked charlie shaking his hand sure am said harry when re we going slow down charlie said there still a bit we have to do first because we can send you out allow me to introduce my associates as if on cue a handful of the people behind charlie rushed up to meet everyone charlie pointed to a tall attractive woman with long black hair sharp blue eyes and a small stubby nose this is anastasia stinga the woman smiled and nodded curtly that dimitri pavel a short man with a balding head and long nose waved and over there is ivan meila a heavyset man grunted and wore an expression similar to moody s they ll bring you to the destination and show you possible escape routes we are going to a memorial graveyard zat was set up to onour those who were killed by you know who the woman named anastasia said in a thick accent that sounded much like fleur s just with a deeper voice it hidden in a graveyard hermione asked careful not to let it slip that the it they were looking for was actually a horcrux will we have to d dig up dead bodies zere is a idden passageway underground beneath ze graveyard said another woman she had what appeared to be dark hair that looked purple under the dim lighting we ave determined zat ze tunnel is leading to another place and zat ze place is eavily protected with powerful magic that where we re really going charlie clarified by the way this is cassibellaunus predoviciu the seemingly purple haired woman said reaching out to shake harry hand but you may call me cassi harry nodded and shook her hand you of course are arry potter i ave eard all about you er it nice to meet you said harry cassi one of the top aurors in romania continued charlie she going to be staying here while we go out if any of you need to apparate back here and need to get to grimmauld place for any reason you find her and she ll have a portkey ready for you zat is a lovely colour you ave zere cassi said to tonks are you a metamorphmagus tonks nodded and her hair changed from bubblegum pink to sky blue i am one too cassi demonstrated by changing her hair to a fiery orange so she ron bill and charlie matched wow i dontthink i know anyone else who a metamorphmagus were you ladies ladies we have a mission to get to reminded lupin you can chat later right charlie agreed let get to work we still have a few more things to straighten out before you can leave harry watched as cassi changed her hair back to dark purple tonks made her hair change to black saying that it would be better to blend in with the dark when they were outside valerica cuza is a healer incase any of you get roughed up really badly and arentable to take the portkey back to your headquarters she ll help you out i take it that these portkeys are unauthorized asked hermione an hour later as they were ready to depart ron rolled his eyes at the girl after all the things he and harry had put her through she was still worried about breaking rules had he taught her nothing charlie grinned well unless you d like to explain to the ministry why we need them hermione smiled and shook her head alright you ll take a portkey to a safe house near the destination from there anastasia dimitri and ivan will lead you directly to the graveyard if you sense danger get back here immediately do you understand we understand said hermione harry settled for a nod and ron grunted okay be safe little brother harry hermione stay out of trouble mum ll kill me and bill if anything happens to you lot ron rolled his eyes have you got your wands asked charlie everyone nodded and patted their pockets good they all reached out to touch a piece of the portkey ron shut his eyes tightly he didntlike keeping them open when they traveled this way it made him dizzy on three one two three when he felt his feet hit solid ground once more ron opened his eyes again he was in the dark can we turn on a light or something he asked quietly no came anastasia voice from somewhere to his left if using light wasnta danger we would be doing zis in ze afternoon when ze sun is shining suddenly ron was being pushed forward by someone the moonlight cast a shadow on them and he could now make out their faces let go said ivan follow closely children be ind us adults be ind them wands ready ron hermione and harry walked stealthily behind dimitri anastasia and ivan putting a bit of distance between them but not enough that they d lose sight of their leaders behind them were tonks and lupin and then kingsley moody and bill bringing up the rear they walked for several minutes up a very steep hill in complete silence before finally arriving at the top which was home to a dark creepy cemetery it was a regular muggle looking cemetery but it held mostly witches and wizards they hopped a small fence and crept across the grass stopping in front of a large tombstone anastasia tapped the front of the stone with her wand and then walked around it tapping random places as she went she stepped back and waited there was a low rumble and hermione gasped as the ground underneath them began to shake the stone rose up out of the ground fifteen feet revealing a dark set of stairs that led into the ground zis is where we leave you dimitri said once you are down zere eet is questionable whether or not you can apparate out to be perfectly safe you should try to get outside to zis spot before apparating thank you said lupin we hope to be back at your headquarters soon good luck said anastasia bill smiled nervously at ron ready ron nodded wait tonks hissed when bill went to go down the steps we dontknow what ll happen yet you cantjust walk in without checking things out first she conjured up a rock and tossed it down the steps into the darkness lumos they watched by the light of her wand as the stone bounced down the steps when it hit the sixth seventh and eighth steps they fell away and disappeared as the stone continued bouncing to the bottom count the steps on your way down when you get to the fifth one you ll need to jump down to the ninth get a good powerful jump if you dontgo far enough you ll land on one of the bad steps and fall through and well who knows where you ll end up everyone nodded and muttered lumos tonks went down first followed by bill harry went in next and ron followed closely behind ron felt slightly apprehensive for a moment before gritting his teeth balling his fists and jumping he landed rather ungracefully on the ninth stair thankfully the stairs were very narrow and it hadntproved as difficult or dangerous as he d imagined it to be he turned to watch the next person jump he could see the nervous look on hermione face she was firmly planted on the fifth stair staring at the ninth as if there were a million steps between instead of just three small ones just jump hermione encouraged ron she looked up at him with frightened eyes i ll catch you i promise she nodded shut her eyes crouched and leapt forward she narrowly avoided bumping her foot on the eighth stair and falling backwards ron arms instantly sprung forward and grabbed her pulling her close to him thanks she whispered he nodded and let her go watching as lupin kingsley and ron found this sight extremely amusing moody hopped down to safety they walked a bit further bill leading the way all on guard with their wands ready they followed bill down a long dark corridor in a place like this it was hard for ron to forget that he was underground he thanked merlin that the tunnel was most likely held up by magic or else it would ve come crashing down on top of them already there was a dirt path underfoot the walls were dirt and he expected that the ceiling was too it was rather cold they all preformed heating charms on each other before going any further a putrid smell filled ron nostrils and he tried not to think about what could ve caused it could there be dead bodies around there somewhere the bodies of those who d tried and failed in their own personal attempts to retrieve the horcrux he no longer felt it important to waste his time worrying about the spiders that were more than likely all around them he kept his eyes peeled for any approaching signs of danger but even with seven wands lighting their way they were only able to see a few feet in front of their faces stop harry commanded after several minutes of walking everyone immediately stopped dead in their tracks and looked at him ron knew that harry wand had been deposited back into his pocket for he could see a faint glowing light coming from the inside of harry robes his eyes were closed and he was breathing deeply heavily as if every ounce of him was concentrating on something they couldntsee or even really understand nobody spoke as they watched him harry raised his arms and pressed his hands firmly against the wall of the tunnel feeling blindly for something that didntappear to be there hermione threw a concerned look at ron but he shook his head and stared confidently at harry harry knew what he was doing at least ron hoped that he did it here what here lupin asked quietly what is it harry everything said harry nobody move dontgo any further too dangerous give me a minute i need to figure out how to he outlined an invisible path along the wall ron brought his wand closer to harry allowing him the ability to see what he was doing but harry eyes remained shut a flicker of orange light passed from harry open palms into the wall where it was absorbed suddenly four thin long planks appeared in front of them which stretched across as far as ron could see which wasntvery far it was then that he realized there hadntbeen any ground in front of bill and had harry not stopped them from walking they all would ve plummeted into the big pool of water which was a few steps ahead of them and about three feet down harry eyes flew open and he turned to ron a mixture of shock and excitement on his face what what happened how did you know asked ron i i not sure said harry i just knew we can all marvel at potter unknown abilities later moody barked right now we need to keep moving four of us will go first and the next three will follow behind who wants no said harry there a reason there four boards to get across on four people at the most can be on the other side of these planks at a time are you sure harry questioned tonks positive something similar to this happened when i went with professor dumbledore if hermione ron and i were still underage we could all get across without setting anything off because underage wizards didntmatter to voldemort when he set the spell but who goes with you then kingsley asked harry you decide ron and hermione are coming with me he said instantly ron and hermione grinned it doesntmatter who the fourth person is whoever wants to come i ll go volunteered bill but if only four people can cross the planks well what would happen if the other three swam across in the water underneath them ron didntmiss the look on harry face nor his shudder trust me when dealing with voldemort the last thing you want to do is voluntarily get in the water advised harry seeing everyone confused looks he muttered inferi ron inhaled sharply and was suddenly very nervous about crossing the thin planks what if he fell in oh said bill he looked about as uneasy as ron felt okay you heard him everyone under no circumstances are we to go near water if you cantavoid it added harry heat and light will work to get rid of them he pulled his wand out of his pocket the light still coming off of it and said wands ready c mon we ll be waiting right here lupin said this time it was hermione nudging ron along as they approaching the planks stepping onto them ron was pleased to find that they were wider than they appeared and accommodated his large feet rather well he walked for what felt like an eternity before the board came to an end and was replaced with solid ground again he turned back and could no longer see tonks lupin or moody though it was mostly due to the thick darkness and not any great amount of distance that was between them they walked onward every now and then stopping so harry could feel the wall or take a look around what do we do now bill asked harry you ve done this before anything we should know about like what asked harry well is there anything we can do to help us know where the horcrux is a simple spell maybe suggested bill you honestly think that you know who would go through all this trouble only to let a simple spell be the ticket to getting his horcrux asked ron bill scowled and narrowed his eyes at ron look little brother i ve got more experience than you do when it comes to stuff like this perhaps you should shut up and let harry answer my question ron rolled his eyes but said nothing he was on his first order mission and he wasntabout to let his brother ruin it for him nothing could ruin this moment so is there anything bill asked again not exactly but using the summoning charm helped a bit last time answered harry everybody be careful though because once i summon the horcrux any hexes that are guarding it will spring into effect they all nodded and gripped their wands tighter okay ready accio horcrux almost right away ron heard someone call watch out and turned just in time to see something fly toward them and make contact with the person to his left he heard a gasp of pain and almost passed out from the dread that suddenly hit him along with a wave of nausea when they hit the floor okay one thing could ruin this moment so who was it you ll have to wait to find out haha i so evil review disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter eleven back at headquarters hermione screamed ron he dropped to his knees beside her his eyes wide are you alright can you hear me hermione blinked and tried to sit up she felt a sharp piercing pain course through her body and settled back against the dirty ground what had hit her it looked like one of those ninja star things she had seen in muggle movies or perhaps it had been an automatic severing charm of some sort whatever it had been it had been sharp and as it had passed her it had slashed across her shoulder i yes i fine she whispered you can oh ron gasped and cursed what is it asked harry who appeared at her side bill was behind him she bleeding ron said with a shaky voice she bleeding a lot oh shit said bill look at all that blood hermione scowled at their filthy mouths but decided it wasntthe best of times to lecture them there was blood her shoulder was hurting yes but was it really bleeding what are you talking about hermione asked worriedly dontjust stand there help me up harry bent down to get a better look at her he and ron carefully picked her up trying not to hurt her she cried out in pain as she gently moved her left shoulder using her other arm she brought her wand up to her injured shoulder and gasped her robes were already starting to soak with blood the ground was completely red where she had landed get back to headquarters ordered harry he sounded nervous hermione narrowed her eyes at him i told you that i fine she insisted stubbornly i dontneed to go to headquarters i didntask your opinion harry said sounding bolder though he still looked worried i not hermione bill said no i know what i feeling better than you do and i not hurt at all she protested it looks far worse that it really is although that wasnttrue it was extremely painful in fact the only thing that exceeded the hurt she felt right now was at the department of mysteries when she nearly died at the hands of dolohov and that was only the aftereffects because she lost consciousness immediately after the spell was preformed regardless she wasntabout to pack it in and accept defeat just yet they were on a mission and a little injury wasntgoing to jeopardize that hermione said ron a concerned look on his face he took her right hand in his and stared into her eyes pleading with her to go back it fine that you dontthink your injury is all that serious nobody will think badly of you because you got hurt just go back to headquarters and get treated for me please she sighed and looked at her feet wincing when her shoulder gave another painful throb okay thank you he said i ll walk you back across the planks hermione would ve protested saying she was perfectly capable of doing it herself but the look in his eyes told her not to argue she merely nodded and smiled at bill and harry before turning around and walking in the opposite direction i ll send someone back with ron in my place she promised are you sure you re alright asked ron as she winced yet again yes she lied in truth she was getting an almost unbearable jolt of pain through her neck shoulder and arm every time she moved when they finally came to the small wooden planks that led the way across the dangerous water hermione took a shaky breath and walked across much slower than she d done before she ignored the pain in her body and focused on not falling ron was on her right on another plank concentrating as hard as she was ron hermione what happened questioned tonks hermione hurt something flew out at us and cut her shoulder explained ron someone needs to walk outside with her so she can apparate back to headquarters i ll go tonks volunteered she cast another look at hermione remus will you help me lupin nodded thanks and someone can come back over with me as the fourth person ron continued i will said moody okay come on ron said they went in one direction and hermione tonks and lupin went in the other she ll say she fine but she bleeding rather badly so dontlisten to her he yelled hermione laughed softly and kept walking he taking this too seriously she said i really not in that much p pain she tried to sound strong but her voice betrayed her coming out quiet and weary she winced when her shoulder brushed uncomfortably against the jumper underneath her robes she was beginning to feel dizzy and she was having a hard time keeping her eyes open how much blood had she lost ron right you re bleeding a lot the entire left side of your robes is covered lupin noted examining her shoulder oh tonks gasped hermione are you okay that looks terribly painful wh what no i fine n never better why was this tunnel so long had they done this much walking when they first went through it come on we re almost there said lupin his voice sounded soothing and it reminded hermione of her father she missed her father and her mother too she instantly regretted not telling them about the missions because they were bound to find out now and she d be in quite a bit of trouble when they did her right side slumped against lupin and she blinked several times mentally urging herself forward at last they arrived at the stairs remus no way out hermione heard tonks say opening must ve closed trapped forget hope we re close enough to the outside safe to apparate lupin said they sounded far away to hermione were they talking about her she was having trouble focusing on their conversation in no condition stairs fall through hermione hermione hermione opened her eyes when had she shut them to see tonks staring at her need to focus cantget outside apparate here right apparate she d apparate to headquarters and everything would be okay if only she could focus like tonks had said to do she knew she wasntgoing to be able to do it without splinching herself unless she focused alright to do that asked lupin side along if you re not no said hermione though her voice sounded faint and strange to her own ears i can d do it i can f focus she cleared her throat and her eyes fell shut she took a deep breath and tried her best to picture the room at the romanian headquarters when she opened her eyes she winced and tried to adjust to the lights in the castle where was charlie charlie she groaned hermione saw bright red hair rushing over to her bloody hell covered in blood what happened portkey i need to get to headquarters hold on cassi portkey now a woman who hermione assumed was cassi appeared from around the corner holding something in her hands everything was going fuzzy someone grabbed her right hand and placed it on a hard cold object count of three one two three she was vaguely away of a strange feeling in her stomach and the disappearance of any solid ground underneath her feet she heard a loud shriek and struggled to open one of her eyes she saw more red hair hermione charlie what happened it was mrs weasley with mcgonagall behind her hermione shut her eyes again and tasted copper in her mouth her throat felt thick when she swallowed dontknow mum the healer of course ginny get someone bleeding looks bad hermione groaned and felt a protective arm go around her waist her head lolled to the side as she fell back into somebody she forced her eyes open and saw a tall red haired man holding onto her looking concerned she smiled dreamily at him ron she whispered before passing out ginny was a wreck it was getting close to two hours now that they d been gone what if something happened she wished her mother had let her go with them she could only imagine what they had encountered what if voldemort had figured out what they were doing and showed up with his death eaters harry ron and hermione were no match for them even with tonks lupin kingsley and moody they d had too many close calls already what if this one was it what if they didntcome back she was lying on one of the couches in grimmauld place waiting for everyone to get back safely when she heard her mother scream her heart stopped as she sat up and ran to the kitchen she was already shaking she knew it was bad was it harry ron what had those two idiots done now hermione hermione oh merlin what was wrong with hermione please let her be okay look at her oh no charlie what happened to her is she alright mrs weasley questioned ginny finally made it to the kitchen just in time to see hermione eyes close she was swaying dangerously on her feet charlie was behind her looking oddly pale shaking his head mcgonagall looked utterly shocked and with a shaky hand she covered her mouth and gasped examining the left side of hermione robes i i dontknow mum said charlie she needs to see the healer now oh yes of course agreed mrs weasley she spun around and came face to face with ginny ginny get someone to help hermione and hurry ginny nodded and ran upstairs where the two healers were talking waiting for someone to be brought in for them to treat she bleeding a lot mum it looks bad i dontknow what could ve happened she heard charlie say audrey called ginny as she flew up the stairs almost tripping over her feet earl she found them in the first room to her left looking eager but concerned someone get to the kitchen now the two healers nodded and ran out of the room with ginny hot on their heels what is it audrey asked as they entered the kitchen ginny gasped and stopped dead in her tracks hermione was passed out in charlie arms looking dangerously pale she bleeding we dontknow what happened said charlie hurriedly bring her into the living room and set her down we ll help her said earl yes yes hurry sobbed mrs weasley please ginny took one look at her mother who was crying and shaking and knew it was bad no it was worse than bad charlie picked her up careful not to move her left side ginny was rather sure this was where her injury was and carried her to the living room he set her down on the floor and backed away as audrey knelt beside her and made a quick slicing motion with her wand the sound of fabric ripping covered the heavy silence in the room as hermione blood soaked robes tore at the shoulder allowing audrey to pull them off and revealing hermione torn jumper ginny gasped at the large deep cut on her shoulder her bone would ve been visible ginny was sure if it wasntfor all the blood gushing out of the wound her sleeve was completely coloured with blood and a tiny pool of the red liquid was forming underneath her on the floor audrey waved her wand again and the jumper ripped carefully audrey peeled it off the wound biting her lip in concentration waving her wand one final time and muttering something under her breath the cut disappeared fresh skin healed over the area earl came back into the room ginny hadnteven realized that he had left with a red potion he handed it to audrey who tilted hermione head back opened her mouth and poured the potion in the colour almost instantly returned to her face and she coughed but didntregain consciousness she lost a lot of blood earl explained that was a blood replenishing potion that we gave her will she b be okay asked mrs weasley oh yes said audrey after a long moment she got to her feet and smiled i expect that she ll be right as rain in an hour or two there are no infections at least none that i can see she should rest for a bit though can you get her to the couch sure said charlie he and earl lifted hermione up off the ground and put her on the couch where she groaned and rolled onto her right side but still didntwake what could ve done that to her merlin what re they dealing with on these missions cried mrs weasley her weeping had ceased only to be replaced by anger and worry i cantbelieve my ronnie is still out there bill and harry too oh no ginny heart clenched she d completely forgotten about harry and her brothers she felt a new sense of panic was over her as she looked at the pool of blood on the floor hermione blood she was lucky she made it back to headquarters and she was helped by a healer what about ron would he make it back if he was hurt harry would probably try to go on ignoring the fact that he was injured bill was tough but voldemort was a lot more powerful could they hold up against the spells voldemort put in place to protect the horcrux what if they didntmake it back what if they were all dead what if hermione was the only one who got away could it be that she was in the best shape out of them all ginny dear go back home and get some other clothes for hermione the ones she wearing are all bloody and torn said mrs weasley ginny shook her head no i not leaving mum what if something h happens while i gone i c cant i d dont okay said mrs weasley i ll go if anything happens while i gone someone had better come and let me know charlie nodded and ginny collapsed onto the other couch trying to slow her racing heart she watched as her mother went to the fireplace threw in some powder stepped into the flames and yelled the burrow she returned ten minutes later but it was almost another half hour before hermione woke up ginny heard a groan and jumped to her feet as hermione rolled over and opened her eyes hermione hermione sat up quickly looking around ginny is ron okay what about harry ginny shook her head i we dontknow yet they still arentback hermione yawned and touched her bare shoulder it was fully healed the only sign that she d been injured was that the skin was slightly redder on the spot that had been cut open her jumper hung limply on her left side revealing the top of her bra mum brought some clothes from the burrow for you said ginny hermione shook her head and stood up no there no time i ve got to get back excuse me asked ginny she stared incredulously at hermione as she got up and rushed into the living room you arentgoing anywhere yes i am argued hermione ginny followed her into the kitchen where mrs weasley and mcgonagall were talking quietly i need to know what going on i cantbe expected to just sit here and wait miss granger i am extremely relieved to see you up and about mcgonagall said wearily but make no mistake if i need to i will put you in a full body bind to keep you out of danger and i have sent an owl to your parents informing them of your condition hermione opened her mouth to protest but was cut off by mrs weasley jumping up from her chair and hugging her tightly you gave us such a scare said mrs weasley please stay here with us your parents wouldntwant you to go out again either hermione nodded and half heartedly walked back to the living room she sat down on the couch and sighed angrily i should be out there she said hermione i know you want to go help but i glad you re not said ginny you didntsee yourself you were so pale and you lost so much blood i was fine she insisted actually hermione is it you were not fine said audrey coming down the stairs in fact if you hadntmade it back here when you did you mostly likely wouldntbe alive right now i what that right said audrey she walked over to the couch and extended her hand audrey fiske i a healer hermione granger hermione said quietly pleasure she shook her hand and smiled sweetly as i was saying you lost quite a bit of blood we gave you some blood replenishing potions and healed your wound it was rather nasty may i ask how you attained it she rubbed a dark pink watery substance onto hermione formerly injured shoulder ginny froze audrey may be with the order but she wasntallowed to know about horcruxes how could hermione talk her way out of this one oh you know someone conjured a severing charm let just say they need to work on their aim a little laughed hermione audrey nodded but didntlook the least bit convinced it was a blatant lie no question about it but audrey was trained to know better than to press hermione on the matter right said audrey well i just came down to apply this and to see how you re doing if you re feeling any pain or discomfort come get either earl or myself we ll be upstairs thank you said hermione as audrey went up the stairs do you mind telling me what really happened asked ginny had hermione been telling a total lie or had a severing charm really been used on her and just not in the context hermione had implied if it was true that would mean that someone had to conjure it and nobody on their side would do that okay said hermione she still looked pale possibly due to loss of blood but more likely because everyone was still out there she folded her legs underneath her body and leaned forward like she was gossiping instead of explaining how she almost died we took a portkey to this place and then walked for a really long time to the cemetery when we finally got there one of the graves rose out of the ground and turned into stairs there were some trick steps so you had to jump over them and then we wound up in this really dark cold tunnel it sounds creepy said ginny it was i suppose hermione shrugged anyway we walked for a long time and then ron hermione stopped and she and ginny leapt up from the couch neither girl moved waiting for everyone to traipse into the living room and announce that they were all safe they had been gone a long time but had it been long enough for them to have been successful or was ron simply injured like hermione and had to come back ron stumbled into the living room he was limping with strange look on his face ginny heart sunk she was almost positive it had something to do with harry she held her breath harry was dead wasnthe how had it happened why wasntron saying anything ginny deserved to know how he died hermione a big stupid grin stretched across his face as he quickly hobbled over to them and hugged hermione she started to cry and ron quickly pulled away shite i hurt you didnti no hermione said sobbing she shook her head and hugged him again i so glad you re okay ginny ignored them and turned back to the spot where her mother was lupin walked in from the kitchen followed by a black haired tonks moody trotted in after them and kingsley entered the living room next bill came in wincing as he moved chatting with mcgonagall mrs weasley was next with tears in her eyes and a worried expression on her face and then finally harry appeared his hair was messier than usual and his glasses were hanging off his face he looked exhausted and sweaty and had a big cut on his forehead dried blood was caked on his face starting at the spot over his right eye and going down to his jaw he looked slightly dizzy but he was still harry and he was still alive he didntget a chance to go deeper into the room because ginny was already running toward him at full speed when she reached him she threw her arms around him tightly and nearly knocked him over from the impact before she realized what she was doing she was crying and calling him a git harry put one hand behind her head and pulled her face to his kissing her softly and then pulling back to look at her a smile playing across his exhausted face he wiped away her tears with his thumb and kissed her again after they separated ginny was relieved to see that nobody had paid any attention to them she went down the line and embraced everyone else finally hermione asked the question that was on everyone mind did you get a horcrux mrs weasley smiled that can wait until later dear if anybody needs to see a healer there are two upstairs when nobody moved she folded her arms and said bill weasley dontthink i didntnotice how stiffly you were moving and harry you get upstairs and clean yourself up this instant harry sighed and grudgingly followed bill up the stairs to the healers ron are you alright come here let me get a good look at you mum i fine it was bloody amazing said ron well at least at first he cast a worried look at hermione you re sure you re okay he asked hermione nodded after more pestering ron obliged and humoured mrs weasley turned around and letting her examine him from all angles he managed to stand steadily on his bad foot and avoided being sent to the healer ginny knew this was the smartest thing for him to do since their mum would never allow him to go on another mission if he came back with even a scratch on him once he passed the inspection ginny couldntcontain herself and wound up giving him another bone crushing hug i love you whispered ginny even though you re rather daft at times thanks i think laughed ron and i love you too even though you act like a brat most of the time harry emerged from upstairs looking good as new followed shortly thereafter by bill who had been treated for a few bruised and cracked ribs audrey and earl came down next said a quick goodbye and then left okay ginny said eagerly did you get the horcrux or what harry shrugged and pulled a large green gem from his robes this is all we found he said quietly ron frowned it doesntseem very important though when it comes to lord voldemort anything can be important said mcgonagall she pulled out her wand and ushered everyone back into the kitchen harry sat the gem on the table and everyone crowded around and watched as mcgonagall muttered an incantation and pointed her wand at the stone ginny held her breath she tried to remember what happened last time mcgonagall preformed the spell it had taken a moment before the horcrux had had a reaction she recalled she told herself not to panic if nothing happened right away that bloody thing had better start glowing said ron because i sure as hell didntstick my neck out for a bloody useless rock ron scolded hermione watch your language no you got hurt it better not have been for nothing he argued ginny was so caught up in the amusement that was ron and hermione that she almost missed the bright glow coming from the stone the purple glow was stifled by the emerald colour of the jewel but the point got across all the same it was a horcrux ginny squealed and couldntcontain her grin as mcgonagall repeated the same spell that she d used on the locket to destroy the gem when she finished an odd muffled cry rang out before the horcrux disintegrated and disappeared good work mcgonagall said four down two to go said moody right you lot mrs weasley pointed at ginny harry hermione and ron back home it been a hectic day and you all need your rest disclaimer i dontown harry potter this chapter was written before i realized that you probably cantapparate into a house for security reasons however in ootp fred and george apparated from their bedroom at grimmauld place into harry and ron s so i figured there were some circumstances in which it was possible i took it to mean that if you live at are in a specific place you can apparate throughout it therefore for the purpose of this story hermione harry and ron can apparate throughout the burrow chapter twelve apparating ron mind was racing how could his mum honestly think he d be able to go to bed after the adventure he d just been on he d gone on an order mission with aurors and everything he had trekked through a dark dangerous not to mention spider infested cave and stolen a seventh of you know who soul and after doing all that he was expected to sleep really crack ron harry ron sat up and squinted in the dark trying to figure out where harry voice had come from he reached for his wand but harry had already whispered lumos and illuminated the room what re you doing here being that it was back to being only the four children and mr and mrs weasley in the house they were all given their own rooms harry was currently staying in fred and george old room while hermione was put up in percy s i couldntsleep and i had a feeling you couldn t either said harry come on get out of bed we re going to hermione room why asked ron i think we know hermione rather well by now and i d be willing to bet my firebolt that she awake too said harry only she d never directly break the rules and get out of bed on her own so we ll need to coerce her into it does that sound about right i suppose so let go ron didntmove fine stay here if you d like i apparating to hermione room whether you re coming along or not stated harry ron didntlike the idea of harry and hermione alone in her bedroom in the middle of the night we re just going to pop in without any warning she wontlike that maybe we shouldnt said ron though he lacked conviction the worst case scenario she asleep in which case we ll just disapparate out and she ll be none the wiser ron nodded and grabbed his wand just incase before he and harry apparated to hermione bedroom apparently neither boy had gotten the hang of things because they both landed on the floor with a thud it about time you two showed up said hermione in a business like tone by the light of harry wand ron could see that she had been sitting up and waiting for them i was beginning to think you were actually sleeping crookshanks meowed and leapt off the bed to brush against ron leg lumos muttered ron and hermione at the same time he suddenly wished he d had the sense to change his clothes before suddenly appearing in hermione room he normally wore his pajamas the ones he d long since outgrown but tonight proved too warm and he d finally just stripped down to his boxers and a t shirt before settling into bed and there he stood in front of hermione in his shirt and boxers his chudley cannon boxers sleeping us come off it said harry who by ron inspection was wearing the exact same thing as he was his boxers were blue and not chudley cannon though shall we go get ginny oh i think we d better she might kill us if she found out we didntinclude her in this said hermione getting out of bed noticing that her sleepwear was just as scant as his and harry s ron forced himself to look away moments later he was standing in ginny room hermione and harry on either side of him the landing was slightly better than it had been previously instead of falling he merely stumbled a little gin are you awake whispered harry harry ginny sat up quickly do you oh hey everyone were you sleeping asked hermione a small smile on her face we can leave if you were no she said quickly i wasn t i dying to hear about the mission ginny flung herself off her bed and sat on the floor somebody start talking ron laughed appreciatively and sat down harry and hermione followed suit we ll get to that later first i want to hear what happened with hermione i um she cantanswer that ginny interjected she hasntgot a clue what happened she passed out right after she got back to headquarters what hissed ron harry gave hermione a concerned look before casting a silencing charm on the room you passed out he asked merlin i didntrealize you were hurt that badly i was fine hermione maintained whatever you say said ginny hey i would ve traded places with her in a second she was on the couch enjoying a nice nap while i was pacing the room all but pulling my hair out over you two idiots she said looking from harry to ron and back you didntneed to worry about us harry said quietly of course i did insisted ginny she the careful one of you lot when she turned up like that i was fine i could only imagine the state you two would be in when you got back if you even got back at all we were in good hands argued ron harry a brilliant leader ginny shook her head it not that i donttrust harry abilities good said ron because he got some wicked abilities you should ve seen it he did this thing with his hands it was wandless magic he did asked ginny i did asked harry you did hermione confirmed it was rather interesting actually she turned to ginny we were walking in pitch darkness mind you and all of a sudden harry stopped and started feeling the wall ginny laughed that sounds a bit nutty to me yeah i thought he was mad at first agreed ron but then he started tracing this pattern on the wall with his eyes closed and this beam of light shot out of his hand it did asked ginny it did harry asked incredulously you didntknow questioned hermione no i felt something but i thought maybe i just imagined it my eyes were closed remember i figured my hand just brushed against something and it made me feel that way well you did some sort of wandless magic said hermione that probably how the planks appeared in the first place but how did you know when to stop i could barely see an inch in front of my face and you managed to keep us from falling into that water i guess i have better eyesight then you do replied harry ron rolled his eyes you have better eyesight you wear glasses and your eyes were shut anyway how did you do it asked ginny i dontknow after we got past the stairs and started walking i shut my eyes said harry it was easier in a way almost like i knew where i was going and where everything was even though i couldntreally see it when we came up to the water i knew but i didntknow how i knew it was almost like someone was telling me what to do voldemort asked ginny her voice barely above a whisper no harry said firmly it different when he in my head i dontknow what it was really what is like another sense hermione asked not really harry said it it complicated i cantexplain it but whatever it was it was definitely a good thing is that how you knew what to do on the wall it looked like you were writing some kind of code or something in order for those planks to appear i guess my eyes were shut but i could see the pattern in my head i tried to trace it out on the wall that sounds really weird said ginny well not weird but certainly not normal harry grinned and shrugged dumbledore said that magic always leaves traces i guess i know voldemort well enough to identify his and i know what to do to counter it i suppose that possible hermione said thoughtfully he tried to kill you more times than i can count if you dontknow him well by now i d think there was something seriously wrong with you laughed ron so what happened after i left you asked hermione after you crossed the planks what did you do well we walked for a bit more and then harry told us to stop again ron recalled all of these weird sharp looking things like the one that cut hermione shot out at us we had to stay really low to the ground or else we would set off this sort of alarm and more would ve flown out at us so we started crawling on the ground inching our way further when we came to more water harry did that weird thing with his hands again and more planks appeared but there was only two that time harry now looked as confused and intrigued as hermione and ginny did i did more wandless magic you dontrealize when you re doing it hermione asked sounding flabbergasted his eyes were shut again explained ron but anyway we were lying there on the ground and we knew we had to cross the planks but there was no way that we d be able to do it without standing unless we wanted to wind up in the water he shuddered what did you do ginny asked ron grinned i was sure we were either going to rot there forever or get hit with one of those flying things and die but out of nowhere harry stood up he did what i did what harry stood up said ron he turned to harry you you dontremember no i dontremember that he muttered it was bloody amazing exclaimed ron he stood up but nothing shot out at him it was like he figured out how to move without being detected and then he turned to moody bill and me we were all still on the ground scared out of our minds and he said who going to come across with me then he stared at us like we were just on the ground to take a bloody nap or something ginny laughed and harry gaped at ron in disbelief who went asked hermione though she sounded like she already knew the answer i did of course ron said proudly but it was a lot harder than it seemed none of us wanted to get up incase we triggered those things again but harry was looking at me like i had two heads because i was still flat against the ground so i got up nothing happened and so moody and bill got up too bill started arguing with me saying he d go with harry because i wasntready to handle it how did you convince him asked ginny ron shrugged i got on one of the planks before he could stop me harry was on the other one already and bill couldntcome after me because three people would ve done something funny and we all would ve been killed he and moody had no choice but to wait there for us it was just the two of you hermione gasped what happened next asked ginny ron opened his mouth to reply but firmly shut it as the floorboard outside of ginny room creaked someone was outside the door that ron said is a story for another time ginny groaned but nodded climbing back into her bed i rather enjoyed this we should do it again sometime she said harry lifted the silencing charm and the trio disapparated harry apparated into ron room a second after ron did yawning and looking slightly concerned about something ron asked you really dontremember doing any of that harry shook his head as ron cast a silencing charm on the room no i don t he said truthfully he couldntunderstand why he didntremember ron wouldntlie about something like that so it had to have happened had he just blocked it out and had he really done wandless magic without even realizing it weird said ron y know you re kind of scary in a way what asked harry why well not scary really more like intimidating if you hadntbeen my best mate for the past six years i dontthink i d know how to handle myself around you really definitely said ron come on you ve got to admit it some of the things that you do are a little y know i honestly haventthought about it said harry he intimidated ron he hadntmeant to did everyone else feel this way around him did ginny dontget me wrong the stuff you do is amazing ron said quickly but it still a little strange i mean you re barely seventeen and you can do wandless magic you can walk around in the dark in a huge trap set up by you know who with your eyes closed and somehow manage to do better than the rest of us could with our eyes open and our wands raised yeah but i didnt blimey harry you can do all that you can fight you know who and survive every time but you still canteven be proud of yourself fine would you rather me be full of myself harry asked feeling his anger rise to the surface would you rather me embrace the fact that i the bloody chosen one trust me ron it isntas wonderful as it might seem i didntsay it was i just said that it wouldntkill you to acknowledge the fact that you can do a lot of great things exclaimed ron the way i see it i not doing anything particularly wonderful it not like i want to do these things in fact i d gladly trade lives with anyone else in a second snapped harry you think i was looking for horcruxes tonight because i want to incase you haventnoticed i donthave a choice what do you mean you can decide whether or not you want to fight you can show up or not show up and i sorry but it doesntreally seal anyone fate if you don t but me i have to fight if i don t voldemort takes over and everybody suffers harry said quietly if i don t nobody can stop him you know about the prophecy you know that i the only one who can get rid of him i guess mumbled ron yeah and i cantjust turn my back on that if my parents had never been killed or if i had never survived if the name harry potter had never meant anything to anyone i wouldntdo these intimidating things i do them because my parents are dead and i not i do them because being harry potter means doing dangerous things from time to time i do them so i can kill voldemort so i can get revenge for what he did to me and my parents and so i can finally have some peace you ll be pretty relieved once this is over then huh you have no idea said harry he hesitated before deciding he could talk openly to ron he had virtually no secrets from his best friend who knows maybe i ll die in the end but i donteven think i d care he whispered what ron hissed what the hell are you talking about you dontmean that i do as long as i defeat voldemort i really couldntcare less about what happens to me admitted harry if i live great i ll be with you and hermione and and ginny but if i die i ll be with my parents and sirius either way it sounds fine to me i prepared to die for the cause i ve been prepared since i was eleven death is just the next great adventure he said echoing dumbledore words ron looked as if he might be sick you you cantbe serious harry you arentgoing to die you dontknow that said harry i wake up every single day knowing that it might be my last that it might be the day voldemort decides to come for me can you say that can you say that you could die at any moment no ron said shaking his head and i glad for that but i can and after a while you learn to accept it ron shook his head again and sat down on his bed still looking shocked at the thought of harry dying harry was rather surprised that their conversation was lasting as long as it was normally whenever he talked about voldemort or dying ron found a way to change the subject perhaps he didntrealize just how real the situation was until they went on the mission for the horcrux perhaps the fact that hermione had been injured sort of drove home the fact that at any given moment it could be the end of the golden trio let face it harry whispered i a marked man i have been since i was one year old even if i get rid of voldemort his followers will still be alive they ll still want me dead that why you ve got me you take care of voldemort and i ll take care of his death eaters ron said and what ve i got hermione for she not going to like not being included in our plans laughed harry well she ll have to deal with that ron said curtly she and ginny can sit at home and wait for us to come back like tonight harry smiled and nodded speaking of ginny he needed to see her they hadnthad a chance to be alone since he d gotten back and a part of him was crying out for her i getting a bit tired he lied he faked a yawn and said i ll be going to bed now right said ron i will too harry didntbelieve him for a minute he apparated back into ginny room and grinned when he saw her sitting up in her bed waiting for him she got up and threw her arms around him i thought you were dead tonight she whispered harry laughed softly and then mentally scolded himself why hermione was cut really badly you didntsee her she was so bloody pale and i remembered mcgonagall saying voldemort might ve known what we were up to she said quietly she took a deep shaky breath and harry knew that she was crying i thought that m maybe some death eaters h had shown up and y you were gone s so long and i her sobs drowned out the rest of what she said harry hated himself what did he do to deserve her why did she have to give a damn about him why did she have to be sick with worry every time he did something dangerous he did a lot of dangerous things was she going to be affected like this every time if she didntcare it would have been easier but if she didntcare harry would be empty he d be utterly lost without her he kissed her forehead and rubbed her back lightly when she calmed down she pulled away and asked will you stay with me tonight your mum will kill you if she finds us in the morning she ll tell your dad and he ll tell your brothers who will kill me i dontcare if you don t she whispered he hesitated let quit dancing around the subject harry she paused for a moment you cantpromise me that you ll be alive in a year but you can at least promise that you ll stay tonight my mum might walk in tomorrow and see you in my bed i dontcare do you harry shook his head no i dontcare gin she smiled and nodded nox he said putting out the light of his wand they crawled into bed and harry held onto her as her breathing evened out and she fell asleep with her head on his chest harry would die for the cause he would die for his friends and he would definitely die for the girl in his arms but maybe just maybe he wouldnthave to if he lived it would be for them it would be for ginny it was too hot in hermione room she couldntsleep she had spent the last five minutes or so since returning to her room trying to get comfortable the blankets on her bed were too heavy to sleep under so she finally settled for lying on top of them she sighed and tried to clear her head but it was useless she had too much on her mind to fall asleep now crack hermione sat up and looked around are you awake she heard ron whisper i am now she laughed reaching for her wand lumos she whispered sorry he apologized i hope i didnt i can go if no hermione said quickly stay i need to talk to you she gestured toward the opposite end of her bed and ron sat down beside her feet a strange expression on his face merlin he was on her bed what d you need to talk about asked ron he stretched out and stifled a yawn staring at her with serious eyes i she couldntsay it she couldntadmit that she had been wrong about something it almost never happened sighing she looked down at her hands and said quietly you were right ron laughed excuse me did i just hear you say that i was right about something no need to rub it in ron stuck out his tongue and laughed again well are you going to tell me what i was right about or am i supposed to guess you were right when you told me to get back to headquarters she admitted i wasntfine the healer said that if i hadntgotten back when i did i i would ve died the smug smile slid off of ron face and was replaced with a look similar to the one he made when he was coughing up slugs in their second year shite but but you re okay now right he got up and moved closer to her yes i fine ron rolled his eyes and hermione laughed it wouldntkill you to take that word out of your vocabulary ron scolded nice choice of words sorry no i sorry said hermione i knew i was hurt but i was too stubborn to admit it i didntwant to leave i know that you dontlike to admit that you need help but that not why i didntwant to go she confessed i ve never not gone on a mission with you and harry not counting second year when i was petrified and the thought of sitting at headquarters while you were out there wasntthe most appealing i was afraid that you two would get hurt and i wouldntbe there to help oh please you cantget rid of me that easily she smiled get rid of you i wouldntdream of it of course sometimes i d rather like to smack you ron looked down at his hands i have been quite a git in the past haventi you sure have said hermione she laughed and ron grinned up at her although i ve done a thing or two to provoke you i suppose maybe ron said lightly but a few things i ve done on my own like calling you a nightmare or when i talk with my mouth full just to irritate you or snogging lavender hermione asked quietly she could ve kicked herself when she saw the pained expression on his face maybe he had dated lavender to get back at her but it wasntright of her to throw it in his face especially when they were actually having a civil conversation though she was sure he was about to mention it anyway ron frowned and nodded snogging lavender definitely that was one his eyes left hers again and traveled down to her previously injured shoulder he moved the strap of her top out of the way and brushed his thumb softly against her skin she inhaled sharply and he pulled away as if he d been burned did that hurt no she said it it was okay in truth it was much better than okay she couldntbelieve the sensations he could create just by touching her shoulder since when did she start melting at his touch about um lavender he said slowly not making eye contact i didnt i mean you were she was she was what asked hermione thoroughly amused she was an absolute nightmare laughed ron hey said hermione i take offence to that as i was once deemed a nightmare by you i feel it rather unfair for me to have to share that title with lavender brown i d like to think i fall under a different heading that her trust me you re a whole other category insisted ron she felt herself blush and was thankful that ron still wouldntlook at her and i think we already covered that i was a git when i said that about you but since you like being a nightmare i guess i ll need another term for her i can think of a few my favourite is a vindictive manipulative insecure annoying thick utterly miserable absolutely that works yeah ron said his amused cobalt eyes trained themselves on hers again i cantbelieve i dated her i can t either he took a deep breath before saying i i he sighed i think i ll go to bed now hermione tried to hide her disappointment she had been sure he was going to say something else i ll see you in the morning right said hermione goodnight ron smiled weakly putting a hand on her cheek he said i glad you re okay before she could say anything he disapparated i despise school but until my parents start taking my suggestions i need to continue attending bear with me please disclaimer i dontharry potter thanks for all the reviews i love hearing from my readers chapter thirteen the preparations ouch ron you elbowed me in the eye again if you d quit moving around so much it not my fault that you keep pushing me off the edge every three minutes and i need to fight to stay on the bloody bed harry if you d just sleep on the floor you wouldntneed to worry about me elbowing you or pushing you off i d rather sleep on the floor but there no room ginny sat up and glared through the darkness this is the second night in a row that i ve lost sleep because of you two idiots hermione shifted beside ginny everybody calm down she said evenly it bad enough that we all have to sleep here together cantyou all please shut up and let me go to sleep ginny sighed and leaned back on the mattress it had been five days since harry hermione and her brothers went to romania tomorrow was bill and fleur wedding and the day after that was ginny birthday the burrow was now filled with distant relatives of the family who would be attending the wedding mrs weasley had stuffed ginny hermione and harry into ron bedroom with him to make room ginny and hermione were in harry bed and ron and harry were in ron bed the room fell silent and ginny began to drift off to sleep again it was about two in the morning she guessed so it was technically already tomorrow she had to be up at seven but hadntgotten to bed until after midnight now she was up again if she didntget some sleep she d probably pass out from exhaustion during the ceremony and the two imbeciles in the bed next to hers werenthelping harry quit kneeing me in the ribs bloody hell ginny muttered under her breath keep it up ron and harry knee will be the least of your worries would you both stay still demanded hermione he wontstop moving complained ron you take up too much space harry grumbled then switch ginny growled harry can sleep with me and hermione can sleep with ron harry is not sleeping with you insisted ron he sighed heavily ginny i your brother you can sleep with me if you ve got such a bloody problem with everything ginny scowled so it was perfectly fine for him to share his bed with hermione but because that meant harry would be in her bed it wasntallowed what a double standard fine said ginny then i guess i ll sleep in your bed and harry can sleep with hermione in this one hermione rather pretty though i hope harry doesntget fresh with her in the night hermione get over here ron said quickly ginny smirked into the darkness and hermione sighed before getting on her feet leaving ginny by herself on the bed she heard a creak on the opposite side of the room as harry got up from ron bed he climbed in beside her and put an arm around her dontget any ideas potter she whispered harry laughed and pulled her closer to him she sighed contentedly and got as close to him as possible tomorrow was the wedding harry would have to make a decision she knew she should ve felt slightly nervous or unsure but the way he was holding her she was positive that they d be together by the time the wedding reception was done she felt too safe in his arms to think otherwise she shut her eyes and listened as ron mumbled something to hermione and she settled down beside him there ginny said when everyone was still can everybody sleep now yes they said ron going to keep his elbows to himself and harry not going to knee me in the ribs or anywhere else right yes okay goodnight goodnight oh zis is orrible hermione eyes snapped open it was still rather dark in the room and a little early for even her to be waking up a tiny almost non existent amount of light was filtering in through the curtains allowing her to see ron who was sleeping beside her she was on her side facing him with his arm draped over her hip she smiled and closed her eyes again ze wedding cannot appen now zis is a disaster what the wedding was off fleur and bill wedding hermione slowly got out of bed careful not to wake ron and crossed the room to where ginny and harry were snuggled up in their bed her head was on his chest and his arms were wrapped protectively around her they looked so peaceful together that she felt bad for disturbing them but hermione grew annoyed when she poked ginny in the arm and the girl groaned but didntwake the room was silent and fleur cries could be heard clearly from the kitchen ginny wake up whispered hermione she tapped her again no i like it here ginny mumbled her eyes still shut it too early to get up she sighed and harry opened his eyes blinking stupidly go to sleep hermione murmured harry his hand began lazily tracing small circles on ginny back yeah the wedding isntfor hours said ginny although she was right hermione knew ginny really had no idea what time it was anyway she shifted and smiled slightly we re sleeping incase you haventnoticed there isntgoing to be a wedding hermione whispered hoarsely cantyou hear fleur crying down there she said the wedding isntgoing to happen harry smiled weakly seemingly half asleep i guess we can sleep in then huh he laughed ginny giggled softly and hermione scowled phlegm said the wedding was off asked ginny hermione nodded waiting for ginny to get out of bed instead she whispered thank merlin i wonthave to wear that awful dress harry chuckled get up this instant ginny we have to go downstairs and see what wrong why cantyou go by yourself asked ginny whose eyes were still closed i not going i love my brother and i suppose i can live with her being his wife but there no way i going to drag my arse out of bed thisearly just to play matchmaker for them hermione couldntgo by herself what if fleur and bill were downstairs breaking up she and ginny might be able to walk into the kitchen and calm them down but it d be horribly inappropriate and completely out of the question for only hermione to walk in and try to sort things out you re coming with me hermione said quiet but firm come on hermione let us sleep pleaded harry they have cold feet that all there no way i coming with you muttered ginny the sun isnteven up yet yes it is ginny opened her eyes okay so it is but barely hermione rolled her eyes i dontwant to go i warm in here of course you re warm hermione whispered angrily it august it always warm besides you ll need to get up soon anyway harry ginny said sleepily closing her eyes again and burying her face in his neck tell her to leave me alone harry sighed leave her alone hermione ginny laughed i dontwant to get up she complained if the wedding really off i say we stay here all day hermione you can take ron down to my room and keep him busy and you and harry will harry yawned and smiled keep busy i cannot believe zis ow could zis ave appened i was supposed to ave a wedding today ginny eyes snapped open when fleur sobs filled the room they ve really called it off hermione shrugged she didntknow what had happened but from the sounds of it bill had really called it off shit ginny exhaled dramatically and sat up let go harry sighed and shut his eyes sleepily as ginny climbed over him and left the room with hermione now fleur everything will be fine said mrs weasley you can just have three bridesmaids instead of four hermione and ginny cautiously crept into the kitchen to find fleur crying at the table being comforted by mrs weasley and fleur sister gabrielle hermione wasntsurprised to see that fleur mother wasntthere comforting her daughter she probably needed her beauty sleep yes fleur eet will be okay said gabrielle who was rubbing her sister back as she sobbed onto mrs weasley shoulder nobody will notice that she is missing ginny yawned mum what going on mrs weasley looked up at the girls and frowned it appears that one of fleur bridesmaids had an accident of sorts and she wontbe able to participate in the wedding ze numbers will be uneven bill will ave four and i will ave three cried fleur and you re going to let that ruin your wedding that ridiculous hermione said incredulously she didntmean for it to sound so accusing but the look on gabrielle face told her it had my seester is not she is right said fleur zis is our day allete wontbe zere and things will be uneven many of our family will point eet out and laugh but i do not care i am going to ave my wedding mrs weasley sighed in relief and gabrielle smiled at her sister crisis avoided ginny mumbled so only hermione could hear can i go to back to bed now hermione shrugged i suppose she said quietly we re going back to bed for a little while hermione announced to the women in the kitchen wake us if you need anything else she hadntmeant it literally only as a friendly offer one she never imagined fleur would take her up on i ave an idea exclaimed fleur you can be my bridesmaid ermione wh what hermione stammered at least fleur had gotten her name right for once i cant i cantbe a bridesmaid i donthave a dress and i dontknow what to do oh i sorry but i can t fleur shook her head and stood up no you can zere is ze dress zat allete was supposed to wear hermione tried to remember which one allete was was she the one who was full veela allete she couldntput a face to the name will it fit her mum asked ginny who seemed to be enjoying the scene before her more than she should have i suppose we could give it a try said mrs weasley she considered hermione for a moment she about the same height and oh right allete was the one she and ginny called the toothpick allete was tall and insanely thin hermione gasped and shook her head again she was fairly slim herself but she was no toothpick i cantdo it she said nervously but of course you can said gabrielle ginny and i are doing it hermione couldntsee a way out how could she possibly tell fleur she wouldntcooperate fleur wasnther favourite person in the world but she was marrying a weasley and hermione would do anything for a weasley they were all too wonderful to disappoint and she knew that bill and mrs weasley would appreciate it if she agreed nodding she reluctantly said okay have you seen hermione asked ron the wedding was starting in a half hour most of the guests were outside the backyard was rather full by now leaving only the wedding party and other important family members harry included inside harry shook his head no ron nodded and went back to the mirror where he was desperately trying to master the art of tying a tie he couldntbelieve he had to wear one it was bill wedding when it was ron wedding ron would wear a tie did he honestly have to wear the thing nobody would be looking at him anyway sighing he let it hang loosely around his neck and turned away from the mirror he had never had that much trouble with his hogwarts uniform i cantbelieve she got roped into being a bridesmaid said ron harry stared blankly at him who hermione oh right harry said he furrowed his brow and stared off into space looking like he was in deep thought about something ron wanted to ask him what was going on with him today he d been spacing out like this since they d woken up and started getting ready for the wedding but something told him it would be best to ignore his friend and hope it would pass harry didntworry about insignificant things he worried about things like voldemort or horcruxes anything harry had to be concerned about couldntbe something ron particularly wanted to hear before bill wedding a happy occasion that he was celebrating with his family perhaps it had something to do with lucius malfoy breaking out of had been on the front page of the daily prophet three days ago but that couldntbe what harry was thinking about this strange mood of his had only started a few hours ago and he d known about malfoy for days fred and george came into the room looking good harry said fred ickle ronniekins is wearing a tie gushed george what a man he turning into shut up snapped ron harry you re sitting with us during the wedding fred said harry looked up at them huh yeah yeah right i am he nodded and looked away again the twins gave him a strange look since we werentasked to be involved in the ceremony at all george said loudly knowing that bill was walking by ron eldest brother came in the room i cantbelieve it said fred shaking his head slightly we re family and we donteven get a small role charlie your best man ron a groomsman even ginny involved exclaimed george harry head snapped up at the mention of ginny fred said yeah come on bill what re we supposed to do bill cleared his throat you re supposed to sit down and not make a scene you re supposed to keep all of your jokes and products away from the guests he recited as if reading from an invisible rulebook you re supposed to avoid percy and if you cantavoid him you re supposed to remember that if you cantsay anything nice you shouldntsay anything at all percy i forgot he d be here said ron he didntwant to see his brother the one who as far as he was concerned wasnt his brother especially after last christmas but his mum had made bill invite him and not even mr weasley was going to say otherwise that goes for all of us continued bill i sure each and every one of us would like to hex percy into oblivion but not today not at my wedding i ll be damned if i let anything ruin this for fleur ron cleared his throat and left the room harry close behind him they heard a loud series of screams echoing from the floor below them followed by fred and george laughter and bill screams of what did you do ron and harry rushed down the stairs to the room where the girls were supposed to be putting on the finishing touches ron pushed open the door and froze fleur was screaming and waving her hands above her head as if protecting her hair from something oriel fleur best friend was shrieking and pointing at something near the ceiling gabrielle was ducking and trying to calm her sister down at the same time ginny looked thoroughly amused as she watched the three girls shriek hermione dress wasnton properly on it was the perfect length off the ground and fit fine in the waist the problem wasntuntil you saw her chest which wasntcovered by anything except her bra the section of the dress that should ve been there was hanging down around her sides she had her wand out and was waving it around shooting spells into various corners completely unfazed by her appearance at last the cause for all the excitement was stopped hermione managed to stun a slimy hairy winged creature that had been flying around the room and had no doubt been slipped inside by fred or george oh cried hermione who finally noticed that ron and harry were standing in the doorway she crossed her arms over her chest and blushed ginny smiled at them and pulling hermione along walked over can you zip me up asked ginny putting her back to them ron was about to do it he could ve sworn she had been looking at him and she was his sister after all when harry carefully moved her hair out of the way and gently pulled up the zipper taking slightly too long in doing so ginny turned around again thanks hermione and i need to go see mum she looked at hermione who was avoiding their eyes the toothpick dress fits well in the waist but it turns out that she got a rather flat chest we need to er increase the bust in the dress or shrink hermione s she laughed not funny ginny let go find your mum so i can cover myself up okay dontget your knickers in a twist said ginny she smiled and they walked away to find mrs weasley ron ron spun around and saw bill rushing toward them what happened who was screaming bill screeched gabrielle appearing in the doorway you cannot be ere eet is not right for you to see fleur before ze wedding is everything okay in there asked bill yes eet as been cleared up gabrielle said before disappearing back inside the room and shutting the door okay you said bill pointing at ron get upstairs and have someone fix your tie and you he pointed to harry go get ginny and hermione and have them get all the girls to line up outside we re starting this thing in a few minutes harry nodded and went off to find hermione and ginny ron went upstairs and found charlie who tied his tie for him ten minutes later everyone was scrambling to get outside and start the ceremony bill and charlie were already out there waiting for everyone else to come out okay said mrs weasley who was rushing around trying to get everyone in order we ll start with ginny and mason ginny hair was in tight curls and her gold dress complimented her fair skin and hair colour rather nicely she was standing beside a tall attractive blonde boy about ron age mason was fleur favourite cousin according to bill and although he seemed a tad standoffish ron was under strict orders to be friendly gabrielle dear you re next stand beside seb seb was a friend bill made while in egypt who had gotten in that morning just in time for the wedding gabrielle long blonde hair was in the same style as ginny and the pale gold of the bridesmaids dresses made her hair appear all the more silvery hermione is here and ronnie you re beside her said mrs weasley pointing at the spot behind gabrielle and seb i cantbelieve i doing this muttered hermione i mean look at me ron grinned at her and listened as his mother directed oriel the maid of honour to stand behind them oriel was stunning and ron was fairly certain that she was half if not full veela nonetheless ron thought hermione looked much nicer than oriel get over yourself said ron you look great she smiled and blushed her brown hair was no longer bushy and frizzy it was sleek and curled framing her face the gold dress she was in hugged her curves nicely and made ron feel short of breath you look lovely dear mrs weasley told fleur as she and her father stood behind oriel fleur was in a white wedding dress and her long hair was in a fancy upsweep she had ron great auntie muriel tiara on her head and it sparkled against her hair she was holding onto her father an older looking blonde man okay it time to move good luck mrs weasley slipped past them and went to find her seat ginny and mason walked down the aisle slowly and everyone else moved up a few steps gabrielle and seb went next walking in the same pace as the previous two i look ridiculous i cantdo this whispered hermione as she and ron began moving again ron rolled his eyes she didntlook ridiculous at all if anything she was outshining the bloody bride come on hermione you cantquit now y know i bet voldemort must seem like a joke now huh ron joked hermione sighed and ignored his sarcastic remarks you re doing this whether you want to or not i not walking down that aisle thing by myself i ll carry you i ll drag you if i have to they walked down the aisle together putting on fake smiles as they went chairs were on either side of them the weasley family on one side and fleur family on the other ron could see harry at the front beside fred george and ron parents ron also saw percy who was sitting far away from the family with the minister of magic to his left ron felt a new sense of hate toward his brother the only reason he had come to the wedding was so scrimgeourwould have a chance to speak with harry percy was probably counting the minutes until he could leave and return to his beloved ministry and now so was ron when they got to the altar that had been put in especially for the wedding ron and hermione split apart and stood on opposite sides of it ron stood beside charlie waiting as oriel walked down the aisle and stood beside hermione music began to play as fleur and her father appeared when she let go of her father arm and came to stand beside bill ron couldnthelp but smile at the look on his brother face despite what any of them said about fleur she made bill happy bill loved her someday ron would find a girl who made him feel like that ron shifted his gaze to hermione who was staring at him fondly he grinned and she blushed slightly but didntlook away maybe he had already found her review disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter fourteen the wedding hermione was surprised to find that weddings in the wizarding world were not unlike those in the muggle world there were bridesmaids and groomsmen the father gave the bride away and the couple exchanged rings and vows there were some differences though after the rings and the vows there was the binding ceremony in which the couple souls were magically bound together forever she d read all about it of course but it was one thing to read about something and another thing entirely to experience it one thing hermione didntknow but was pleasantly surprised to discover was that divorce wasntan option in wizarding marriages after the ceremony there was a huge feast prepared by mrs weasley followed by dancing the altar and wedding layout in the backyard were gone now replaced by several tables and chairs and an area for dancing ginny was across the backyard chatting with tonks and professor mcgonagall hermione ron and harry were sitting at one of the tables when a tall boy with red hair and freckles approached the table he was very good looking and he seemed to know it too hello ron he said brightly eyeghun said ron through a mouthful of food hermione shook her head at him but said nothing ron swallowed and smiled in what appeared to be a forced way this is my cousin have you met my friends ian he pointed at harry this is harry potter ian said quickly he shook his hand eagerly and grinned it great to meet you harry when i heard that you were here with ron i thought for sure it was some kind of joke hermione noticed ron narrow his eyes at his cousin but ian didntnotice he was too busy going on and on to harry about how badly he d wanted to meet him but continued ian who now turned to look at hermione harry isntthe reason i came over here you are i am asked hermione you are what your name hermione she said quietly it s um nice to meet you hermione didntthink it was all that nice though the pleasure is all mine he said smoothly i noticed you during the ceremony you look very stunning in that dress would you care to take a walk with me so we can get to know each other better hermione blushed at the mention of the word stunning she smiled and nodded politely but truthfully she didntwant to go off with him she was supposed to be at this wedding with ron at least that what she thought he hadntmentioned her going with him since the day he d asked her and even then it hadntbeen too clear as to what he had meant exactly i sure these two wontmind me taking you away ian chuckled ron was currently shooting daggers at ian his face was slightly red and he looked as if he was going to throw a punch at any moment hermione exchanged looks with harry and hesitantly stood up she felt a hand take hold of her arm ian gripped her arm tightly and she risked a glance at ron as she was being led away from the table actually said ron stepping in front of his cousin i do mind well ron that isntreally my problem said ian i can make it your problem hermione eyes widened and she looked to harry for help harry jumped up from his seat and approached them quickly ron said harry remember where you are yes dear cousin you wouldntwant to make a scene at your brother wedding would you ron gritted his teeth his face almost the same shade of red as his hair you bet your arse i would ah yes i d forgotten how much of a temper your part of the family had barked ian he leaned in closer to ron his eyes narrowed and his mouth pulled into a smirk worthy of malfoy but you ve got to have something i suppose tell me what it like to be best friends with the pretty girl and the famous boy and still be a worthless ron was about to punch him when harry reached out and caught his fist harry was too busy restraining ron to pay attention to hermione however and before she even realized what she was doing she had slapped ian across the face with her free hand tell me she said angrily as ron and harry gaped at her what it like to be so utterly jealous of someone that you feel the need to personally attack them with absolutely ridiculous accusations ian glared at her for a moment there was the faint outline of her handprint on his left cheek you re absolutely mad and now that i think about it you arenteven that pretty he spun around and almost bumped right into ginny ian hello she greeted though it sounded more like some sort of threat hello ginny lovely wedding yeah well i should go congratulate bill see you he said quickly without another look at any of them he rushed off he always been rather frightened of me ginny laughed at first i tried to correct it but now i like to have a little fun with him harry smiled at her ron was grinning but not at ginny he was staring at hermione with a look of awe and admiration on his face i think i enjoyed that even more than when you punched malfoy hermione punched ian asked ginny no but she slapped him harry grinned and it was bloody brilliant exclaimed ron oh i wish i d been here i could ve gotten a smack or two in myself said ginny i cantstand that git i cantbelieve he family right well c mon hermione let dance said ron hermione tried desperately to hide her grin as she followed him out to the dance floor as they left ginny and harry she heard ginny say ron always hated ian ron always hated ian ginny told harry as ron and hermione left i starting to dislike him myself said harry and i ve only known him for five minutes he sat back down in his seat and sighed ginny was going to ask him now they had agreed to wait until the wedding to talk about them and there they were at the wedding alone it was the perfect situation to discuss what they needed to discuss phlegm looks rather nice in her dress i have to admit said ginny she sat down in hermione vacant chair and stared across the backyard at bill and fleur er yeah harry said awkwardly would she get mad if he said that fleur looked pretty she had said it but would she care if he did too you look great too gin ginny smiled thank you it was a lovely ceremony dontyou think yeah very nice said harry was she making small talk with him him in some ways this bothered him even more than if she would ve brought up the question that was no doubt on her mind was she waiting for him to bring it up perhaps merlin he was terrible when it came to girls no he was fine with hermione she was a girl andmost of the time he was okay with ginny he had no problem talking to mrs weasley tonks or mcgonagall they counted as girls didntthey they were female they counted harry had not felt this uncomfortable around ginny since his first stay at the burrow when she spent the majority of her time watching him or hiding from him they sat in an uncomfortable silence for several minutes before the blonde boy that had been one of bill groomsmen walked up ginny ello i ope i am not interrupting anything he said hey mason said ginny cheerfully no it fine would you like to sit down actually i was oping you would dance with me mason said casting a nervous glance at harry unless are you and arry harry felt a pang of jealousy when ginny smiled at his request for a dance he was tempted to tell him that they were in fact a couple just to bother him and send him back to his table with a dejected look on his face but then he realized that he was no say in anything ginny did because they were not a couple not officially no ginny said quickly i d love to dance with you ginny looked at harry and raised her eyebrows as if daring him to say something she wanted him to stop her harry could tell she wanted him to speak up and claim her as his he watched her and mason go he didnteven know what he was going to tell her when she asked he had been trying to come to a decision about them for an entire week when he had suggested waiting until the wedding to decide whether or not he was willing to put her at risk by dating her he had thought that would give him a ton of time to decide he hadntthought that in the time between then and now he d have found two horcruxes studied for his apparition test spent an insane amount of time at grimmauld place doing research and strategizing despite their efforts the order progress was at a standstill and helped prepare for the wedding in his head he d imagined the past two and a half weeks very differently now he was hoping that he d be able to look at her and just know the answer so far he hadnthad that particular luck in fact he was looking at her now and all he could think was about how badly he wanted to hex mason for touching her for even looking at her was that a sign that he should be with her not really he was aware of his feelings for her you couldntspend twenty four hours a day with someone an ex girlfriend who you were not over by any means and want to be with more than anything without falling in lo did you miss me ginny asked returning to the table harry throat was suddenly too thick to speak he nodded and stood up dance he forced out taking her hand and leading her onto the dance floor ginny smiled and put her arms around his neck harry rested his hands on her lower back and breathed in deeply her hair smelled like heaven it was vanilla and strawberries and flowers mixed together with an extra special secret ingredient thrown in where d you keep your wand in a dress like that harry asked the gold dress was deliciously tightand harry didntknow where she would stash her wand i dontknow about the other girls but i keeping mine in my room said ginny you donthave a wand is that safe ginny laughed of course it is we re only in the backyard y know do you have yours on you yeah said harry why are you planning on being attacked today you never know harry said jokingly but it was possible a big group of wizards including harry potter aurors and many known order members that reminds me said ginny i spoke to mcgonagall she had to go back to hogwarts but she said to tell you that there will be another meeting tomorrow at headquarters harry nodded you re taking this very well taking what very well well i ve never really enjoyed my birthday but you always get excited when it yours said harry yours is tomorrow and we ve got to spend it at an order meeting and that means that fleur planned the wedding for the day before your birthday stealing your thunder dontyou think ginny sighed to be fair fleur didntknow when my birthday was when she set the date but bill did said harry i suppose i ll just have to hate him forever then she said sarcastically it doesntreally bother me to be honest wow little ginny weasley all grown up shut up ginny rolled her eyes and rested her head on his chest harry sensed that it was about to happen sure enough ginny lifted her head again took a few deep breaths and asked have you have you thought about what we talked about before harry paused before saying yeah i have she looked up at him expectantly and they both stopped dancing her eyes her beautiful brown eyes bore into his soul he remembered the first time he saw her at the train station he remembered the way she looked running alongside the train desperate to get to hogwarts and join her brothers she was so free and happy and full of life regardless of what she said or did no matter how hard she tried harry could still see little ginny weasley inside of her from time to time she was still the sweet little girl who put her elbow in the butter dish and would blush a furious shade of red whenever harry entered the room or looked in her direction she was the helpless child who had been possessed by lord voldemort when harry closed his eyes he could still picture her there lying on the floor in the chamber of secrets incredibly pale and near death and he couldntdo that to her again if something happened to her this time around something worse and she lost the old ginny harry would never forgive himself i can t he whispered ginny face fell harry brought his hands up to cup her cheeks forcing her to look at him gin i why couldnthe say it it wasntthat complicated he d never done it before but it had always seemed rather easy his throat was dry and his tongue felt swollen in his mouth but he forced himself to say it i love you ginny eyes were watered over and harry could tell she wanted to protest but she said nothing i ve never loved someone before except maybe sirius and my parents and things didntexactly turn out great for any of them he said that how things work for me anyone that i love gets taken away from me i know that you probably hate me now but i d rather you never talk to me again than be taken away forever because i couldntcontrol myself ginny covered her hands with his and gently removed them from her face she looked down at her feet i donthate you harry i could never hate you she said quietly she raised her head and her eyes met his i she shook her head sadly and gave a strangled sort of laugh it doesntmatter now but it did matter she walked away weaving in and out of people she passed ron and hermione who were still dancing and harry saw hermione whisper something to ron and follow ginny ron came over to harry and they walked back to their table both sulking for a different reason harry didntbother to ask what was wrong with ron he didntparticularly care at the moment it was a few minutes later that they heard mrs weasley screams hermione and ron joined the other dancing pairs and hermione had to look away when mrs weasley nudged mr weasley and the two smiled encouragingly at hermione as ron put his hands on her lower back and pulled her close i hate ian ron told her as she wrapped her arms around his neck i cantimagine why she said dryly he not even a month older than me but for some reason he got it in his head that he superior every time i see him he points out that he got something i haventor done something i haven t i d love to see his face if i said ian last week i went on a mission with the pretty girl and the famous boy and we destroyed part of you know who soul what did you do during that time that lousy git said ron keep your voice down scolded hermione but i suppose ron continued ignoring her he d just tell me that while i was off gallivanting through a tunnel underneath some graveyard in romania he was playing quidditch in his backyard with his brothers and sisters and somehow try to convince me that he was still better i rather glad i slapped him hermione smiled proudly i am too although i wish harry hadntstopped me from punching his lights out you can get him next time she said comfortingly ron laughed hermione caught a glimpse of ian about fifty yards away staring at them as they danced merlin he watching us ron looked around spotted his cousin and gestured rudely at him hermione didnteven scold him she considered giving him a gesture of her own but decided against it ian enraged her more than she had expected he clearly thought that he was the most amazing creature to ever walk the earth he was arrogant and rude but that wasntwhat bothered her she couldntstand what he d said to ron the way he acted like ron was something he d scrape off the bottom of his shoe and as she saw the look on his face as she danced with ron she felt the urge to slap him stirring inside of her again you didn t um want to go with him did you asked ron no she said quickly i just didntwant to be rude good ron said sounding relieved i know him a lot better than you do and his idea of getting to know you better isntexactly the same as yours i sure hermione shuddered no i sure it isn t he a huge prat ron supplied and he a liar too hermione raised her eyebrows in question you are that pretty she felt herself blush and gingerly leaned forward to rest her head on his chest as they danced she spotted ginny dancing with fleur cousin mason and wondered where harry was when the table they d been sitting at came into view she saw that he was still sitting there looking confused and slightly annoyed they remained silent for a few moments before hermione spoke since when do you know how to dance ron laughter rumbled in his chest i ve always known how to dance what about the yule ball in fourth year padma said she had a horrible time because you wouldntdance with her wouldnt is the key word said ron i was too busy sulking over you hermione laughed softly i get it she said you were so shocked from the realization that i was of the female gender that you couldntthink straight much less dance i knew you were a girl he said firmly i just i didntthink you d ever settle for going with me so i didntbother asking i wanted to go with you hermione took a deep breath and closed her eyes she could hear his heartbeat which was strong but slightly quicker than it had been a minute ago no you didn t he said though he didntsound sure of himself you had vicky she pulled away and looked at him viktor invited me to visit him in bulgaria during the summer before fifth year she said she could feel herself getting angry with him why did he always need to bring viktor into everything and do you know where i was during that summer i was at grimmauld place with you that where i wanted to be not with viktor ron smiled weakly at her that where i wanted you too and not just because i didntlike viktor you didntlike viktor hermione asked faking surprise i d have never known if you hadntadmitted to it now ron laughed ginny who had long since broken off from mason was now dancing with harry they appeared to be in heavy discussion about something hermione sighed and put her head back on his chest once we re done with this party i suppose i ll have to pack my things why ron asked sounding alarmed my parents want me to come home dontyou remember oh his face fell right i remember but why now mcgonagall sent them an owl about my injury and the next morning when they replied they said that they wanted to bring me home immediately i told them i wasntleaving until after the wedding and the wedding over now so they ll be here tonight you cantgo home exclaimed ron not yet we need you here that what i said but they dontseem to care very much hermione said sadly she lifted her head off of his chest once more and looked at him when am i going to see you again then we probably wonthave any school in september are your parents going to make you stay with them until harry gets rid of you know who and it safe again hermione looked down at her feet they dontreally know all that much about voldemort actually i ve never given them too much information and when mcgonagall wrote them she didntmention anything about what i was doing when i got hurt because it was a security risk for us and them so how do they think you got hurt i not sure she said but they re taking me back home that what matters you and harry will have to go on those missions without me i suppose maybe if we talk to your parents they ll they wontlisten ron this is it i going home ron sighed and put a hand underneath her chin forcing her to look at him again he looked nervous and slightly worried and she wondered what would be the cause hermione i i um she was sure he was about to say something important but it was at that exact moment that ginny walked past them huffily looking furious and slightly teary eyed heading toward the pond i should go see if she okay hermione said reluctantly ron nodded and watched concerned as his sister disappeared from sight giving him one last look hermione let go of him and followed ginny when she finally found ginny the girl was sitting by the pond staring angrily into space and sniffing ginny ginny wiped her eyes but didntrespond not caring if her dress got a grass stain on it hermione sat down beside her friend he doesntknow anything about l love ginny wept it didnttake hermione long to figure out who ginny was talking about she put a comforting arm around ginny shoulder he thinks he protecting you she justified from wh what death eaters voldemort it n nothing i h haventf faced before ginny cried indignantly she took a deep breath and crumbled into hermione he said h he l loved me and that he didntw want to lose me i l love him but do i get any s say in whether or n not he fights n no harry loved her she knew that he cared about her yes but she hadntknown that he loved her and ginny loved him too hermione had already known this but the enormity of ginny feelings for harry hadntreally hit her until now oh i so sorry whispered hermione she thought she heard a strange noise behind her but couldntturn to investigate because ginny was now sobbing onto hermione shoulder perhaps harry had come after ginny could hermione ever love someone like that did she already love someone like that she and ron had been best friends for years and she loved him but she loved harry too they were both her best friends harry was like her brother she d always felt something more for ron something different but did she love him as anything more than a friend she liked him a lot but love suddenly it seemed like such a difficult concept to grasp there was another noise behind hermione this time ginny also heard it the girl calmed down slightly and gave hermione a curious look they turned around and watched as three figures in black hoods stepped out from the trees death eaters they both got to their feet instantly hermione reached for her wand it wasntthere damn it she had decided that she didnthave a place to keep it so she had left it in her room at the burrow she hadntthought anything dangerous would happen ginny gasped and took a small step back hermione couldntthink of a way out nobody knew where they were nobody aside from ron and harry had even known that they d left the backyard they were alone far away from the rest of the wedding guests without wands and there were death eaters surrounding them well well well it looks like these two arentso tough without potter here to protect them one of the hooded figures said it had a female voice bellatrix lestrange hermione knew which shall we kill first asked lestrange ginny stiffened beside hermione we must act under the dark lord orders another one said it was lucius malfoy you know what we are here to do yes although i quite sure the dark lord would be rather pleased if we got the other brat out of the way too lestrange muttered but fine you there she pointed her wand at ginny get over here ginny didntmove dontmake me curse you girl get over here now ginny gave hermione a fearful look and took a few steps forward hermione wanted to cry to scream bloody murder until harry came and saved them but she couldn t she was frozen in fear very good said lestrange she grabbed ginny arm roughly and pulled ginny stumbled forward and wound up at lestrange side unusually pale with her face scared and concerned lestrange turned to hermione again now what shall i do with this one we must make sure she doesnttalk she pointed her wand in hermione face and said cruc no the third death eater screamed deflecting the spell with his wand hermione cringed and almost wished he hadntstopped lestrange from using the cruciatus curse she didntneed him to do her any favours she knew who the third death eater was she knew that voice well enough she had heard it far too many times for her liking it was snape we have our orders hissed snape we must only take the weasley girl leave the mudblood for one of the others take the weasley girl they were going to take ginny hermione snapped out of her shocked state no you canttake her silly girl malfoy barked we can do whatever we please as you will soon find out your side is outnumbered you picked the wrong side you filthy mudblood not that our side would ve ever taken you hermione was suddenly aware of the shouts that were coming from far off in the distance they were coming from the burrow there were more death eaters they had attacked everyone at the wedding they had attacked ron hermione ginny panted wrestling against lestrange grip tell harry that i silencio ginny kept squirming her lips were still moving but no sound was coming out anymore hermione felt hot tears running down her cheeks knowing that if she didntthink of something soon that if harry didntcome soon ginny would probably die how touching snape said sounding disgusted the weasley wants to tell her little boyfriend s omething we need to go said malfoy he pointed his wand at hermione be sure to tell potter that my son and i look forward to seeing him soon say goodnight mudblood stupefy everything went black disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter fifteen the crisis ron stood up quickly and looked around beside him harry did the same thing his mum had screamed he wondered what could be the matter did something bad happen or was she merely being overdramatic about losing one of her sons to marriage but why would she scream and then he saw them death eaters there were tons of them they were in the backyard of the burrow where ron family was they were going to hermione where was she he pulled his wand out of his robes as fleur screamed oh this was terrible this was worse than terrible what were they going to do most of the people at the wedding werenttrained aurors or anything of the sort a good amount of them were still underage or too old and feeble to defend themselves death eaters were ruthless they would capture and torture a baby if they thought it would make even the slightest difference ron turned in a circle and saw that there were death eaters in every direction he could see tonks fighting one of the biggest death eaters ron had ever seen lupin was close by fighting another one a few other people around them were throwing hexes and jinxes at the black robed intruders but nothing was working there were more screams by the second coming from every direction hermione had followed ginny she wasntin the backyard anymore she was probably safe she and ginny were probably talking somewhere completely unaware that this chaos was happening dontget killed harry said in an almost threatening tone he pulled out his wand and rushed toward one side of the madness ron took a deep breath and ran off in the other direction to where the other death eaters were he knew the drill it was time to fight a death eater having just been stunned fell in front of ron path another one came up and pointed his wand at ron but ron was quicker stupefy he yelled he didntwait to watch as the death eater fell help someone was screaming he scanned the area and found the source of the terrified shrieks a death eater was pointing their wand at his little cousin heather this was crazy heather was only ten over the noise he could hear the death eater sick booming laughter what was that bastard going to do to her bloody hell ian was there he wasnteven defending his sister he was standing a bit behind her with his hands out in front of him and a look of absolute horror on his face ron couldntbelieve it if that were ginny ron would be hexing the death eater into next week not standing there like an idiot the death eater muttered silly girl avada petrificus totalus yelled ron hitting the death eater in the back his limbs snapped to his sides and he fell to the ground stiff as a board when ron stepped over him he couldntresist giving the man a swift kick in the gut two more death eaters came at him expelliarmus it seemed almost as if every death eater in the backyard had the ability to split themselves in half there were so many there was no way the order could fight them all they were everywhere how could ron get his family to safety heather didntknow magic she didnteven have a wand yet if it wasntfor the fact that ian was shifting around nervously ron would ve thought he had been put in a body bind ian ron said quickly take heather and run i can help he said like you helped save your sister from almost getting killed asked ron starkly more death eaters came out of nowhere and though most tore off in the direction harry had gone several were still making their way toward ron impedimenta protego ron said quickly run heather ran away but ian stood there frozen in fear staring at ron get to a safe place commanded ron as he deflected a spell crucio ron dove to the ground and narrowly avoided the spell damn it he yelled at his cousin just go tarantallegra one said pointing at ian who was trying to run away his legs began dancing and tapping involuntarily bringing him closer to the awaiting death eaters stupefy ron watched as the death eater fell to the floor as he turned back to his cousin he caught sight of lupin a death eater had snuck up behind him as he battled and was muttering something rictusempra he screamed a jet of silver light coming from the end of his wand the death eater began laughing a high pitched girlish laugh and clutched her side she sunk to her knees and dropped her wand lupin who had finally managed to stun his opponent spun around thanks he yelled ron ian said sounding scared panicked and slightly annoyed help me out here finite he said dismissively ian legs stopped moving and he stumbled forward slightly before steadying himself get going i staying i want to fight ian yelled stubbornly you re going to get killed and he stopped seeing that someone in black robes was running toward ian from behind him incarcerous the death eater stumbled his legs now bound together by invisible rope and he fell diffinido a male death eater muttered the one who had been bound by ropes was released and got to his feet again he gripped his wand and yelled stupefy red sparks shot out at ron protego said ron putting up a shield he couldntbelieve that this was happening he was taking on death eaters left and right without harry around and he was actually doing okay he was vaguely aware of ian running away to safety as he fired another spell protego one death eater said deflecting the curse quit wasting your time with him another one passing ron yelled get potter while they get the girl immediately the death eaters turned around and ran away ron heart nearly stopped they were all going to find harry so they could all fight him at the same time would harry be okay where was his sister what about hermione was she hurt was she the girl they were going to get at this thought anger bubbled inside of him and he gripped his wand stupefy stupefy he chased after them stunning several as he passed it seemed like for every person in that backyard there were five death eaters incendio the robes of a death eater caught on fire and when he stopped running to put the flames out ron stunned him he ran over to where harry was fighting through a mess of black robed death eaters he could see bright red hair bill and charlie were beside harry and mr weasley was there too the twins were hexing every death eater they could reach giving a valiant attempt to join in the fight ron heard someone yelling weasley let get the bloody hell out of here ron turned and found that the voice belonged to none other than the minister of magic that bastard thought ron what good was a minister of magic someone who was supposed to protect the wizarding world from danger if he was trying to flee from battle there were death eaters all over the place attacking and all scrimgeour cared about was getting as far away as possible ron was sure he wasnteven in a rush to get back so he could alert some aurors and have them go help he just wanted to leave so he wouldntbe killed percy was beside scrimgeour but something seemed odd scrimgeour was gripping his arm but percy appeared to be fighting him let go of me sir weasley scrimgeour bellowed what re you doing percy wrenched himself away from the minister and stared at him for a moment if you go you re out of the ministry he threatened percy squared his jaw and turned hurrying toward the circle without a second thought scrimgeour disapparated ginny was nowhere to be seen that was all harry knew he was being attacked by death eaters all of which were shooting hexes and jinxes and unforgivables at him and he countered them he fought them off he avoided them but his mind wasntreally there ginny was gone crucio harry ducked behind a table which received the blast and was blown to pieces he held his wand tightly and looked around he couldntfind ginny anywhere he didntknow if that was a good thing or a very very bad thing reducto bellowed harry a few of the death eaters scurried behind the archway which had been used to the wedding and it met the same fate as the table everything around him seemed to be in ruins tables and chairs were in several pieces as well as the altar harry felt certain this was not how fleur had imagined her wedding day incen stupefy someone yelled the death eater who had been pointing his wand at harry collapsed bill was standing behind him panting slightly he nodded at harry and fired a series of jinxes at another band of death eaters harry heard a noise behind him and spun around just in time to see a person cloaked in black robes point a wand at harry and say imperio any thought that had been running through his mind any worry or doubt that plagued him was instantly gone harry nearly forgot where he was and although he could see the turmoil going on around him he did not care about it i should care he saw mrs weasley she was struggling to fight off two death eaters all by herself that isntright something inside of him stirred even though there was a voice in his mind coaxing him telling him he didntcare and didntneed to fight i need to fight you donthave to fight the voice was telling him but it what i do she screamed for help harry could hear her shrieks over the madness over the slight ringing that was in his ears for a brief terrifying moment harry could hear his own mother cries he could hear her pleading with voldemort pleading not to kill harry he could see that bright flash of green light in his mind he wouldntlet it happen again i have to harry had felt like this before he felt relieved of all care but there was an intruder in his mind and it was extremely disturbing he wasntsupposed to feel like this feeling like this was bad he didntknow why but he remembered that much it good the intruder voice said you dontneed to worry it not good i need to you dontneed to do anything i need to fight i need to help them you dontcare about the fight you dontneed to fight i need to help ginny the other voice disappeared from his head and harry snapped out of his trancelike state conjunctiva he said pointing his wand at the death eater the death eater cast several spells all of which missed harry by a mile the conjunctivitis curse was working apparently because harry opponent could no longer see what was happening stupefy harry bellowed taking advantage of the moment another death eater ran toward him wand raised stupe protego harry wished he had tried harder in class last year maybe if he d mastered non verbal spells he d be able to fight and defend himself better when harry looked back at mrs weasley he was relieved to see that kingsley shacklebolt was taking care of one of the death eaters for her reducto yelled charlie who was fighting to harry right stupefy mr weasley said from harry left incarcerous suddenly they were surrounded the twins were helping and harry was so shocked that he nearly stopped fighting percy had joined in too locomotor mortis cruc stupefy ennervate silencio everywhere harry looked there was a battle ian dad was dueling with a large death eater fleur father was up against two mason was standing in front of a frail looking woman blocking her from the oncoming spells and throwing out a few of his own this was madness it wasntgoing to end harry felt a somewhat familiar tingling in the pit of his stomach and it spread throughout his body his fingers itched and his head felt clear and hazy at the same time death eaters were attacking in the backyard of the burrow the place harry felt the safest after hogwarts voldemort was probably going to show up soon the dementors were more than likely on their way he could feel the pressure building building up in his wrists his palms his fingertips he closed his eyes he could still see he couldntsee faces but he could see colours and he knew where everyone was and what was happening it was almost better almost easier this way it was simplistic and yet almost unfathomable people were going to die the feeling was getting stronger the intense heat was growing and growing and he felt like he was going to burst at any moment oh percy he heard mrs weasley cry percy no percy this was his fault his scar burned and his insides were on fire it had never felt like this before it had never been this strong before this was because of him he needed to scream he needed to cry he had to do something to release this ache inside something was there something was about to happen but he couldntmake it happen he wasntstrong enough yet he didntthink he d ever be strong enough something was going to happen to ron to hermione to ginny something inside of him snapped and he felt every muscle and nerve in his body tense for a moment then the tension was slipping away leaving his body it was draining out of him there was a loud ringing in his ears overpowering the sounds of battle it took him a moment before he could open his eyes again and when he did he felt dizzy and suddenly weak we ve given them enough time a death eater wheezed harry looked around and saw quite a few death eaters on the ground most of them got up and then apparated away a few were left passed out or bound by ropes and other spells percy was lying flat on his back mrs weasley leaning over him ron rushed over to harry his eyes wide and his face reflecting the fear harry felt bubbling inside you did it again how did but harry wasntlistening he thought about the death eaters about the attacks given who enough time something clicked c mon he whispered taking off he ran full speed in the direction ginny and hermione had gone before everything blew up he wasntsure if ron was behind him or if he was still standing there in shock he didntcare harry came to the pond and stopped dead in his tracks hermione was on the ground passed out what had they done to her he heard ron curse loudly and knew for certain that his friend had followed they rushed over to her and ron got to his knees hermione can you hear me she didntrespond he stood up bloody hell whoever did this might still be around here somewhere i going to kill them he marched into the trees and looked around they re gone ron harry said evenly ennervate he muttered hermione hermione began to stir where ginny ron rushed out of the woods and hermione sat up oh she whispered looking around they oh harry they took her what ron demanded who did hermione sniffed snape and harry insides clenched and he gritted his teeth ginny was gone snape had taken her why what did they need with ginny wouldntthey have wanted to take hermione or ron instead why not just go after harry and get it over with this was the final straw there was no more playing around anymore wait here where are you going asked hermione wait here harry repeated harry cried hermione where are you going i going to find ginny he said simply and then i going to find snape so i can murder him harry yelled hermione but it was of no use harry was gone where d you think he gone asked ron hermione shook her head i i dontknow she got up and ron rushed to her side i fine she said ron gave her a strange look and shook his head okay i not fine but i not hurt let get back to your house is everyone okay there are you sure you re okay ron asked putting his arm around her and helping her walk yes she said firmly but didntrefuse his assistance i hope ginny she ll be okay ron insisted sounding only slightly doubtful harry harry will get her back when they got back to the burrow tonks was levitating percy into the house and mrs weasley was following closely behind sobbing hermione chest constricted if she had just kept her wand with her she could ve defended herself and ginny and none of this would have happened fleur was holding bill tightly and he was whispering in her ear trying to calm her is percy okay ron asked when he and hermione ran into the house after them he was hit with a few stunners said a witch hermione didntrecognize but he young if we let him rest he should be okay by later on tonight how how could this have h happened cried mrs weasley why would hermione oh dear are you alright did she look that rough yes i okay mrs weasley but but she couldntsay it how could she tell mrs weasley that her daughter was taken ginny gone ron whispered and harry went after her mrs weasley began sobbing again and mr weasley put his arms around her bill charlie and the twins stiffened i didnthave my wand hermione told them shaking her head and leaning against ron this was her fault they were going to hate her for not defending ginny for not being able to save her they were going to ask her to leave and never come back neither did ginny we couldntfight them i so sorry really i they didnthurt you did they lupin asked hermione shook her head what about ginny is she mr weasley voice cracked and he let his question trail off they didntdo anything to her when they attacked said hermione i dontknow why they wanted her we have to go find ginny fred declared we need to wait until harry gets back tonks said calmly harry went off to find her cried hermione dontyou get it he might not come back regardless lupin said seriously we cantgo rushing out after him we dontknow where he or ginny are we have to stay here no matter how badly they all wanted to ignore them everyone knew that lupin and tonks were right they couldnt do anything not without possibly ending up dead they couldnthelp ginny if they were dead and mrs weasley would lose it if another one of her kids was out there in danger ron looked around where is everyone they ve all apparated far away from here muttered george is heather okay asked ron yeah said fred she wanted to see you but her mum made her go home she wanted to see ron who was she did you really save her charlie asked ron shrugged i i guess that so bloody sick tonks said disgustedly attempting to kill an innocent defenseless little girl like that heather is ian sister ron explained looking down at hermione she only ten bill said sounding disgusted and a death eater would ve killed her if ron hadntstopped him a death eater was prepared to kill a ten year old girl ron had saved her merlin what had gone on while hermione and ginny were at the pond the dark mark wasntover the burrow hermione realized thankfully nobody had been killed yet ginny could be a casualty hermione should be checked out by a healer said mr weasley hermione didntwant to leave she didntwant ron to let go of her it okay she said quickly mr weasley gave her a strange look honestly mr weasley that isntnecessary nothing happened to me at all she didnttell him that she had been stunned surprisingly neither did ron he just held her tightly and didntlet go until harry came back harry looked around one of the frames in his glasses had been broken making it blurry and nearly impossible for him to see out of his left eye but even so he could tell that he was in hogsmeade how he had managed to apparate there without splinching himself he d never know but he had more important things to worry about he weaved in and out of the crowd making his way toward hogwarts he was running full force his legs were burning and he had a stitch in his side but he paid his body no attention he pulled out his wand and magically unlocked the gates entering the grounds of hogwarts he passed hagrid hut and the quidditch pitch and finally he came to the castle he gave himself no time to think back to the night dumbledore was killed he did not bother looking up at the sky so to remember the sight of the dark mark hovering above his beloved school he ran threw the doors and was suddenly very aware that he had no idea where mcgonagall would be would she be in dumbledore office or perhaps her old one he took off down a corridor and up the stairs prepared to run through the entire bloody castle if need be professor mcgonagall he yelled professor potter harry spun around and found professor mcgonagall staring at him as if he had two heads p professor he panted resting his hands on his knees and trying to catch his breath why are you here it it ginny he said breathlessly they took her and who took her mcgonagall asked the the death eaters he wheezed and i need to go after her but you have to you have to help me he inhaled huge gulps of air but nothing was working he couldntbreathe but ginny needed him he would breathe later let go to my office she said calmly we can discuss this there there no time there is there isntany bloody time either we get her now or we never do professor mcgonagall frowned but said nothing she turned around and began walking in the direction of her old office harry stared at her for a moment and felt his blood boil ginny could be dying and mcgonagall wanted to go up to her office and have a nice little tea party are you are you kidding me he asked reluctantly following her and still panting heavily we have to take action we cannot do anything yet mcgonagall said over her shoulder not slowing her strides first we will need to call an emergency order meeting and no harry yelled that will take too long i in charge you ve said it yourself and i going to make the decisions mcgonagall shook her head i am aware of your relationship with miss weasley but that not what this is about exclaimed harry it didntmatter that he was involved with her if it had been ron or hermione he d be acting in exactly the same way someone had been taken by death eaters and it didntmatter if it was ginny or a stranger they would still need rescuing they would still needed help and harry wasntabout to deny anyone that precisely said mcgonagall turning around to stare at him and that is why your personal feelings should be left out of this harry glared at her how could she be acting so calmly did he not explain the situation correctly did she not understand that death eaters had taken ginny and were doing who knows what to her they re going to torture her if we dontdo something soon he trailed off not wanting to think about the end of that sentence we need to go we we need to get her back mcgonagall sighed we dontknow where she is we cannot go blindly running into danger it is not safe i going it my fault she been taken and i ll get her back even if i have to do it alone harry said defiantly you may have been put in charge of the horcrux missions mcgonagall said sternly but that is the extent of your power i forbid you to make another move without my permission and if i do then you will be kicked out of the order she watched harry expectantly challenging him to disobey her direct order then it a good thing that i care more about ginny than i do your bloody order he said bluntly potter you may fancy this girl but i love her and i am not going to stand around while those bastards hurt her he thought he saw the makings of a smile form on her face before she looked down and coughed i sorry but i have no choice but to remove you from the order harry shrugged not feeling even the slightest pang of remorse that fine mcgonagall cleared her throat you re still going after her arentyou she asked softly i have to said harry she nodded very well she said i can understand your concern but if you are going to try and save miss weasley there can be no room for error harry nodded what was she going to say next let go where are we going professor we are going back to the burrow i quite certain there are more than a few people worried about you over there harry sighed and shifted anxiously on his feet he could either go with her or he could stand around arguing for another ten minutes ten minutes that ginny might not have to spare okay he agreed we have to hurry though we will the response i got for the last chapter was huge and completely insane thanks to all those who read those who reviewed and those who didntcome murder me in my sleep though you wanted to disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter sixteen stuck harry was back and he had professor mcgonagall with him the kitchen which had once contained a rather large group of people now held only ron hermione bill charlie fred george mr and mrs weasley lupin tonks kingsley and moody percy was in another room still unconscious bill had convinced fleur to floo back to her parents house and be with her family for a while whilst everything was sorted out the woman who tended to percy had left after giving him a potion and giving mrs weasley instructions on what to do if he didntwake up soon other wedding guests who had been hiding during the attack and ha appeared randomly into the kitchen during the past forty minutes had left as quickly as they could is everyone okay mcgonagall asked looking around the room they all murmured a yes but ron found that he could only nod death eaters had taken his sister they had come very close to taking hermione why had this happened it was bill wedding it was supposed to be a day of fun and family and togetherness and now ginny was gone quite a few people were sporting injuries from the duel with the death eaters and ron couldntdo anything about it he had never felt so helpless in his life he couldntsave his own sister this wasntlike his second year when she was pulled into the chamber of secrets he had no idea where she was or even why she had been taken why her why didntthey try to take hermione who had been with ginny or someone else at the wedding harry was there out in the open but they didnteven attempt to capture him why specifically did they want ginny we have to get to grimmauld place harry said quickly his eyes met ron and ron saw something in his friend eyes that shocked him fear harry had faced voldemort dementors death eaters countless obstacles in the triwizard tournament the deaths of both sirius and dumbledore the search for horcruxes and many other things and he had never been anything short of magnificent he had always been brave and strong but now standing in the kitchen of the burrow with a few cuts and broken glasses he looked terrified i leaving as soon as possible and if any of you want to come along you ll need to be organized nobody protested instead they all scrambled toward the fireplace about to floo to headquarters and set up a rescue mission for ginny wait hermione said my parents are supposed to be arriving soon do you think they ll be okay i ll stay behind someone should stay with p percy anyway said mrs weasley when your parents arrive hermione i ll have them join you at headquarters okay molly dear said mr weasley he for once did not appear excited at the prospect of being with muggles in fact he wore an expression similar to harry s very well said mcgonagall the rest of you let move we have a lot of work to do they arrived to the cold empty grimmauld place and harry immediately began grilling hermione what happened he asked eagerly ron stayed by her side as his dad bill charlie fred george mcgonagall kingsley lupin tonks moody and harry all surrounded her who took her was it just snape or lucius malfoy hermione said quietly was there anyone else bellatrix lestrange was there too said hermione she well she was awful ron blood boiled and he silently vowed to murder that woman she deserved death almost as much as voldemort did ron shuddered at the idea of bellatrix lestrange cornering hermione and his sister at their pond and forced himself to listen to the conversation that was still going on around him why would they take ginny bill demanded yeah said charlie i mean no offense hermione but you were there as well they could ve taken both of you but they didn t there has to be a reason hermione nodded have you been using your occlumency potter asked mcgonagall harry appeared puzzled for a moment before his eyes widened and he cursed no dumbledore said that voldemort was blocking me out so i didntthink he cursed again and slammed his fist against the wall he must have gone poking around in my head when i wasntaware of it why does that matter asked charlie well said hermione harry and ginny um dated briefly at hogwarts ron would ve been amused at the glances that his uneducated brothers cast at harry if they had been under different circumstances but as it was every second was precious and there was no excuse for wasting time they had a crisis to deal with and voldemort stopped blocking me out long enough to figure out that she what i care about most harry growled that son of a is there any other possible explanation kingsley asked no harry said angrily i a bloody idiot and because of me because of my carelessness ginny going to get ginny not going to get anything ron said firmly he didntwant to hear the end of harry sentence if he gave himself time to think about it ron was sure the many different scenarios would drive him mad were they going to kill his sister why else did you know who take prisoners it certainly wasntto have nice little tea parties with them and it isntyour fault hermione told him the entire school knew about you and ginny snape probably heard about it and passed the information along to voldemort what happened when they took her asked harry ignoring hermione attempts to relieve him from the responsibility of putting ginny in danger i hermione closed her eyes as if trying to remember exactly what happened and ron was tempted to tell her it was okay if she didntwant to talk about it she had just been through a traumatic experience and reliving it probably wasntthe best idea but they needed information and if that meant hermione had to recount her story she would have to do it they needed details in order to get to ginny think harry prodded she trying ron snapped harry was stressed ron understood that he was stressed too ginny was his sister and he was dying to get out there and rescue her but he wasntsnapping at everyone especially hermione who had already been through enough when they got there lestrange made a comment about about killing us both hermione said her eyes still closed then she tried to use the cruciatus curse on me but snape and malfoy kept reminding her that they were only supposed to take ginny away and do nothing else they said they had to follow voldemort orders why would they want ginny ron asked why would you know who orders be to take her harry slumped against the wall and cursed yet again why do you think ron they took her because voldemort figured i d come after her voldemort tapped into my mind and he knew that if he wanted to lure me out into the open taking ginny would be his best bet he looked at mcgonagall and nodded and he was right i going you dont i dontknow where to go said harry so you ve all said but this is voldemort we re talking about i dontneed to go anywhere he ll find me himself harry said lupin dontdo anything you ll regret later i wontregret going after her argued harry lupin held up his hands i never said you would he said but you wontbe able to save her just yet we need to organize give us a little time to think please if you rush out you ll only end up getting hurt that canthelp ginny at all ron had never seen his friend appear so torn harry wanted to go off and fight it was what he did harry would go looking for trouble before it had the chance to find him as long as ron had known him harry had never been one to sit on the sidelines he was always in the middle of everything fighting and living dangerously head deep in trouble but even though this was all very true and though ron didntlike to admit it to himself harry also cared a great deal about ginny harry had broken up with her at dumbledore funeral yes but that didntmean he didntcare if anything that showed just how much he cared if ron had been in his situation he wouldnthave been able to do it actually having hermione and intentionally ending things with her would be unthinkable even if it was for her own safety but in the end it hadntbenefited ginny she was still a bigger target than even ron or hermione it seemed i i know but no buts harry mr weasley said stiffly we all want to run out and get her but it would be a huge risk to try anything now order members mcgonagall said breaking the thick silence that had fallen over the room follow me we need to plan a rescue mission when harry did not move ron gave him a strange look but said nothing everyone quickly filed out of the room leaving ron harry and hermione alone in all the years ron had known harry and hermione after everything they had been through together ron had never been more uncomfortable around them than he was right now this even topped the first time he met harry when he was so star struck that he had no idea what to say or do even when he and hermione werentspeaking because of one stupid fight or another there had been less tension than there was now what taking them so long harry demanded as he paced around the room the past five minutes had been the longest of hermione life the sounds of harry feet against the floor and the ticking of the clock overhead were slowly driving her insane the creaking of ron chair as he shifted positions and the tapping of his foot as he impatiently waited for the order members to return to the kitchen made her wish for the deafening silence to return the one that had made her uncomfortable but would now only make her calm and able to think more rationally than she was currently able to calm down hermione said softly harry had never been good at waiting at not being in the middle of action and hermione knew that in fact his tendency to jump the gun had been quite a detriment in the past at the department of mysteries specifically that was exactly why it was important for harry to keep his emotions in check if he was to grow too impatient too angry too worried hermione didntwant to think about what the repercussions would be for ginny if no one else but it was good in some strange horrible way that ginny was the one who had been taken hermione knew that harry loved her and ron but it was ginny who meant the most to him and he would take extra caution in rescuing her on the flip side however it made him extra anxious to get out there and attempt a rescue mission hermione knew it wouldntbe long before his control snapped i cantjust calm down snapped harry what do you want me to do hermione pretend that ginny gone off to a friend house and will be back in the morning do you want me to act like everything is fine and dandy and that it isntmy fault that she might be it isnt you fault cried hermione unable to keep her own emotions in check any longer bullocks harry muttered beside hermione ron sighed heavily bloody hell would you shut up ginny gone but sitting here snapping at your friends isntgoing to get her back and hermione right it isntyou fault why do you always have to shoulder the burden for every bloody thing that happens he asked his voice loud and firm merlin you broke up with her because you thought it would keep her safe you did all you could no i didn t yelled harry his face was going red and hermione didntlike the look in his eyes one bit this was going to be trouble she was sure of it i didntdo anything other than break up with her and then fool around with her behind everyone backs and do you know why ron because i a git and it should have been me not her not her never her ron stood up his face suddenly red and hermione had to think for a moment before connecting the dots on what harry had just said you did what with my sister now it was ron turn to be told to calm down how could you do that ron demanded taking a step toward him you said you cared about her and you still went ahead and turned her into your own personal slag shut up ron hermione hissed i know that you must be surprised to find out but this isntthe time ron whirled around to face her and gave her a curious look you knew ron asked staring incredulously at hermione you knew what he was doing to my sister and you didnttell me hermione didntknow what to say she had inadvertently admitted to knowing that harry and ginny had been sneaking around and ron was going to hate her now she had never seen ron look angrier than he did at that moment cursing he balled up his hands and after sharply pulling back his right arm connected his fist with harry jaw harry head jerked to the side and he stumbled back but didntretaliate ron punched him again stop it yelled hermione stop hitting him ron ignored her and hit him again harry stumbled against the wall and ron stopped harry didnteven seem fazed hermione wasnteven sure he knew he d just been hit his eyes were glazed over and he dropped his gaze to the floor ignoring ron completely damn it fight back growled ron his face was bright red and he was gritting his teeth he needed to let out his emotions through physical aggression a request hermione was thankful to see harry wasntcomplying to harry shook his head but said nothing hermione felt tears sting her eyes as she watched her friend she was i thought we could hide it i thought nobody would know but oh harry no said hermione there nobody to blame but me he said he looked at ron intently i have to go i cantstay here any longer i i need to go she my sister cried ron she my sister i want to go after her more than anything else but it would be a suicide mission and you know that i dontbloody care harry bellowed dontyou get it they re going to hurt her they re going to torture her they they re going to use the cruciatus curse on her ron paled yeah you think that bad do you have you ever had it used on you ron shook his head slowly he looked frightened beyond his wits like a small child your whole body feels like it on fire explained harry his voice low and dangerous and you cantsee anything because you re blinded by the pain and you canthear anything but your own screams and it just keeps burning and you just keep screaming it feels like it feels like everything bad and evil in the world intensified by about a billion percent it isntlike the imperius either you cantthrow off the cruciatus you get to the point that you pray for death because nothing is worse than the pain hermione shivered she d read about the curse and its effects she d even seen it used on a spider by barty crouch jr when he impersonated moody but she d never heard someone who d been subjected to it actually talk about it she d never heard harry describe it before she d practically forgotten he d experienced it they they wontreally do that to her w will they she asked harry turned to regard her his stare cold and worried they might if we give them the chance he said seriously that why i have to find her now you can t you ll get yourself killed you donthave a plan this isnta game harry you need to know what you re getting yourself into hermione right agreed ron this is one thing we need to let the order members take charge of i dontwant to sit around here any more than you do but there nothing else we can do right now yes there is harry protested he winced and lightly rubbed his jaw which was already swelling ron looked down and mumbled an apology harry shrugged and hermione noticed his eyes were sparkling with determination and a sort of recklessness there something i can do something i need to do and it the only way to get her back i doing it what questioned hermione it obvious as to why they took ginny wouldntyou agree hermione shrugged and ron gave a strange head movement they didntwant to point fingers but it was rather obvious that they took her because of harry they took her because they knew that i d come for her and they want me to they wontkill her if they need her isntthat a good thing asked ron in some ways no harry said he looked like it pained him to say the words but he knew them to be true they ll torture her until they can get her to talk they want her alive but that doesntmean they wonthave a little fun with her they want information about me about the horcruxes about everything and i know ginny she wont talk they ll keep cursing her until until she like the longbottoms ron gasped and hermione felt hot tears roll down her cheeks again unless i act quickly i can still save her there still some time we re coming with you hermione said instantly it seemed like the logical response she and ron always followed harry whether it was to go after the philosopher stone or to the department of mysteries to potentially rescue sirius they were always there by his side hadntthey agreed at dumbledore funeral that they d be with him every step of the way rushing out to get ginny actually didntsound too bad in fact it seemed exactly like something the three of them would do the adults were still in the order meeting they could slip away and nobody would even notice harry shook his head and narrowed his eyes she suddenly knew better than to argue no you re not it too dangerous and she my sister ron yelled for the millionth time i coming with you whether you like it or not you cantstop me she there because of me shouted harry nobody said anything for a moment hermione couldnthelp but notice that neither she nor ron disagreed though she was sure it wasntintentional she was too shocked by everything that happened to be able to think rationally it was easy to imagine going out finding ginny and bringing her back safe in hermione mind they encountered no obstacles no troubles everyone made it through just as they had in the past but this wasntthe same as it was in their first year when they stopped the troll or faced the three headed dog one wrong move and ginny would die harry paced the room what are you saying hermione asked worriedly i saying that the death eaters took her and they re going to hurt her i i donteven want to think about what they might do get on with it ron said impatiently you re family is suffering because of me harry they re only using her to lure me in to draw me out so voldemort can have me she in danger because they want me i ll give them what they want i ll give them a trade they give us ginny and i ll surrender myself harry would surrender himself if there had been a doubt in hermione mind that harry loved ginny it was squashed by his last statement harry was willing to sacrifice himself for ginny and while hermione as fairly certain that he d be noble and do that for just about anyone there was a look in his eyes that told her he not only felt he had to do it but that he wanted to as well harry was dead serious about this donteven think about it shrieked hermione you cantdo that they ll kill you voldemort will kill you dumbledore once told me that one of voldemort weaknesses is his fear of death voldemort believes that there nothing worse than death but he wrong worse than death what does that mean what could be worse asked ron watching everyone that you love die said harry living all the while knowing that everyone you care about died because of you died to help you that worse harry turned to hermione you have to think i need to know did snape say anything else no said hermione she thought back to the fiasco at the pond and remembered something but right when ginny got taken she said casting a worried glance at ron she said to tell you that um she harry slammed his fist on the table and she stopped knowing that he understood what she was about to say ginny loved him the silencing charm had prevented ginny from actually giving her the full message but she would bet her life that was what ginny had intended to say professor harry yelled mcgonagall rushed into the kitchen an instant later we re doing all we can potter she said wearily well it not enough he argued we have to do something now i going he pulled his wand from his pocket and stepped around ron you cantdo that lupin said softly appearing behind mcgonagall what else happened harry asked hermione did any of the death eaters say anything else important hermione thought back i no she said but malfoy gave me a message to give to you he said that he and his son are looking forward to seeing you soon harry furrowed his brow and bit his lip after a moment he cursed loudly and turned back to mcgonagall that bloody bastard i know where they are where they re at the malfoy place disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter seventeen the fear malfoy manor asked mcgonagall why would they be there asked ron why else would lucius malfoy want hermione to tell me that he and his son are looking forward to seeing me soon it makes sense said harry it explains why he didntwant anyone to hurt hermione too they needed to make sure i got the message but hermione said furrowing her brow it does make sense is there any spell that we could do you know harry said to know for certain if she there ron cleared his throat cantyou use your your wandless magic or something he asked mcgonagall narrowed her eyes at harry wandless magic what is he talking about she demanded i er it happened once harry justified when we went to romania i sort of did something with my hands but it was nothing really that not true said ron it wasnt nothing it was wicked you did it more than once when we were in romania y know and you did it in the backyard when the death eaters attacked harry eyes widened he had done it in the backyard he didnteven know why didnthe know when he was doing it he couldntfigure it out but now that he thought about it he did remember feeling a bit strange at the time he had assumed it was because he had just thrown off the imperius curse this was bloody confusing why couldnthe control it it was hardly an asset if he couldnteven manage his new power mcgonagall folded her arms and gave him a stern look why was i not informed of this harry shot hermione a desperate look hoping she d come up with a brilliant excuse as she always did she shrugged and looked at ron who also shrugged we will discuss this later potter harry nodded yes professor he said he looked around the room again but is there anything we can do kingsley nodded absentmindedly there is one spell that aurors are taught it called the wandering spell it effective but perhaps it isntappropriate for this situation there is a chance that it doesntmatter harry urged if there a chance that we can find ginny by doing the spell we have to do it kingsley and mcgonagall exchanged looks minerva asked kingsley what do you think mcgonagall cleared her throat and nodded i think it is our duty to do all we can to retrieve miss weasley but who will do it asked tonks it highly dangerous harry wanted to volunteer himself but he knew that professor mcgonagall wouldntallow him to she wouldnttrust him especially after he hadnttold her about the wandless magic but really was it that big of a deal he had no bloody idea what the spell would do but it didntreally matter this was ginny harry was beginning to think that there wasnt anything he wouldntdo to save her especially since this was his fault he had done this to her after all they were taking ginny to use her as bait for harry ginny by herself held no allure for the death eaters what drew them to her was the fact that harry cared about her the fact that she was his greatest weakness they wouldntlet her die not yet anyway they needed her too much and if they could get there in time well maybe nothing bad would have to happen to her at all harry chest constricted when he imagined ginny being tortured a part of him wished she would have the sense to cooperate wished she would tell them whatever they asked his safety be damned what exactly would they do to her surely they wouldnt no he wouldntlet himself think about that they wouldn t it was too disgusting to even think about they wouldntdo it to her he would never let them she was a blood traitor a mudblood lover in their eyes they wouldnttouch her would they she was shockingly beautiful and death eaters werentexactly upstanding people they d do that to her if they were ordered to if they thought it would make her crack if it had been hermione who had been captured harry wouldnthave to worry no matter how pretty she was she was considered impure but ginny ginny was a pureblood when you got right down to it it was a possibility so why were they all standing around why hadntsomeone volunteered to do the spell already they had to get to her soon every second was precious especially now that the idea of that was in harry mind potter should do it mcgonagall said after a moment harry jumped slightly at the mention of his name having been wrapped up in his thoughts that is if he feels he is capable i more than capable harry said instantly though he still had no clue of what he would have to do what will he have to do professor hermione asked as if reading his thoughts mcgonagall took a deep breath the spell is not a very common one it is normally used under different circumstances but it is our only option i am afraid it can be highly dangerous if not performed correctly also there are a few very important things that must be taken into consideration before just then mrs weasley along with mr and mrs granger both looking exceptionally frazzled and percy came through the fireplace mrs weasley eyes swept over everyone and came to rest on harry she stared at him for a moment hermione parents went over to her and her mother was about to wrap her in a hug when mrs weasley spoke oh harry what happened mrs weasley cried harry stared at her for a moment having no idea what she was talking about what was wrong with him he opened his mouth to reply and felt a flare of pain shoot through his jaw oh right ron had hit him not that he hadntdeserved it or anything his eyes must have traveled over to ron who was now staring pointedly at his shoes because mrs weasley gasped and planted her hands on her hips ronald weasley did you do this to him what were you thinking hermione parents finally exchanged a proper hello with their daughter all the while watching everyone with nervous eyes do you see the type of environment she been surrounded by harry heard hermione mum muttered to her father i was under the impression that she would be kept safe here he frowned and hoped that the grangers didntthink the weasleys were a bunch of barbarians did they think that the burrow was a hostile environment the reason they were even here at grimmauld place was because hermione had been mysteriously injured while staying at the burrow and they wanted to bring her back to the muggle world ron glanced up at mrs weasley mum i let get on with this harry said suddenly the spell professor how is it done what is it it is a wandering spell mcgonagall said my knowledge on this particular enchantment is limited she looked expectantly at kingsley perhaps you would be willing to explain it kingsley nodded well tonks wasntlying when she said this would be dangerous the history of the wandering spell is rather complicated you the wanderer will be put under a sort of self induced trance he explained it called a wandering spell for a reason harry your mind will leave you body and send you to wherever you choose malfoy manor in this case while your body rests here safe and sound it is not nearly as easy as it sounds however while you re wandering you must be extremely careful it still a possibility that you can be detected though you wont physically be there unfortunately i canttell you anything about how it feels because i have never been under the spell the reactions have been known to vary he said thoughtfully although harry didntparticularly like the way kingsley said that he forced it from his mind and nodded okay he said when can we do it you what asked mrs weasley malfoy manor we think ginny there bill told his mum lucius malfoy gave hermione a message and all the clues point to malfoy manor as where she was taken to harry sighed as ron jumped in and began to bring mrs weasley up to speed honestly couldntthey wait until after ginny had been rescued he caught professor mcgonagall eye and a silent understanding passed through them they took a few steps away from the group of people who were too busy talking or listening to notice that harry and mcgonagall had slipped away for a moment professor harry said quietly i dont i need to know what i might find when i do this what do you mean i the spell it ll bring me to malfoy manor right he asked mcgonagall nodded so i ll see if they re if something is happening to her are you asking me if i think the death eaters will be torturing her no i already know that they might do that i asking if if you think mcgonagall looked at him expectantly rape he blurted out making sure to keep his voice low so the weasleys wouldnthear him would they i mean would ginny i do not think that is a top priority just yet mcgonagall said firmly harry breathed a sigh of relief though the words just yet were not lost on him okay he said watching the weasleys he didntthink he could stand it much longer not having ginny with him by his side safe it physically pained him to think about what must be happening to her was she alone and scared or worse was lestrange with her maybe even malfoy harry wondered if snape would be there if he would sneer at her in triumph before raising his wand and cursing her he vowed to himself that if given the chance he would kill snape once ginny was out of danger that is are you sure you want to do this asked mcgonagall there is a great amount of danger involved yeah i know i sure he said i know that you are anxious to retrieve miss weasley but one of our aurors would be more than qualified to do the spell themselves forgive me but they are more well expendable than you are harry knew what she meant she meant that it didntreally matter in the grand scheme of things if an auror was killed aurors were killed everyday but if harry potter died trying to save ginny there would be an uproar everyone would be doomed because voldemort wouldntbe stopped this bothered harry on so many different levels that he didnteven know how to reply to professor mcgonagall he thought of tonks and kingsley and moody they were aurors were they expendable as mcgonagall had put it they had value they had worth they had just as much reason to live as harry did and yet he was being treated as if he was on a higher level than the rest of wizarding kind and ginny she was important too maybe rescuing ginny didntseem as important to everyone else as killing voldemort did but it was even more important to harry if something happened to ginny that would be it he would have nothing to live for no reason to want to win this war he was going to hunt down the horcruxes and he was going to get rid of voldemort but he wasntdoing it to be a hero or because it was the right thing to do or even because he pretty much didnthave a choice in the matter he was doing it now because he wanted to make the world a good place a safe place for ginny he wanted to make the world beautiful enough for her he wanted to give her everything he could and then some he wanted a house and more kids than they knew what to do with kids with messy red hair and green eyes or maybe even brown eyes yes harry decided brown eyes sounded lovely what i am trying to say mcgonagall said bringing harry back to reality is that you should not do anything drastic there is a lot more riding on this than the fate of miss weasley sorry professor harry said but ginny fate is really all i concerned with right now mcgonagall nodded yes i know that is why i am telling you this you have a tendency of letting your emotions get the best of you potter if we are to have any chance of rescuing miss weasley you will need to be in control of i in control harry said stiffly i certainly hope so for miss weasley sake harry frowned and they rejoined the group preparing what they needed for the wandering spell harry crossed his fingers and hoped they wouldntbe too late when ginny awoke she didntremember where she was at first she didnteven remember passing out as far as she remembered she was at home in bed but there was a slight throbbing in her head and her bed wasntas comfortable as she remembered plus she was so cold it was august it shouldntbe this cold and what was that smell she opened one eye and looked around she wasntin her bedroom she sat up quickly and the past few hours came rushing back to her where was she how long had she been passed out the room was dark and damp and had a disgusting putrid smell to it it was a dungeon lit only by a few candles mounted on the walls she was in a corner her arms and legs invisibly bound together she struggled but couldntbreak free she was stuck terror rose inside of her when she assessed the situation hermione had been stunned at the pond death eaters had attacked the other guests at the wedding now ginny was being held captive here though she didntknow where here was how would anybody find her it could be ages before anyone even realized that she and hermione had left would they know where to look for her would hermione be able to offer them any help once she was revived what if something had happened to hermione or to ginny family was harry okay harry was he worried about her had he even noticed that she was gone did he care of course he cared ginny told herself he loved her he said he did at least why would he lie about that she wished she could go back in time if she could she wouldnthave been so stupid she wouldnthave left her wand in the house and gone gallivanting around away from her family sight during a bloody war what was she thinking she wasnt thinking but who would ve thought that there would be an attack on the burrow during bill wedding she certainly hadn t merlin had it really been a few hours ago that she was standing at the altar watching her brother get married had it really been that morning that she was in bed with harry holding him close and trying to block out hermione who had been trying to wake her it didntfeel like the same day maybe it hadntbeen maybe it had been days weeks even could she have been out for that long there was a loud echoing sound of footsteps and ginny froze she held her breath and her heart starting beating even faster than it already was as bellatrix lestrange came into the dungeon ginny had the sudden urge to vomit lestrange face was twisted into a smug sneer and she kept her wand raised in an almost hesitant way though ginny couldntsee why it wasntas if she could do anything her wand was gone and she wasntpowerful like harry she was completely helpless she was at lestrange mercy this was just like her first year when she had been dragged down into the chamber of secrets what happened to your little family what about potter they arentcoming for you weasley they re going to let you die here no ginny croaked out her throat was dry and her voice cracked she coughed and tried to move but the bindings held her still they re coming why wasntlestrange wearing a mask ginny was terrified of the death eater costume but the look on lestrange face chilled her even more what was going on why had she been taken anyway she was of no value to the death eaters or even voldemort for that matter she wasntsmart like hermione she wasntbrave like ron she didnthave half as much knowledge about harry or the order as they did but oh was that it was it harry was he the reason she had been taken she hoped not for many reasons she didntwant him to feel guilty to feel like if he had only stayed away from her that she could ve been spared even if that was the truth although ginny wasntsure it was she didntwant harry to have that on his conscience if something was to happen to her if she didntmake it out of this predicament she didntwant him to hate himself to blame himself but mostly she didntwant to have to admit that he was right she didntwant him to keep thinking that it was best if they werenttogether if she got out of this if she made it back to the burrow she wanted to be with him she loved him but harry was a noble prat and he would do the right thing which in this case would be distancing himself from her so not to endanger her further they dontknow where you are lestrange taunted do you think potter even cares about you he probably hasnteven noticed that you re gone she laughed you didntmean anything to him you didntmean anything to anyone why was lestrange talking about her in past tense they were going to kill her werentthey did she really have anything to lose then liar ginny whispered what did you call me liar lestrange laughed again a deep echoing sound that sent a chill down ginny spine crucio almost as soon as she had heard lestrange utter the curse ginny felt a sense of pain that she d never known before it didntseem possible to hurt this much hurt that didnteven describe it it was torture absolute misery intensified by a thousand per cent how had harry survived this the curse seemed to go on forever but was actually only a few seconds when it ended ginny ears were ringing and her throat was raw it was then that she realized she had been screaming louder than she d ever thought possible her whole body burned and ached and she was vaguely aware of lestrange talking to her that ought to loosen your tongue tell me about never ginny breathed silly girl dontyou realize that i never going to tell you anything dontinterrupt me crucio for the second time in her short life ginny knew true agony she felt as though she had been lit on fire and thrown off a cliff and hit by a million beaters and stabbed repeatedly all at the same time i suggest you talk i no said ginny her voice was hoarse and she had to struggle to focus her eyes on lestrange face the last thing she needed to do was pass out again she hated herself for not being able to take the pain she hated herself for not being strong like harry harry he would come for her he was looking for her right now he was on his way and he would kill lestrange for ever hurting her he loved her he wouldntabandon her like this harry would be there for her in turn ginny would be there for him she would tell lestrange nothing no matter what that awful woman did to her she hadntlied when she told him she loved him but wait she didnttell him she had meant to she had tried to tell hermione to tell him but she hadntactually told him he didntknow and if she died her feelings would die with her harry would never know that she loved him hadnthe always known she had loved him since she was ten but it was different then it had never felt like this back then ginny knew deep down that she hadntbeen in love with harry at the age of ten she had an all consuming crush on him yes but she hadntloved him she hadnteven known the real him not until the summer before her fourth year when they were all trapped in grimmauld place together she wouldnthave died for him she hadntfelt that until the end of her fourth year at the department of mysteries she wouldnthave been able to withstand torture for him and even though she couldnteven begin to comprehend the hurt she was feeling right now she would gladly take it all if she could help harry in some way even though he had rejected her even though he didntwant to be with her even though the things lestrange said had struck a chord inside of ginny she would do this all for him love wasntabout conditions it was unconditional you shall pay with your life then lestrange said icily so be it said ginny very well said lestrange crucio harry wasntcoming for her this one lasted longer than the previous two and left ginny gasping for breath taking in gulps of air but still feeling as though she needed more her lungs burned and her heart was pounding so fiercely ginny thought it might stop altogether had enough are you ready to talk not even close ginny wheezed feeling a strange new sense of courage i meant it you ll have to kill me you would die to protect potter she asked seemingly irritated it a pity that he wouldntdo the same for you ginny knew that he would but harry would die for a lot of people maybe she wasntspecial maybe she was just another person who needed to be saved by harry perhaps that was why he liked her in the first place he remembered how it felt to save her in the chamber of secrets and knew that it was only a matter of time before he got the opportunity again he liked playing the hero that was all could that be it she was being crazy this was what lestrange wanted her to think lestrange wanted her to be weak but ginny was strong she would fight until her last breath lestrange used the curse again and ginny didntknow if her last breath would be all that far off disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter eighteen the wanderer you re sure that harry will be able to reach her asked percy if anyone has hope of connecting with miss weasley i daresay it would be him mcgonagall said but that is neither here nor there harry is going to malfoy manor regardless of whether she is there or not ron sighed harry and ginny his best mate and his sister were together well no they weren t ron wouldntbe so angry if they were the truth of the matter is that they werent together they werentdating they werentinvolved in any way and yet they were well he didnteven want to think about what they were doing it had been happening right under his nose for weeks all summer he now suspected and hermione had known every time he had said something to her every time he had mentioned that harry and his sister had been acting strangely she would shrug it off and tell him he was only imagining it how could she have done that to him never mind her how could harry have done that to him they were mates best mates and harry had lied to him harry had bloody defiled his sister ron scowled in disgust was this really happening he had looked up to harry he had idolized him the chaser on the chudley cannons was entertaining to watch but hell he flew around on a broom for a living his biggest worry was whether or not a ball would go through a bloody hoop harry fought voldemort and his biggest worry wasnteven whether or not he d live to see tomorrow but if his friends would live to see it in ron eyes harry could pretty much do no wrong but now harry had done a lot wrong when they got ginny back ron was going to sit the two of them down and murder them well maybe he d let ginny get checked out by a healer first and maybe he d make a point to hug her and tell her he loved her but once that was out of the way harry and ginny were in for it can we get started harry asked anxiously this was where things got tricky for ron no matter what had been happening between harry and ginny no matter how vile or disgusting ron imagined it to be harry really did care about ginny anyone who didntsee that would have to be blind or deaf or a complete imbecile in one way or another as mad as ron wanted to be a part of him was almost happy at the panic on his friend face it was that panic that was saving harry from the arse kicking of a lifetime courtesy of ron weasley he sighed again and tried unsuccessfully to listen to mcgonagall and the others ramble on and on about the wandering spell all he could think about was ginny and harry and their slightly messed up relationship the first time he had ever considered harry as a good match for his sister was during his fourth year he and harry had been scrambling for dates at the yule ball and he had suggested that ginny go with harry and afterwards the more he had thought about it the more it seemed like the perfect solution he couldntstand cho chang and the fact that harry was so entranced by her confused him what was so great about her sure she was pretty but a lot of girls were pretty perhaps ron would ve noticed her more if he hadntbeen so busy fretting over hermione that year but that was beside the point he had figured that ginny would be a good match for him they spent their summers together at the burrow and they had always ended up around each other at school so why not what would be so wrong with harry and ginny getting together harry had been his best friend for years and ron knew that he was a good standup guy or ron had thought he was at least he hadntthought that harry would turn his sister into a cheap slag okay so he wasntbeing fair but still it didntlook too good ron hoped that maybe harry hadntreally meant to say what he said or maybe ron had misunderstood yeah that could be it the second time had been at the beginning of his fifth year he had heard that ginny was seeing michael corner and when he confronted her about it she had shrugged and looked away but hadntdenied it what about harry he had asked ginny had sighed and planted her hands on her hips i ve given up on him ron she had said sternly with a brave slightly defiant look in her eyes ron had noted that she hadntsaid that she d gotten over him she had only said that she d given up on him but there had been something about the way she said it perhaps it was the way her voice broke as she told him that struck something inside of him the third time had been near the end of his fifth year when ginny had stood up to harry and demanded that he let her accompany them to the department of mysteries she had yelled at him and called him out the two of them butting heads like two angry hippogriffs he had vaguely thought ginny someone who can keep harry in line and harry looks out for her well enough but then they had mounted the threstrals and flown off to rescue sirius any thoughts of his sister love life leaving his mind the next time had been on the train ride home when he had not so subtly suggested that she choose someone better next time of course ginny had let it slip that she had already chosen dean thomas so ron had backed off but ginny and dean hadntlasted and somehow finally harry had pulled his head out of his arse and managed to see what a wonderful catch ginny was and now i think that all we ll need tonks said ron looked up and saw that the kitchen table had been moved away and a space on the floor had been cleared out are you ready harry harry nodded eagerly and joined her in the middle of the empty space er what do i do he asked just lay down tonks answered harry gave her a strange look but obeyed getting on the floor and staring up at everyone remember said kingsley you are simply doing this spell to find out if ginny is really being held at malfoy manor or not you are not to be detected because there could be dire consequences donttouch anything you will be able to hear us talking to you we can guide you and collect information as you go but you must remember not to speak out directly to us or you will most likely be overheard dontget too close if you can help it you will have a half hour to get in and out that all the time we can give you unfortunately after that the spell will have worn off be smart harry dontdo anything stupid if you do miss weasley will be the one to suffer is there anything else asked harry take your shoes off tonks said quickly ron felt his brow furrow and looked at her quizzically it a precaution kingsley nodded and harry kicked his shoes off are you ready harry looked at ron as kingsley began the spell in that moment ron felt his anger momentarily subside replaced with concern for his sister and for his best friend he held his breath as harry eyes fluttered shut harry was standing in front of a dark looming house made of stone it rivaled hogwarts in size and sent a chill down harry spine this he knew was the house of evil and this was where ginny was he was sure of it he could feel it he had to get her out he climbed the steps and reached out to the door how would he get in if the front door mysteriously opened wouldntsomeone notice wouldntsomeone investigate but as soon as his hand touched the door handle it went through harry jumped back as if he had been burned and brought his hand up to his face to examine it it didntlook any different perhaps slightly more translucent could he walk through things tonks hadntmentioned that biting his lip he took a few steps forward and passed through the stone doors can you hear me harry harry opened his mouth to answer knowing that it was tonks he was hearing but remembered that he wasntsupposed to speak he nodded wondering if his head was nodding on the floor of grimmauld place look around can you see anything he could see a lot of things he could see high ceilings marble floors pillars and long corridors lit only by candlelight he could see shadows lurking in the distance patterns dancing on the walls but none of that mattered he couldntsee ginny and he couldntsee any death eaters is ginny there he heard ron ask can you see her he shook his head and kept walking he caught himself looking over his shoulder keeping a lookout for signs of danger and forced himself to remember that he couldntbe seen it felt awkward to walk around with his invisibility cloak or the marauder map to guide him had he been visible he felt certain he would ve stuck out like a sore thumb malfoy manor was a dreadful place it was cold and hard and unloving harry now understood how someone like draco malfoy could be so evil growing up in a household such as this must have been an awful experience but even so harry felt no sympathy for the youngest malfoy and harry would still extract revenge given the chance a shiver ran through harry body and he looked around half expecting a dementor to be lurking around somewhere the negative feelings centered on this house were overwhelming the air seemed to be charged creating a constant feeling of unease he needed to focus he needed to look around and find ginny she was there he knew she was but there were so many different routes to go and ginny could be at the end of any of these corridors any of these flights of stairs he tried to think of where malfoy would keep his prisoners in the basement in the dungeon that where he stood in silent debate for a moment before choosing a path and hoping it was the right one he heard a scream a bone chilling blood curdling scream ginny scream his heart caught in his throat and despite everything despite the fierce sense of hatred that welled up inside of him despite the overwhelming sense of responsibility of knowing that he had done this to her and wanting to find her to get her back he couldntmove what would he find when he followed the sound of her screams what is it what wrong he couldntanswer didntknow how to answer harry she screamed again and harry snapped out of it he needed to get to her if he didnt the sound was muffled far away and something told harry that he was going the wrong way he turned around and picked a different route torn between wanting her to scream so he could find her and not wanting her to scream because it would mean that she was in pain when no more screams came harry was too relieved to care that he probably wouldntfind her as quickly he now had proof that ginny was here the order members would have to believe him he imagined mcgonagall with her hand on her hip and a stern look on her face telling him that it could ve been anyone who was screaming and they couldntbe certain that it was ginny okay he d need to get more proof he wandered in silence in darkness for a few moments before coming to a stairwell he descended for what felt like ages focusing on keeping one foot in front of the other he could see and hear nothing but something inside was telling him that ginny was this way a voice broke through fifteen minutes left hurry fifteen minutes shite what had he been doing all this time walking around with his head up his arse it seemed because he still hadntgotten any closer to ginny and there were no candles lighting the way anymore there was no way of seeing anything around him he knew logically that wandering around in the dark wasntthe smartest thing in the world but something was calling him drawing him deeper into the darkness he could hear a voice a female but he couldntmake out what she was saying with a shaking hand he reached into his robes and gripped his wand prepared to draw it at any moment if it was bellatrix lestrange wait what was he going to do was he going to hex her kill her like she had killed sirius could he even do it he had no doubt that he could that he would be able to but would the wandering spell allow it he shook his head to clear his mind he wouldntlet himself do anything that would put ginny in danger the voice was getting louder coming up behind him harry knew for certain now that it was lestrange he moved around blindly wondering what would happen if he accidentally bumped into her there was another voice a male one which he didntrecognize harry stayed stock still blanketed in darkness he listened as the voices came up behind him passed him and then ceased lestrange and the man fell into silence a loud screeching sound rang out and harry eyes widened as a door opened ten yards ahead of him illuminating the corridor wands raised lestrange and the other death eater disappeared into the other room while another came out the heavy steel door closed leaving harry in the darkened corridor with the other death eater whose echoing footsteps were retreating going back up the stairs are you ready to talk weasley harry gasped ginny was in there she was right on the other side of the wall was she okay there was a moment of silence before harry head ginny weak reply not even close are you getting anything harry ignored the voices and walked forward colliding roughly with the door there must have been some sort of spell protecting the room because harry couldntget through are you there tonks prodded but harry did not bother to answer he would just have to wait until someone opened the door and he could slip inside bloody hell are you listening is she there or not ron well honestly make him answer us had the situation not have been so dire harry would ve smiled at his friends antics ron and hermione were pathetic in the best way possible he loved them both but merlin they danced around each other in the most annoying way at first he had been worried about what would happen if ron and hermione were to get together now he was worried about what would happen if they didnt harry hadntrealized that he had been waiting for quite some time until he heard tonks tell him you have five minutes harry heart began racing again and he silently screamed demanding that the door open so he could get inside he wondered if he could do wandless magic if he should even bother trying at last there was an echoing sound of laughter followed by another loud screech harry looked up in time to see two figures entering the corridor with agility harry hadntknown he possessed he bolted to the door and slipping in just before it closed bringing him into the room that held ginny it was a huge room and as dungeon like as anything he d ever seen before it reeked of urine and decay and well if pure evil had a smell harry was sure that this was it like the rest of the manor candles that were mounted on the wall acted as the only source of light there were chains in the corner and a bucket of which harry did not want to know its contents the stone walls trapped the cold and harry shivered feeling the coolness of the room in his very soul he took a few steps forward deeper into the dungeon his eyes scanning the corners for ginny she wasntthere damn it how was that possible he had heard her she had to be in there he wondered how many dungeons the malfoy could possibly have surely they only had one but then again harry wouldntput it past lucius malfoy to have a whole underground network of dungeons of torture chambers of rooms devoted to voldemort and the dark arts perhaps she wasnt in there but he had heard lestrange talking to her hadnthe beside his foot however lay a piece of gold material it looked like it had been ripped off ginny dress she d most likely stepped on it and it had torn harry drew his wand from the pocket of his robes on guard his senses attuned to everything around him he wished he had ginny wand on him so maybe he could give her it and she could fight the death eaters off would it help her to have a wand or would the death eaters outnumber her and kill her for complicating their plans what were their plans no matter what was going to happen ginny was going to need her wand to defend herself he would have to remember to grab it when they came back to rescue her a new sense of panic surged inside of harry when he finally spotted her far across the dungeon she was huddled in the corner her head lolled to the side she had never looked smaller than she did at that moment harry had a brief flashback to the chamber of secrets even then she hadntlooked this pale this fragile this broken he studied her chest as he walked closer but didntsee the telltale rising and falling was she breathing yes as he got closer he saw that she was her breathing was weak so weak that harry wasnttruly sure if it was actually happening or if he was simply imagining it but he did not have time to debate with himself because tonks cut in again thirty seconds harry harry sunk to his knees and leaned forward staring at the limp figure in front of him ginny he whispered before he could catch himself he had been ordered not to talk but that had only applied to when others were around right it okay i going to come back for you i going to kill them all for this and in that moment kneeling on the cold stone floor and staring at a near lifeless ginny harry knew that he would there wasntanything he wouldntdo for the girl before him twenty seconds there was a loud echoing sound behind him and harry turned the man who murdered dumbledore entered the dungeon and frowned when he saw ginny hatred arose in harry momentarily cancelled out by confusion a flick of was that worry passed through snape features before it faded replaced by a hard sneer harry stared at his former professor and wondered if it had really even been there at all snape looked directly at harry who felt his blood run cold and his heart hammer furiously against his ribcage he felt certain that he had been sighted before remembering that he couldntpossibly have been snape shook his head and gripped his wand ten seconds get ready ennervate snape said pointing his wand at ginny ginny eyes fluttered open and she gasped stiffening suddenly as she saw snape get away from me she said weakly but harry felt sudden pride bubble up inside when he saw the fierce look her eyes still held quiet weasley snape spat he looked around and waved his hand muttering something under his breath he turned to her again there is no time listen carefully harry opened his eyes and found himself on the hard kitchen floor of grimmauld place disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter nineteen the waiting this was a nightmare it had to be there was no way that hermione was really standing in the middle of grimmauld place with her parents and the weasleys her two families one magical and one muggle watching as harry was put under some type of daze because ginny had been captured by death eaters right outside of the burrow but it was real and hermione loved her parents really but if they didntstop fussing over her and let her focus on harry she was going to snap is ginny the little redhead girl why was she taken asked her mother who took her asked her father and why were you there do you try to be put in dangerous situations hermione mum dad this isntthe time hermione muttered she had known it would be disastrous the moment she saw her parents step out of the fireplace she couldntbelieve that mrs weasley had actually brought them here to headquarters of all places the worst part was that they had heard the updates that the weasley boys were giving mrs weasley they had heard everything about ginny and the death eaters they had heard that hermione had been there when they were attacked hermione eyes wandered to ron who was standing a few feet away and staring at harry who was now under the wandering spell with an unreadable expression was she a horrible person because she wanted to be with him instead of her parents she hadntseen them in over a month she should be happy to be with them again however they were staring at her in an accusing way as if she had chosen to be in the middle of this danger all the time well actually she did choose to be there and nothing they could say would make her not want to be with harry and the weasleys she couldntleave them not now she would have to find a way to tell her parents that she wasntgoing home with them like they expected her to harry body gave a frightening jolt and hermione couldnttake it any longer excuse me she said giving her parents the brush off hermione her mother said forcefully but hermione wasntlistening she stepped around them and went to ron who didnttake his eyes off harry but put his arm around her harry was now examining his hand with great interest hermione wondered if the wandering spell also made you go a bit nutters can you hear me harry asked tonks hermione watched as harry opened and closed his mouth wordlessly looking similar to a fish out of water before nodding slowly look around can you see anything there was no answer for a moment though harry head was moving slightly from side to side as if inspecting something and ron groaned in frustration is ginny there can you see her demanded ron harry head shook hermione had no idea that a person under the wandering spell was so active really they could see just about everything harry was doing every move he made other than walking hermione guessed this was why harry had to lie down they could see him act out on the floor of grimmauld place ron sighed and tightened his grip on her slightly was it wrong of her to be thinking about him in that way while ginny was gone and harry was doing a dangerous spell trying to find her yes she decided it was slightly inappropriate but she couldntstop thinking about him did he return her feelings by holding her or was he merely comforting her she had been through a somewhat traumatic experience after all nothing happened for a few moments harry was chewing his lip as if debating something not one set of eyes left him even hermione parents were watching intently now nobody missed the pained look that crossed his features or the way his whole body seemed to tense what is it asked tonks what wrong he didntanswer had he been caught was that even possible hermione wasntfamiliar with the wandering spell it was something taught to aurors during training and she could only vaguely recall coming across it once during fifth year when she had gone through the entire library for yet another round of light reading but the book that had mentioned it had offered no explanation for it and she for once hadntchosen to explore it further how was she supposed to know that this would happen that harry would ever have to do this sort of spell harry at last harry body relaxed hermione let out a shaky breath and forced herself to keep her eyes on her friend almost afraid of what his body would do next the silence in the kitchen was deafening and hermione hadntrealized that she had begun daydreaming until tonks interrupted her train of thought again fifteen minutes left hurry harry shook his head and his body stiffened slightly his features tightening he looked angry something had set him off hermione thought she hoped against hope that he wouldntdo anything stupid the anger seemed to be replaced with fear moments later as hermione heard him gasp giving her the sense that something big was happening she hated this not being able to see what was going on at malfoy manor she was sure it was something awful something she didnt want to see but she wasntvery fond of being kept in the dark she needed to know things she needed to have answers she needed to give answers she was hermione granger it was what she did mrs weasley was clutched in mr weasley arms hermione hated this why did the weasleys constantly have to suffer whether it was bill or percy or mr weasley it was as if the family had a huge target on their backs and now ginny was in danger who would be next would it be ron hermione shuddered and leaned against him into his arms tonks gave kingsley a worried look are you getting anything she asked harry a flicker of annoyance passed over harry features but he didntanswer are you there why wasnthe answering hermione understood that he couldntspeak but he could at least nod or shake his head or something ron let go of her and took a few steps forward bloody hell are you listening he yelled at harry is she there or not hermione grabbed his arm and attempted to pull him back ron well honestly he said spinning around to face his mum make him answer us bill and charlie shot ron warning glances an eternity seemed to pass after that hermione leaned against the wall and stared down at harry tapping her foot in silent unison with the ticking of the kitchen clock whoever said that waiting was the hardest part had been absolutely correct this was murder she felt as though someone was staring at her and looked up to find her parents watching her closely well her father was watching her her mother on the other hand was watching everyone else she was staring at everyone in the room as if they had all sprouted three extra heads and hermione felt slightly annoyed and yes irritated at the critical look on her face so they werentperfect but they were her friends they were her family just as much as her parents were actually her parents were going to have to learn to accept that the grangers and the weasleys had always gotten on quite nicely in the past why at the beginning of the summer they had all gathered at the burrow and had a nice dinner but that was before hermione had been injured she knew she couldntblame her parents for being slightly skeptical it would be too big of a risk to tell hermione parents about the horcruxes and so they were left in the dark they had been forced to draw their own conclusions as to how hermione had gotten hurt perhaps they could have let it go and gotten past it but she had also been injured at the end of her fifth year and she had been petrified in second year it looked bad she had to admit her mother was now looking around the room a thought struck hermione her parents were at headquarters she had realized this before of course but the weight of the situation only hit her now if they couldntknow about the horcruxes would it be safe for them to know where grimmauld place was even if they werentacting as secret keepers they could still be tortured for information professor hermione said in a soft voice taking a few steps toward mcgonagall my parents they wont they wontbe in danger because of this right i mean they re at headquarters and they re muggles you see no miss granger said mcgonagall who wasnttaking her eyes off harry if you are truly concerned however we can modify their memories with their permission of course mrs granger let out a small yelp and hermione shook her head um no i dontthink that will be necessary mcgonagall nodded and hermione forced herself to look back over at her parents headquarters her father demanded hermione what have you gotten yourself into hermione shook her head not answering and went back over to ron she couldntdeal with this right now it was too overwhelming everything about this day was utter crap and she just wanted to go to sleep and wake up tomorrow to find that it was all a dream a nightmare a hallucination it could be anything really she wasntpicky lupin muttered something to tonks who sighed you have five minutes she said her voice sounding worried harry fist clenched at his side and his face was screwed up in concentration this is mad ron muttered i hate not knowing what happening i hate that all we have to go by is harry bloody facial expressions hermione nodded and frowned bill began pacing the room charlie was standing in the corner so still that hermione had to wonder if he had been petrified fred and george were sitting in two chairs apparently not finding anything about this situation remotely funny percy was cracking his knuckles nervously percy what was he doing there hermione wondered what had happened while she and ginny were at the pond percy had been stunned had he been fighting alongside his family had they made up had they simply come together for ginny sake but were still estranged it was far too confusing there were too many possibilities thirty seconds harry thirty seconds harry hadntfound ginny he would ve given some indication he would have nodded or jumped or done something there was no hope now maybe ginny wasntthere maybe malfoy had only given her that message to throw them off voldemort trail ginny hermione heard ron inhale sharply had harry just said what she thought he said it sounded like he had whispered ginny name everyone took a few tentative steps closer to harry it okay he whispered i going to come back for you i going to kill them all for this harry was going to come back for her did that mean ginny was alive hermione breathed a sigh of relief but then the rest of his statement was processed in her brain he was going to kill the death eaters there wasnta doubt in her mind that he would too that was scary harry her best friend the one she d known since she was eleven was going to become a murderer twenty seconds he was going to become one anyway regardless of whether or not he killed a few death eaters he would have to kill voldemort but that was different there was no way around killing voldemort merlin how had it come to this harry was going to be a murderer and judging by the look on ron face when he found out that ginny had been taking he was going to become one as well they werentgoing to be innocent any longer but really how innocent had they been in the first place hadntthis war stolen their innocence long ago was killing someone really going to make a difference a death eater was evil but there was still a person under those robes hermione didntthink she d be able to kill one of them ten seconds said tonks shifting on her feet get ready she was slightly unnerved but she wasntsure if it was because she felt sure ron and harry would be able to kill one or because she didntparticularly think they would be committing a sin by doing it but hermione had know all along logically that virtually nobody would escape the war without getting a bit of blood on their hands if it came down to it she would do what was best for harry for ron and for everyone else she loved she would be able to kill she would force herself to do it this revelation knocked the wind of out her she was willing to take someone life in order to protect harry ron or ginny but it wasnteven them per say if it was any of the weasleys if it was tonks or lupin or kingsley professor mcgonagall even moody she would draw her wand and hold her breath hoping she had enough feeling to conjure the killing curse they had lost so many people already so many wonderful people who didntdeserve to have their lives taken away she thought of sirius of dumbledore of harry parents and neville s too she thought of gideon and fabian prewett the uncles ron and ginny sometimes mentioned the ones who had been killed by voldemort years and years ago she knew that they wouldntlose any others not if she could help it she would never lose her parents or the weasleys they would get ginny back and she would be okay hermione couldntlose ginny one of her best friends the girl whose smile lit up a room and whose heart was as big as they came she would never lose harry sweet brave noble harry to the fight she would never let him quit never let him give up or be killed by voldemort and no matter what she would never lose ron the first thing harry said when the spell wore off was bastard ron was impressed that hermione didnteven flinch on the contrary she was chewing her lip and seemed to be deep in thought about something merlin she was gorgeous well he asked eagerly regaining his head harry got to his feet his eyes wide with worry looking momentarily disoriented snape he yelled snape is there with ginny they re at malfoy manor i saw them snape snape the one who had killed dumbledore some two moths previous was with his sister was he torturing her asked bill harry shook his head he was probably about to though he yelled the urgency in his voice rather apparent now professor ginny is there i know for a fact why are we still standing around let move very well said mcgonagall potter granger weasley you may go up to bed miss granger please show your parents to a room everyone else follow me wait what was going on ron blinked stupidly trying to understand what had just happened harry had done the spell and found out that ginny was really at malfoy manor they had everything they needed all they had to do was storm in there and bust her out why was mcgonagall acting as though ginny life wasnt on the line here his sister was alone with snape completely defenseless and everyone was standing around twiddling their bloody thumbs excuse me harry said sounding a bit panicked and very incredulous but you re not serious right we arentgoing up to bed professor dontyou get it ginny is gone she at malfoy manor with all those death eaters she isntgoing to come back unless we do something which is what we will be doing potter mcgonagall said firmly we now know that miss weasley is being held at malfoy manor but we still cannot make a move without strategizing she placed her hands on her hips and gave him a stern look we will need time a few hours perhaps to properly plan this she continued when i suggested that you get some sleep i merely assumed you would like some you are more than welcome to go up to the drawing room and wait if you would prefer it what i would prefer is for all of us to quit standing around here with our heads up our arses cried harry he looked expectantly at mr weasley mr weasley this is ridiculous tell her that this is ridiculous mr weasley bowed his head ridiculous though it may seem he said minerva is right we need to take the proper precautions ron could never recall a time in his life before now when he had wanted to hurt his father to scream at him and shake him until he conceded and ron got his way how could he do this how could he say this it was his daughter at stake mcgonagall was crazy she had gone mad she had lost all bearing and now she was trying to lead the order as if this was a mission for some bloody horcrux or something this was ginny she was about a million times more important that any stupid horcrux perhaps it would be best if miss granger saw a healer before turning in i will contact audrey you look like you could do with a deflating potion for your jaw potter harry met ron eyes and a flicker of understanding passed through them a sense of panic and was that thrill coursed through ron body fine harry sighed angrily c mon let go he motioned for ron and hermione to follow him as he left the kitchen and made his way toward the stairs we ll be upstairs when you lunatics need us mum dad follow me said hermione i ll find you a room to stay in while we wait as everyone split up ron hurried after harry taking the stairs two at a time and stopped beside him in the middle of the corridor we have to leave hermione out of this ron said instantly she cantknow harry nodded the less people involved the better he agreed it you and me that it no matter how ron felt about harry right now in that second the eleven year old boy inside of him jumped for joy at harry acceptance and trust harry could ve easily slipped out without anyone noticing instead he chose to find ron first he chose to include ron where is she in one of the dungeons harry said the place is so sodding confusing there are so many corridors and staircases bloody malfoys ron muttered you know where to go right right said harry okay i ll follow you then harry nodded and cursed except do you know where malfoy manor is exactly ron shook his head we ll never be able to apparate there without getting lost or spliching ourselves and going by floo would be way too stupid even for us how will we do it then asked ron he could feel the hope of rescuing ginny slipping away being replaced with disappointment and dread we need a portkey harry said he sighed and there only one person here who knows how and would even consider making us one hermione said ron what about hermione ron cursed inwardly and spun around hermione was standing behind them a curious expression on her face and her arms folded across her chest well what about me er nothing he said quickly where ve you been i went to set my parents up in one of the spare rooms she said slowly giving them the look she unfolded her arms and took a few steps closer her eyes widening in recognition you re going after her arentyou ron shook his head furiously but harry said yes and we need a portkey harry was completely daft if he expected hermione to help them out ron knew she d never go for it why in the world would she it was crazy and irrational and dangerous and maybe it was okay to ron because ginny was his sister and well he wasntexactly a logical thinker to begin with but hermione was different she had the ability to separate her feelings from important decisions she would more than likely run straight to mcgonagall and tell her that ron and harry were planning on going to the manor alone i ll need my wand hermione said in a very business like tone it at the burrow her eyes flickered back and forth between harry and ron give me five minutes create a distraction or something whatever you do dontlet anyone notice that i gone apparently the entire world had gone nutters because hermione had just agreed to help ron and harry sneak out completely disobeying orders and breaking about a million rules that or ron simply didntknow hermione granger as well as he thought he did no it was the first one definitely hermione began walking down the stairs she stopped at half and turned back around i ll get your invisibility cloak while i there harry harry nodded and they watched as hermione disappeared look ron about ginny ron cut him off with his hand not now please too much was going on for ron to focus on harry and ginny he wasnteven angry about it not really the more he thought about it the less he cared which is what bothered him the most he was supposed to be ginny big brother he was supposed to protect her he was angry with himself not harry he should ve been watching her better or perhaps he should ve realized a long time ago that ginny was resourceful and would do whatever she had to when it came to harry professor ron flinched as hermione voice reached his ears so sorry hermione but i under orders he heard lupin say from downstairs i not allowed to let you ron or harry pass through here i was wait were you going to the fireplace um yes said hermione ron and harry exchanged looks and crept closer to the edge of the stairs to better hear hermione and lupin exchange you see i left my wand and the burrow and i ll need it oh yes of course said lupin hold it if you were simply going to get your wand then why were you creeping downstairs ron held his breath and waited for hermione to answer you know professor that is an excellent question why was i creeping why was i creeping she repeated stalling for time well i didnt i didntwant to interrupt your meeting yes that it and so i thought that if i went quietly i wouldntdisturb you adults harry sighed and shook his head i ll be going to get my wand now carry on ron rolled his eyes hermione was an awful liar lupin chuckled i may be a werewolf but i am not an idiot upstairs with you he said you dontunderstand i i think i understand quite well actually lupin said lightly please hermione go upstairs i d hate to have to cause a scene because you arentobeying orders and are planning well i can only imagine what must be going on in that brain of yours hermione laughed nervously especially since your parents are only just upstairs he pressed on when hermione appeared at the base of the stairs looking defeated ron knew that she had been bested by professor lupin i tried she said quietly harry sighed but nodded we ll just have to think of something else perhaps this is for the best hermione said a few minutes later the trio was still in the corridor sitting on the cold floor and slumped against the rough walls searching their brains maybe mcgonagall was right harry gritted his teeth mcgonagall wasntright just because he ron and hermione couldntcome up with another feasible way of getting to malfoy manor didntmean they shouldnt it only meant that they should try harder well there was a chance that hermione and mcgonagall were right harry knew that he probably wasntthinking as rationally as he could be but ginny was in danger what else mattered really the adults were supposed to be strategizing but how long did that take they had already been waiting for what felt like a few centuries how much more time did they need the worst part was that harry knew ginny wouldntever speak to him again once they got her back she hated him he hated himself all this time harry had been hurting her because he was trying to keep her safe he thought he was protecting her and instead she had been right she had been a target since the age of eleven both because of harry connection to her family and her connection to tom riddle diary and whether she and harry were officially together throughout the summer or not they had been linked at hogwarts snape had heard the gossip and that was enough to hurt ginny to put her in danger no matter how hard harry tried to keep her safe snape knew and that bastard used his knowledge of harry to hit him where it hurt his heart severus snape was the one who told voldemort about the prophecy he was the reason harry parents were dead harry hated snape with a passion but he was not at the top of harry list but if ginny died it would be snape doing and he would earn himself the top position on said list harry didntcare snape would even be ahead of voldemort something dumbledore had once told him entered his mind love was what he needed to defeat voldemort it was what saved harry from the killing curse when he was an infant and he knew that if he survived voldemort this time around it would be because of his love for ginny and her love for him how can you even say that demanded ron there are a lot of things to take into consideration hermione said carefully like what harry asked like the prophecy well yes that something to think about said hermione the prophecy is an important part i agree said harry and unless we have a power the dark lord knows not none of the rest matters what are you talking about ginny said harry hermione furrowed her brow suddenly everything seemed to click into place it all made sense was he the only one who saw it dontyou get it hermione ginny the first female weasley to be born in well a long time he said and she was born in august ron eyes widened after a moment but you dontthink yeah i do would someone please tell me what going on hermione interjected harry nearly laughed since when did hermione not understand something she was born in august harry repeated hermione nodded that means that she had to be er conceived around november well that an image every child wants of their parents ron said with a shudder the prophecy was made right at the very end of october harry said ignoring ron what if what if the power was meant to be ginny do you mean to say hermione said slowly that you think ginny is your destiny harry shrugged it sounded right in his head but when she said it aloud it sounded cheap or clich or something silly like that i ve got enough destinies to fulfill already thanks but yeah i guess that what i saying so if the prophecy was never made ginny wouldntexist hermione said more to herself than anyone else or ron would have another brother instead of a sister it makes sense though said ron if the prophecy hadntexisted harry parents would still be alive and he probably wouldntbe friends with me harry frowned ron you wouldnthave asked mum how to get through the barrier ron clarified seeing the look on his friend face and then we wouldnthave met mum wouldnthave practically adopted you if you had a family of your own already and if you didntspend your summers at the burrow hermione said then you wouldntknow ginny not very well at least she paused for a moment and chewed her lip it almost as if some force out there knew that that you d need someone to love harry and so ron sighed my brain is starting to hurt can we just drop this harry nodded but couldntshake the thought that ginny was meant for him that she was destined for him as hermione had put it was it possible or was he looking too far into things but hermione had agreed with him was it merely a coincidence that ginny was the first female to be born into the weasley family in ages or that she was the seventh child of a seventh child hello there harry heard lupin say from the kitchen remus hello how are you not very well actually things around here are rather tense at the moment lupin said yes awful that where is she upstairs harry craned his neck and saw audrey climbing the stairs hermione sighed no no i dontneed an examination she said nonsense audrey said holding up her hands whether you are hurt or not i under strict orders from minerva i must examine you shall we use one of these rooms she suggested hermione didntanswer dontmake this hard hermione hermione muttered something under her breath but stood up and followed audrey down the corridor do anything while i gone warned hermione as she walked away and i ll hex you both harry smirked as ron yelled after her but you donthave a wand they sat in companionable silence for a long moment harry risked a glance at ron hoping to get an idea of what he was thinking and found his friend staring back at him we ll get her back ron said ron assurance caused hope to bubble up in harry chest but he quickly squashed it knowing better than to get his hopes up you dontknow that said harry not for sure i d stake my life on it said ron harry winced didntron get how serious the situation was didnthe understand that ginny was stubborn and wouldntcooperate didnthe understand that the death eaters would mostly likely get bored and annoyed and end up killing her like they did to anyone else who got in their way you hermione and i we ll get her back harry attempted a smile so hermione allowed in on this one then i thought she had to be left out of it ron sighed and nodded she too smart for her own good sometimes i hate to say it but we need her she a better fighter than half those bloody aurors harry nodded silently and looked down at his hands this is such a mess and it it isntyour bloody fault ron said earnestly you fancy my sister harry i but i dontfancy her he said quietly looking back up to meet ron eyes i in love with her ron gave a noncommittal head nod okay so you re in love with my sister so what i in love with hermione if something happened to her would it be my fault then asked ron though harry knew that if something happened to hermione ron would take full responsibility for it harry shook his head his thoughts too focused on ginny to even realize what his friend had just admitted about their other friend i sorry about before i didntmean to hit you i deserved it harry said yeah ron laughed but still if ginny has to be with someone i glad it you harry nodded unsure of what to say in response listen continued ron now shifting uncomfortably and averting his eyes i suppose it wouldntdo to well for me to kill you until after you ve beaten you know who he said lightly but i need to know without going into detail please did you do anything with my sister other than have a few snogs no said harry and ron sighed in relief sometimes harry noted it was just easier to lie disclaimer i dontown harry potter thanks so much for the reviews chapter two new arrangements and midnight chats the feel of ginny beneath him made harry head spin it occurred to him briefly that he was yet again kissing a crying girl only this was much much better than when he had kissed cho he had never felt this way for anyone before ginny cho included she had the ability to make him lose his bearings and yet make him feel so happy that he didntcare if he ever thought clearly again she was even worth jeopardizing his relationship with ron if ron walked in right now harry was sure that his friendship with the youngest weasley son would be collectively over ginny moaned from underneath him and all thoughts of ron were lost harry ran his tongue across her lips seeking entrance she parted her lips and massaged his tongue with her own her hands made their way to his hair raking her fingernails against his skull pulling him closer what was he thinking about oh right ron harry pulled away and shook his head panting heavily ginny sat up and cleared her throat looking at him with a curious expression on her face sorry said harry i didnt you were i just harry ginny said coaxingly it okay i not angry with you harry glanced up at her suspiciously you re not she shook her head no it was kind of nice she added thoughtfully yeah but we we broke up we arentsupposed to you know he stammered tons of wizards arentsupposed to be killed by you know who dumbledore wasntsupposed to die snape wasntsupposed to be a double agent betraying hogwarts not to mention the order hogwarts isntsupposed to close down ron isntsupposed to snog lavender when he clearly into hermione ginny said slowly lots of things that arentsupposed to happen still happen she smiled coyly i donthave to be your girlfriend if you dontthink i ll be safe harry but i still going to snog you senseless whenever the mood strikes me whether i supposed to or not harry gaped at her in shock did he hear her correctly did ginny actually say what he thought she said wanting to make sure he was absolutely clear on this sudden change of events he asked you mean we re still going to er do stuff even though we arentexactly together i have every intention of it yes ginny smiled but i knackered what d you say we just go to sleep you ve read my mind said harry after stifling a yawn he was exhausted both physically and emotionally ginny fell back against the mattress and slid over so harry would have room to lie beside her when he didntmove she patted the spot beside her and raised her eyebrows you want us to er i mean you want me to stay here what about hermione dunno ginny shrugged she ll just have to bunk with ron tonight she offered a suggestive smile tugging at her lips oh ron ll love that harry laughed when ron announced that he was going to check on ginny and harry hermione jumped up and insisted that she go instead ron gave her a curious look but sat back down as if he understood she offered a smile as she scurried out of the room leaving ron alone to stare at the chess set until she returned and made her next move hermione then proceeded to climb the stairs to ginny room hoping she wasntabout to walk in on anything too wanton she noticed the door stood ajar as if it hadntbeen properly closed and peeked inside harry and ginny were in each other arms asleep on her bed it wasntwhat she expected and hermione then had to ask herself exactly what she had expected either way she was glad it had been her and not ron who walked in on this her ginger haired friend wouldnthave taken too kindly to harry lying on his little sister bed his arms draped around her their faces inches apart she knew she should wake harry tell him to get to his own bed before mrs weasley came to check on them and shrieked with indignation but she didnthave the heart to she had known harry for the better part of a decade and had seen him truly happy only a few times this past year dealing with the loss of sirius and now dumbledore had taken a lot out of her friend and she couldnthelp but notice the small smile that was spread across harry relaxed handsome features and ginny the poor girl hadntbeen sleeping at all lately they d come down to breakfast every morning and she d look like the living dead she slept most of the day at least that what hermione assumed she did when she was shut up in her room she crept out of the room and made her way back downstairs to ron it was slightly after midnight and the rest of the weasley had long since retired to their bedrooms it looks like i sleeping with you tonight she said quietly when she returned to drawing room he jumped clearly not expecting her to appear out of nowhere with a statement like that no less and almost sent the entire chessboard flying what well she began harry and ginny are still in her room normally i would be put up in the twins bedroom but there a full house tonight except for bill so she said unless you want me falling asleep in the bed next to charlie i going to have to use harry bed which incidentally is in your room ron stared at her for a long time his brow furrowed he finally asked why is harry still in my sister room it well past midnight and i dontsee what they could be doing that would obviously not that you git snapped hermione they re asleep harry using my bed okay so that last part was a lie but it was the only way hermione knew to calm ron down and keep him from shouting so loud that he woke the whole house you you called me a git ron gaped yes i suppose i did she shrugged anyway if you have a problem you can always stay down here but i going to bed in your room ron ears turned a slight pink but he nodded and choked out yeah yeah i ll be up in a minute hermione nodded and went back up the stairs hearing ron mutter something about harry having planned the entire thing just to torture him hermione frowned was spending a little extra time with her really torture hadntthey just spent quite a few hours alone in the drawing room hardly even bickering at all perhaps she had misread the entire evening because she had had a perfectly lovely time sighing hermione entered ron room and changed out of her robes wondering why boys namely ron had to be so terribly difficult bloody wanker harry is he done this on purpose i bet just to torture me to get a rise out of me he and ginny well the both of them are going to wish the death eaters had gotten them once i through ron took his time gathering up the chess pieces that night trying to give hermione enough time to change and fall asleep before he went upstairs he didntwant to barge in on her changing mostly because he knew he would stare and she would hit him if she was awake she d probably want to have a long conversation about harry and horcruxes and what lay in store for them all he didntmuch enjoy talking about the future when it came to things like that he had no problem discussing future careers what he harry and hermione will do after you know who is gone that was good positive thinking as far as he was concerned but hermione on the other hand was more practical she wanted to think of how they d get rid of you know who because until they did they couldnteven begin to pursue future careers sometimes he privately consulted her about those things but it was very rare unfortunately it gave her the idea that it an acceptable conversation topic so she very frequently had long drawn out discussions about it ron wouldn t ve minded so much but she was so clever and complicated that everything she said just went right over his head and probably harry s too bloody exhausting is what it was after lingering in the drawing room for a few minutes he extinguished the remaining candles with his wand and made his way up to his bedroom his and hermione bedroom he liked the sound of that his and hermione bedroom sounded much better than any other title that he could think of including his and lavender bedroom sometime during their years at hogwarts he and hermione had crossed the friend barrier for ron it was around fourth year with the whole viktor krum fiasco perhaps it was even before that but he was never forced to confront his feelings until the yule ball she looked awfully pretty that night he didntknow when it happened for hermione but he was pretty sure that it did after viktor went back to bulgaria they had loads more arguments about him and they fought more passionately than they used to although he wasntpositive he was fairly certain that hermione had given him the silent treatment because of his relationship with lavender was she jealous and then there was that mclaggen bloke did she really like him or had she only been trying to get back at ron if that was why it had definitely worked they had of course reconciled ron and lavender split up and he assumed that hermione dumped mclaggen who knows maybe something would happen between the two of them now they were pretty close during the funeral when he had wrapped her in his arms and she allowed him to comfort her something that had rarely happened in the past he walked into his bedroom and saw that hermione was climbing into bed his bed er hermione that not harry bed that s er mine stammered ron as soon as he said it he wished he hadn t hermione sleeping in his bed was one of the hottest things he d ever seen heard of or imagined throughout his entire life he should have just gotten into harry and made himself comfortable oh right i didnt i must have forgotten hermione mumbled ron highly doubted that though he ginny and hermione but mostly just he and hermione had spent loads of time in his room the last few weeks not to mention each and every summer since third year surely by now she had mentally distinguished between his and harry beds and even if she hadn t wouldntthe orange chudley cannon sheets have given it away he was about to make a suggestive comment about her and his bed but he stopped short when he saw the look she gave him she scowled trudged over to harry bed got under the covers and rolled over so she was facing away from him without so much as a goodnight what was with her she must have been angry because she wasnteven reading ron didntknow much about books and spells he wasntparticularly good in school he didnthave a vast vocabulary and he was barely capable of doing his own homework he wasnttoo informed on girls though he did learn a few things this passing year or dark wizards or muggles but if ronald weasley knew one thing that thing was hermione granger she was a creature of habit far more predictable than harry or ginny or anyone else in his life when she was bored stressed or anxious happy or angry or any other emotion that a human was capable of feeling she read in fact in the six years that he d known her he could only recount a few times when he had seen her without her nose in a book mostly during battles like the department of mysteries or this year at hogwarts she practically lived in the library especially when owls were approaching but right now she wasntreading perhaps to an outsider that didntseem like a big deal but to ron it meant something hermione was either absolutely completely exhausted and wasntcapable of holding her eyes open any longer or she was feeling something so extreme that she was restless and dissatisfied even with a good book at her disposal of course ron could never ask her what was going on she d either snap at him saying he wouldntunderstand or she would cry hysterically over the silliest thing and he would have no hope of consoling her best leave it for ginny he mumbled before turning on his side putting his back to her after a while ron breathing was starting to even out when hermione gave a quiet frustrated sigh and turned over he opened his eyes but said nothing merely listening waiting for her to make another move from what ron could tell she had just stood up and crept across the floor to a place near the doorway was she going to the loo no ron thought she getting a book hermione book collection resembled that of a small library s and the weasley didntread very much so any book lying around the house would undoubtedly belong to her since she was rarely without a book in hand it came of no surprise to anyone anymore to find a textbook lying around in the kitchen or the drawing room or as the case was one of their bedrooms ron shut his eyes and focused hard on listening to hermione light footsteps as she made her way back to harry bed he heard a barely audible groan of protest as her next to nothing amount of weight settled back onto the mattress it was so quiet that he barely heard her when she whispered lumos and opened her book merlin thought ron she really should have been sorted into ravenclaw no sooner had the thought entered his mind than ron had already vanquished it counting his lucky starts that she had ended up in gryffindor where she belonged what would his life be like if hermione hadntbeen there in his gryffindor house to share it with him for starters his sister would be dead hermione and her endless amounts of research were the sole reason harry and ron had known where to look for ginny and how to get to her harry wouldnthave been able to save his sister if it hadntbeen for her he would never have completed his homework assignments on time or if he had he would ve gotten t on everything he wouldnthave passed any of his owls except maybe defense against the dark arts since that class had been harry obsession and not hermione s he wouldnthave joined the quidditch team because he wouldnthave been made prefect and therefore his mum wouldnthave bought him his cleansweep and he would still be a huge fan of viktor krum s if he hadntasked hermione to the yule ball in fourth year he and lavender wouldnthave broken up or perhaps they wouldnthave gone out at all yes that was likely the only reason ron even considered her was because he needed to snog someone just to prove to ginny that he could her comments wouldnthave bothered him so much if she hadntmentioned hermione and krum the thought of her snogging him was enough to make ron blood boil he wondered if she d kissed mclaggen if she did he would surely make it his goal to hunt that git down and kick his arse he would probably be snapping at everyone left and right because he wouldnthave her to row with and help him cool off ron and hermione were notorious at hogwarts for their rows they fought all the time every chance they got they never held grudges though well hardly ever the occasional incident that really got under their skin was expected but being the amazing friends that they were they were able to look past it within a few days or weeks if it was really bad she was always there for him in that sense when he was worried about quidditch or she about owls they would bicker just to get their minds off of their individual yet equally important impending dooms he suspected that they would be bickering quite a bit now that they were sure the final battle was rapidly approaching and it was putting a great weight on their shoulders though he tried to never discuss harry with her as he felt it was a nasty thing to do and that he was going behind his friend back he did voice his concerns occasionally it occurred very rarely though only when his head was particularly full of thoughts and he needed to articulate some of them or risk his brain exploding from over use now was one of those times hermione whispered ron she stayed perfectly quiet most likely trying to make him think she had fallen asleep i know you re awake in fact i d be willing to bet a large amount of galleons that you re reading hogwarts a history he heard her sigh with contempt before saying yes what do you want he frowned this was not how he wanted to start their conversation he was going to be serious and voice his concerns to her he was going to get personal something that had rarely happened before in his life d you think this ll be our last adventure together he tried to put it as delicately as he could while still managing to get his point across it wasntthe type of thing he just wanted to blurt out being as blunt as possible he didntthink asking her if she thought they d all be killed in the same tone he d ask her to pass the pumpkin juice was appropriate what do you mean ron she asked seemingly more interested do i think we ll split off and go our separate ways once we re through with v voldemort or do i think one of us will die in the process the the second one he feebly muttered she said nothing for a moment considering what he had asked her answer finally came in the form of a short and firm no no no i dontthink this will be our last adventure together as you put it she stated he rolled over to face her and found her watching him the way the light of her wand hit her face made her look exceptionally lovely he was suddenly very aware that he was alone in his bedroom in the middle of the night with her he was also aware that he could legally do magic so there would be no trouble casting a silencing charm if they needed it why not he asked as he forced himself to forget the wanton thoughts he was having about his best friend because she explained it just cantbe we ve been through far too much for something stupid like this to tear us apart this isntsomething stupid hermione lectured ron you know who a scary wizard and while his real job is to kill harry he ll have no problem killing us as well he sighed i dunno what i getting at i guess what i wondering is d you ever feel like the next fight might be your last i mean we ve been lucky so far we ve escaped without anything too serious happening what if our luck has run out she climbed out of bed shuffled across the room at sat on the edge of his he sat up and shifted his legs which were in danger of being sat on to make room for her ron she said taking his hand in hers everything is going to be fine how can you be so sure he asked seeking reassurance although the feel of his hand in hers made all his worries disappear entirely the way i see it we ve been friends forever she smiled sure we only met in our first year but it feels like i ve known you and harry my whole life you re like family to me ron heart sank though he wasntcompletely sure why well she said quickly you re not like family he couldnthelp but notice the way she accented you re and the funny way it made him grin like an idiot but you know what i mean yeah i do he admitted so you see what the three of us have here is a lifelong friendship we ll be with each other until we re all old and grey i can just feel it she continued her eyes twinkling in the light still coming from her wand there no way something bad will happen and we wontget the chance to find out if my theory right there just no way it was hardly the answer ron was expecting from her but it made him feel good just the same you can always do that you know do what act as if the problem in front of you no matter how serious or complicated it may be is just another textbook question you can handle anything i throw at you said ron she beamed up at him a slight blush creeping onto her cheeks how can you do that well i ve thought about it a lot myself she admitted being harry potter best friend is a dangerous job you know it not like we arenttargets too ron opened his mouth to protest but she continued quickly not that i complaining or anything i make an effort to be involved i try hard to help harry and not because i feel obligated to in any way it just that sometimes to an outsider perspective you and i are guilty by association she paused i often wonder what it would be like it i lost you or harry during a battle and frankly i dontthink i d be able to handle it just thinking about it used to give me butterflies she said so i convinced myself that everything would be okay because if i couldntbelieve that i think i would have gone nutters a long time ago wow he said dimly i try not to think about stuff like that but sometimes i canthelp it you re basically the only one i can talk to though i cantsay anything to harry he d just feel guilty and act like it his fault when it isn t none of my brothers would understand and the twins would just make fun of me and mum would go mad if i brought it up around her or dad you re the only one i can talk to too none of my family understands anything about what happening in the wizarding world right now in fact i haventreally even told my parents about last year at the department of mysteries they know the general story but i kind of skipped over the part about my serious injuries and the fact that sirius she stopped abruptly and ron nodded thankful that harry wasntthere he was fairly certain harry was okay with it by now but he didntwant to push it so anything else you d like to throw at me she asked well i d like to throw you down on this bed and snog you until mum calls us down for breakfast in the morning ron thought no cantthink of a thing he replied smiling and hoping she wouldntnotice how red his ears were turning okay then goodnight goodnight he said before he realized what he was doing he kissed her lightly on the forehead she acted like it was no big deal perhaps she was too shocked or embarrassed to mention it because got back into harry bed without another word and immediately blocked out the light of her wand apparently ron thought with a smirk hermione didntneed to read in order to have pleasant dreams tonight disclaimer i dontown harry potter the kitchen scene with ron and hermione in this chapter first popped into my head months and months ago when i was a huge r hr shipper but gasp couldntstand h g and it wouldntgo away the main reason i wrote this story was so i could work in this upcoming scene and i think listening to the song 4am by our lady peace kind of sets the mood for this chapter the kitchen scene especially chapter twenty the rescue this was awful no awful would be harry having to live with the dursleys until he died awful would be mr weasley losing his job at the ministry awful would be waking up tomorrow to find that voldemort had murdered a whole other group of wizards and muggles this was worse than awful because it was ginny and harry couldntdo anything to save her well that wasntentirely true harry could save her if only mcgonagall would let him go after her but instead she had locked herself up in one of the rooms in grimmauld place and taken all of the order members with her she had called it strategizing harry wasntso sure he had done a lot of strategizing in the past whether for quidditch or for sneaking around hogwarts or when trying to get slughorn to give him that memory and it had never taken him this long well the slughorn thing had taken quite a bit of time but that was beside the point harry checked the clock again it had been over an hour since him ron and hermione had been ordered upstairs in that hour they could ve been out rescuing ginny merlin they could ve been back withginnyby now she could be getting killed or she could already bedead but she wasntdead harry knewshe wasn t because he would feel it his scar would twinge when voldemort was up to something and it would throb and burn when something big was happening his heart was aching now telling him that ginny was in danger but it hadntbroken yet so he knew she was okay she was tough she would hold on she had survived voldemort once before after all that was the real dilemma for harry ginny wouldnthave survived if harry and ron hadntgone after her if harry hadntdestroyed the diary and saved her was history repeating itself was harry supposed to go after her now he had had enough he wasnta patient person in a way he couldnt believe that mcgonagall expected him to sit around quietly twiddling his thumbs while everyone else made themselves useful for ginny sighing he trudged resolutely down the stairs once in the kitchen he discovered professor lupin exactly where he had been when hermione had attempted to sneak over to the burrow what do you think you re doing asked lupin i cantgo and get ginny by myself he admitted i ll only end up getting my arse kicked by the death eaters but everyone is in that meeting trying to come up with some bloody strategy and i not going to be excluded from it i sorry lupin said sincerely but i cantlet you pass i have been told that you ron and hermione are not to be allowed into the meeting as minerva tells me you waved that right when you were kicked out of the order earlier today he raised his eyebrows knowingly harry tried to stand tall as he drew his wand you know you re the closest thing to a father that i ve got he said but if you think that i wontdo something drastic to get into that meeting you re wrong harry step aside said harry please fine said lupin who now seemed understanding and slightly amused but if minerva asks i telling her that you bullied me into it harry attempted a smile ron sighed in frustration and paced the bedroom he and harry used during the summer before fifth year he was waiting for harry to come find him to tell him that the meeting was over and they were ready to go get his sister back why wasntharry coming what was taking the order so long there was an annoying sound coming from somewhere in the room ron looked around but couldntfind the source he opened all the drawers but they were empty he pulled all the pillows off of his old bed but nothing was there it was getting louder and louder so loud now that ron could hear nothing but this ticking it was a clock it had to be he walked over to the bed harry had used and it was louder than ever kneeling on the bed he stuck his hand in the space between the bed and wall his fingers brushed against something cold and metal he grabbed it and pulled bringing it to his ear to investigate hearing it tick without thinking he growled and hurled it against the opposite wall loving the sound the clock made when it smashed to bits it was then as he stood there panting that he heard someone clear their throat he spun around and found hermione watching him with wide worried eyes great first he had punched harry now he was throwing things around the room she probably thought he was aggressive and hot tempered and well he was those things and she knew that too but ron had never seen her look at him this way before she was staring at him as if she didntknow him as if she was afraid of him hi he said awkwardly hi are you okay what did audrey say asked ron hermione eyes softened and she smiled slightly she said that i was okay ron sighed in relief she walked into the room and sat down on ron old bed i still have to go home though there was a sinking sense of dread in the pit of ron stomach he sat down beside her on the bed unable to stop thinking about the rest of the summer and how it would feel to not have hermione there harry and ginny would have each other and he would be bored out of his mind holed up in his room writing letters to hermione working up the courage to tell her everything he would never be able to say to her face are you sure your parents wontreconsider i mean dontthey see how much we need you here hermione shook her head they dontunderstand what going on they dontunderstand that even though some dangerous things happen from time to time i safer with you than i am with them ron liked the way she said with you as opposed to with your family or with the order i asked them again when i showed them to their room they re going to let me stay until ginny is safe but i going home first thing in the morning damn said ron i know said hermione it doesntlook as if i ll be able to go look for horcruxes either we ll all die without your help you know even harry wontstand a chance hermione laughed softly you ll be fine without me and harry wontneed me at all she said he perfectly capable he strong and smart and he your bloody hero i get it ron said irritably why was she going on and on about harry couldntshe see that he was the one who was hopeless in love with her hermione head snapped up and she seemed annoyed but the look on her face quickly dissipated when her eyes met his harry is a lot of things she said slowly but he isntmy hero ron didntquite know what to make of that then who who do you think honestly he didnthave a bloody clue what she was talking about but then hermione reached out and rolled one of his sleeves tracing her fingers lightly over the scars on his arms from their fifth year and he knew what she meant r really but she wouldntmeet his eyes when she said dontpretend you didntknow i he paused when he heard her sob what wrong he asked softly brushing a tear away with his thumb merlin he hoped he was doing something right he was rubbish when it came to girls lavender had taught him absolutely nothing about this sort of thing i such an idiot she cried burying her face in his chest i didnthave my wand why wouldnti carry my wand with me i could ve fought them off i could ve saved her ron shook his head though she couldntsee him how could she blame herself no you couldnthave they they would ve taken you too if if you tried to fight them or they would have killed you i just let them take her she said i didnteven try and there was nothing you could do now you must hate me he stiffened and put his arms around her i donthate you i no no no now wasntthe time i donthate you he said weakly ron knew what his feelings for hermione were he had known since second year that there was something there after a long long time of questioning it he decided to let it be he would always feel something more for her but it was only recently that he realized how much more he felt for her perhaps it had happened over this summer or the previous summer or the one before that maybe it was in first year on the train he would never know hermione was shaking she cried for several more minutes before she calmed down and her breathing evened out ron didntlet go for a long time i should go try to sleep she said pulling away the order will probably be a while longer and sleep here ron said quickly she gave him a strange look she wanted to he could tell you you shouldntbe alone my parents are here my parents are here too he said but i dontcare besides you re leaving tomorrow it going to be ages before i see you again my birthday is in a month and the second i turn eighteen i ll be back at the burrow she vowed ron couldntdescribe how good it made him feel to know that hermione would rather be with his family than hers he knew logically that there was something between them something had always been between them but it was complicated hermione nodded and stood up while waiting for harry to return hours earlier hermione had changed out of her dress and into regular clothes ron unfortunately hadntfollowed suit he was stuck in the same clothes he had worn to the wedding do you think harry will be using the other bed tonight hermione asked no said ron but it doesntreally matter he grabbed her hand and pulled her onto his bed hermione relaxed against him and if ron wasntso anxious to go after ginny he would ve settled for lying there forever i have obtained a blueprint of malfoy manor harry heard mcgonagall say and as you will note there are secret entrances here here here here and here harry came to the room and stood in the doorway the order had their backs to him staring something on the opposite wall tonks shifted on her feet and when her head moved slightly harry got a peek at what appeared to be blueprints up on the wall there were red circles around the secret entrances however as harry examined them he couldntsee the room where ginny was being held whoever made these blueprints probably wasntaware of the dungeons if we sneak around to the back entrances kingsley said then we can that ll never work harry piped up from the doorway the order members spun around to face him startled what are you doing here potter asked mcgonagall she appeared to consider this for a moment and what did you say i said that your plan wontwork he repeated we cantsneak in they arentstupid voldemort will have death eaters standing guard at all the back entrances it our only choice said tonks when i did the wandering spell he explained i didntsee a single death eater roaming around the manor i d be willing to bet that they were all stationed at those entrances waiting for us to sneak in they arentstupid they know that we re going to do the only logical thing get a copy of the manor blueprints map out the secret passageways and entrances and attack everyone stared at him expectantly what do you propose we do then if we want to get into malfoy manor we do exactly as i did he said firmly we walk right through the front door get up hermione opened her eyes and sat up how long had she been asleep it felt like a few minutes but it could ve only been a few hours we re going ron get up what was harry talking about where were they going oh hermione nudged ron ron she said it time to get ginny ron eyes flew open and he was off the bed and down the stairs before hermione even realized he was awake harry gave hermione an odd look and they followed him running down the stairs so quickly that hermione nearly tumbled several times when she and harry got to the kitchen her parents were waiting for them wordlessly harry went over to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of floo powder once they had all safely made it back to the burrow hermione saw that the entire house was filled with witches and wizards was this the order hermione knew that there were more than just the ones working with harry to find horcruxes but were there really this many members it couldntbe she reasoned because grimmauld place was the order headquarters why would they have to leave and come to the burrow if they were all order members i called in favours from a few friends at the ministry mr weasley explained so did i added percy hermione knew better than to ask questions now because mr weasley had just subtly warned everyone that many of these people were not affiliated with the order of the pheonix hermione recognized a few of the romanian members cassi anastasia dimitri and ivan and some of the witches and wizards had been at the wedding earlier today they were friends of bill s ones he had made in egypt hermione what going on hermione spun around and saw her parents standing just inside the kitchen of the burrow looking around the crowded area with wide eyes they re muggles mr weasley announced excitedly to the group what the plan asked ron when re we leaving you are not leaving commanded mrs weasley they need all the help they can get mum said ron i seventeen i doing this mr and mrs weasley exchanged looks to hermione amazement mrs weasley shoulders eventually slumped and she relented shaking her head and muttering under her breath i have taken the liberty of finding objects around the house and turning them into portkeys said mcgonagall she spoke with a loud booming voice once that hermione had only heard once before their first day at hogwarts when mcgonagall explained the sorting hat ceremony to them all eyes were trained on her as she spoke our destination is the malfoy manor in wiltshire our goal is to rescue ginny weasley who is being held somewhere inside the manor i ask that you do not use force unless it is absolutely necessary your emotions are to be kept in check at all times this means you mrpotter harry nodded quickly hermione shifted trying to get a better view of mcgonagall it was hard though with all the people in the way hermione had never been so surrounded in her life there were far too many people for such a small area it was suffocating to say the least these portkeys will take us to a safe point just outside of the manor boundaries as i have already outlined the course of action and i sincerely hope you all know that stealth and concealment are required at all times i daresay we are ready to go mcgonagall looked at kingsley who cleared his throat and drew his wand right well since there are far more of us than i had expected we ll be going in shifts wands ready once you arrive at the safe point start moving toward our destination but do not attack until you receive the signal what the signal ron whispered harry shrugged as kingsley divided the order members aurors and other ministry officials into groups and began handing out portkeys hermione noticed that harry ran upstairs and came back down with his invisibility cloak and something else which he quickly stuffed inside his robe remembering that she didnthave her wand hermione tried to make her way upstairs to retrieve it she wondered if she should try a summoning charm but then decided it would be too dangerous her wand would probably end up poking somebody eye out on the way to her outstretched hand not that there was any room for her to stretch out her arm and hand anyway and just where do you think you re going to get my wand hermione told her mum oh no i dontthink so said mrs granger you arentgoing anywhere no i forbid it large groups of people were leaving via portkey there was now room to move around slightly inside the kitchen mum hermione protested i seventeen i of age in the wizarding world and well it a shame that i dontfollow wizarding law isntit your mother is right mr granger said in a tired voice he seemed bewildered and was still looking around the room as if this was some sort of dream you arentstepping foot outside of this room unless it to come home with us do you understand hermione opened her mouth to argue some more but mcgonagall answered for her yes she does said mcgonagall miss granger given that your parents clearly do not want you accompanying the others i am forced to put my foot down on the matter but professor do not argue with me miss granger this wasntfair rage erupted inside of hermione but there was nothing she could do now they would all have to go rescue ginny without her she knew that they were all more than capable that she probably wouldnteven contribute very much in the long run but she couldntpossibly sit around with mrs weasley and wait until they returned could she it had been absolute murder when she and ginny were forced to wait for ron and harry to return on the horcrux mission she couldntdo it again she wouldnt do it again she would find some way to help she d go crazy with worry if she was forced to sit around and wait kingsley was sending groups every minute and a half after ten minutes the room was nearly cleared out the only people left were ron harry kingsley tonks fred george charlie bill cassi seb percy and several wizards who hermione didntrecognize they all said their goodbyes though mrs weasley didntseem too keen to let ron leave ron please dontgo pleaded mrs weasley i cant i canthave all of you out there ron shook his head i have to mum this is ginny we re talking about i cantstay behind on this one but those bastards took my sister he said darkly hermione didntlike the look on his face she had seen it only a few times throughout their six years of friendship and whenever he got like this things didntturn out well and now they re going to pay for what they ve done to her i going whether you like it or not we can either stand here arguing for another hour or you can accept that i leaving and maybe we ll get to ginny before something bad happens mrs weasley let a few tears escape her eyes but nodded and hugged him i love you so much ronnie love you mum mr weasley was next to hug ron i proud of you son be careful you know who he might be there ron nodded and hermione was amazed by how unafraid he appeared i know hermione saw her own mother stiffen she d only given her parents a few vague details about voldemort but her mother had picked up a ton of horrifying facts about him in the short time that they had been at headquarters she now knew all about you know who and the things he had done in a way hermione knew that she couldntblame her mother for not wanting her to go rescue ginny but it didntmake watching everyone else leave any easier to take ron turned away from his parents and began walking toward harry and the others who were waiting by the portkey suddenly he stopped and turned back around one more thing he marched over to hermione pulled her toward him and kissed her really kissed her she stood in shock for a moment before reacting she put her hands on his cheeks and pulled him closer this was wow she didntknow what made ron do it but merlin she was glad that he did the small portion of her brain that was still capable of forming coherent thoughts vaguely wondered why they hadntdone this sooner but then she had always known that this was a long time coming the kiss was hurried and intense they were putting everything into it everything they couldntsay or apologize for saying everything they couldntdo or apologize for doing her lips said she was sorry and her tongue said she loved him her touch said to be careful to come back to her she was somewhat aware of the fact that she was standing in the kitchen of grimmauld place in front of harry her parents the weasleys professor mcgonagall and a few order members snogging ron and she didntcare it was entirely possible that ron might not come back hermione realized this sometime during their embrace this was their first real kiss and it could also be their last hermione wasntgoing to let anyone interrupt it voldemort would have to wait because she was kissing ron and she wouldntpull away to save her own life after what felt like an eternity but seemed much too short ron pulled away i ve wanted to do that since i was fourteen he said quietly he smiled and walked to the portkey she suddenly knew what ginny had meant during their talk weeks ago ginny was sneaking around with harry because she didntwant to waste any more time and lose out on the opportunity hermione had thought that ginny was crazy that ginny was acting like a well like a bit of a slag hermione hadntbeen able to understand back then but she understood now she understood ginny desperation the overwhelming fear that started out in the pit of her stomach but quickly spread throughout her entire body ron like harry was going out to battle hermione like ginny didntknow if the one she loved would be coming back ginny had been forced to stay behind during their adventures and now hermione was the one missing out hermione was the one who would sit at home and feel helpless and inadequate until everyone returned safely ginny had been right on the mark about everything hermione just hadntknown it at the time she hated herself for wasting time she hated herself for not saying something sooner for letting stupid fights and drama come between her and ron it wasntworth it nothing had been worth it and ginny had been right about one other thing too it did suck to feel this way i coming with you hermione said instantly no you aren t her mother interjected this is bigger than you realize mum cried hermione they need all the help they can get i going no you aren t said ron you canttell me what to do snapped hermione i just did ron said quietly hermione gritted her teeth her eyes filling with tears dontyou dare end it like this dontyou dare try to make me mad at you ron sorry he whispered let me come with you no please i cantstay behind hermione pleaded you have to hermione then you have to stay too she grabbed his arm if ron couldntget her to let go and he took the portkey she d probably be pulled along with him he either went with her or he stayed behind with her it was that simple let me go ron said firmly no she said stubbornly i wontstay behind not while you re out there i ll come back i promise what if you don t you once told me that we d all be together until we were old and grey ron said softly and you said that if that was a load of shite ron hermione argued surprising even herself when she cursed i didntknow what i was talking about back then i was an idiot ron smiled and put his lips to her ear i love you he breathed hermione let go of his arm in shock what someone began counting to three we ll talk when i get back ron promised reaching out to touch the portkey they disappeared and hermione didntget to say it back it was dark and harry didnthave a bloody clue where he was the air around him was hot but he could feel only chills as he walked only to be greeted by more and more darkness ron was beside him but then when wasnt ron beside him hermione was back at the burrow her parents werentletting her come along in a way harry knew that this was good he and ron were willing to die on this mission but hermione shouldnthave to be hermione shouldnthave to make a decision like that not for ginny or harry not even for ron and after everything that had happened today every terrible heart wrenching thing harry was able to smile because ron and hermione were going to be okay harry knew now at least that his best friends would have each other if he didntmake it through the war he knew that ron was too stubborn to let anything bad happen to hermione and hermione was too smart to let anything bad happen to ron the walk was long and the hill was steep but harry wouldntlet himself give up he kept climbing he ignored the pain in his legs the pain in his jaw audrey had given him a deflating potion that had taken care of the swelling but it hadnthelped with the soreness at all who knew ron had such a strong right hook harry and ron had fought many times before and harry hoped there would be many more to come but they were normally on the same side and they normally used wands whether battling malfoy or death eaters they had always stood united but harry didntmind that ron had hit him harry knew that he deserved a whole lot more than that he wondered if his and ron kids would be best friends someday in his fantasy the one harry thought up as he stole through the darkness toward malfoy manor ron and hermione would be married harry of course would be married to ginny ron would have a big family seven kids my own personal quidditch team ron would say with a laugh and their house would have a huge library and a ton of muggle things because hermione would insist upon it and ron would know better than to argue harry hadntdecided how many children he and ginny would have he would put up with ten or would even settle for one if it was what ginny would want they would live in a nice house cozy like the burrow but bigger though not large and frightening like malfoy manor harry was crazy he knew that blokes didntnormally think about things like that especially at seventeen but harry mind did something funny when it was faced with the fact that tomorrow might never come it made him want to think about tomorrow about the next day and the day after that besides he needed something to distract him from the pain in his jaw harry couldntwait to get that signal he was worried about ginny and now on top of everything he was exhausted from the walk he just wanted to attack and get the bloody hell out of there he had no idea what the signal was though lupin had said that when the signal was given harry and the others would be able to tell whatever that meant harry had sat in on the rest of the meeting when mcgonagall outlined the basic plan of action he knew what he was doing but ron didn t harry would have to remember to stick by his friend there was going to be no room for error on this mission just a bit longer lupin whispered merlin how much land did lucius malfoy own the portkeys they had taken brought them right to the edge of the manor boundaries this was ridiculous they had been walking for fifteen minutes harry reckoned from somewhere to harry right fred cursed hey ron said harry as they stalked through the darkness yeah mate if if something happens harry whispered you have to tell ginny something for me okay no tell her yourself ron fine said ron but you have to tell hermione the same for me harry didntbother asked ron what he would want harry to tell hermione he knew just as ron knew what harry would want ginny to know harry grinned that was quite the show you put on he said so quietly that he barely even heard his own words as they forged ahead yeah well shut up harry could tell that ron was smiling hermione i hate you for this hermione whispered i hope you know that mrs granger inhaled sharply but said nothing hermione knew that her mother didntbelieve her but it was true if something happened and hermione wasntthere to well she would never forgive her mother if that was the case what was going on with ron right now where was he was he battling had he even reached the manor yet i going to go see if audrey needs any help she said as coldly as she could manage before walking away from her mother just outside the kitchen a room had been cleared out close to a dozen healers were in the room scurrying around as if they were expecting many injured people to come through in the next few hours hermione didntlike the uneasy feeling creeping into her stomach at this thought the healers were shifting through first aid kits and setting different coloured potions out on a long narrow table provided by mrs weasley hermione recognized audrey earl and valerica the romanian healer she met briefly while at romanian headquarters but the other healers were strangers to her is there anything i can do asked hermione audrey nodded and beckoned her over hermione sighed this was going to be a long night the signal had been given and harry identified it immediately as did ron and the others and they did exactly what harry had said to do they stormed right through the front door well harry did at least in hindsight harry noted that it would ve been smart to wake ron before the strategy had been made before attacking harry had briefly explained that ron was to ignore the other rescue teams who were instructed to sneak around to the back entrances and do anything possible to create a diversion and hold off as many death eaters as they could for as long as possible harry ron bill charlie cassi kingsley and tonks werentfollowing that plan they were the real rescuers they were the ones who went inside malfoy manor down to the dungeon to retrieve ginny things didntexactly happen that way most of the death eaters were as harry had predicted standing guard at the back entrances but bellatrix lestrange lucius malfoy dolohov nott goyle crabbe macnair and snape were waiting at the front doors for them and damn it so was draco malfoy potter sneered the younger malfoy it about time you showed up harry couldntagree more gripping his wand tightly in one hand he was more than ready to do what he d wanted to do since last june murder draco you re looking better than the last time i saw you harry snarled back you remember the night you had him do your dirty work for you harry said pointing his wand at snape but not taking his eyes off of draco draco paled where the bloody hell is ginny demanded harry what did you with to her she dead lestrange said coolly harry heart stopped no she isn t he argued oh i think she is it turns out your little girlfriend canthold up under torture as well as one might expect she couldntbe dead harry would know if she was she couldnt be dead because then harry would be dead too he had lived through the death of his parents sirius dumbledore and so many others but ginny he couldntdo it she wasntdead he wouldntlet her be dead my girlfriend harry said boldly is stronger than you think and she isntdead so step aside before i make you step aside lestrange laughed you dare threaten me yes i dare ron coughed leave him for the dark lord snape barked when lestrange pointed her wand directly at harry oh by all means said harry hoping he was coming off more confident than he felt take your best shot your bloody leader couldnttake me out what makes you think you ll be able to lestrange inhaled sharply but didntattempt to curse harry i suppose it for the best though continued harry voldemort would look no better than malfoy if he had to have someone else kill for him malfoy went to charge but his father restrained him do not speak the dark lord name yelled dolohov harry laughed in their faces i think i going to go check on weaselbee draco said teasingly i sure hope nothing happens to her i d hate for her to suffer because you provoked me but harry didntflinch malfoy ever the idiot had just given away the most valuable piece of information ginny was still alive despite what lestrange said i doubt that she ll suffer he spat i ve seen you in action although being in your presence is a sort of torture i suppose draco shot harry one of the dirtiest looks harry had ever seen and backed away slowly stop said snape you stay here i will go check on weasley but listen to him draco said lucius malfoy draco sighed in frustration but didntprotest as snape disappeared from sight taking the same route harry had taken while under the wandering spell if snape hurt ginny harry would kill him no harry would kill snape regardless but if he hurt ginny harry would make sure there was a nice round of torture beforehand harry did the only thing he could think of he stalled he was in no rush to start firing hexes at the death eaters no it would be best to wait until snape came back so harry would be able to gauge what had been happening with ginny shite harry had to close his mind or snape would be able to read it when he returned he had probably been reading it since harry walked in but wait didntsnape need to maintain eye contact in order to do that harry mentally sighed in relief maybe he had gotten lucky his eyes flicked over to kingsley very quickly as if trying to decide what to do next when the man didntappear to be too unsettled by harry stalling tactics harry decided to continue so he said i must say i rather surprised there are seven of us and only eight of you nine if you count draco although i certainlydon t where are the rest of your pals normally you outnumber us ten to one it the only way you even stand a chance after all why you little there was a scream it was a high pitched echoing sound ginny harry tensed though not as much as ron bill and charlie did he knew the sound of ginny screams he had heard them when he did the wandering spell they were a good thing in a way if she was screaming she wasntdead like that do you taunted lestrange yes that sound has been rather common around here today even with the shields we ve put up you can still here the weasley screams all the way up here she must be in an awful lot of pain shut up harry nudged ron hard in the side the time was coming harry could feel it he wouldntbe able to hold ron off for much longer he wouldntbe able to hold himself off for much longer now snape muttered mustering all of her strength ginny tossed her head back and screamed again ginny screamed again squeezing her fists in concentration this needed to sound real or else snape would get in trouble and there would be no hope for ginny where was harry wasnthe coming for her he was supposed to love her but he wouldnteven try to save her potter is upstairs snape said automatically ginny gasped snape was reading her mind had he been doing it this whole time wait harry was upstairs but she was well she wasntsure where she was she knew it wasntupstairs though how would he get to her he knows everything said snape he will be able to find you how ginny whispered for once snape shrugged in reply how am i going to get out the same way we discussed before he said donttell me you ve forgotten you silly girl of course i haven t she said quickly but if i do this what about you wontthey know potter is strong snape said his voice heavy with great displeasure he is stronger than before and he is only getting stronger what does that mean ginny asked never mind what it means snape insisted growing impatient do you remember what i have instructed you to do yes do you remember what you promised in return for me helping you she hesitated do you remember yes she whispered but harry will i am aware he said curtly he pointed his wand at ginny and the invisible ropes around her arms and legs must have fallen away because she was free ginny struggled before finally standing up wincing at the pain that shot through her limbs as she did so the cruciatus curse was more painful than she had imagined but the aftereffects were nearly as bad she expected that she wouldntbe able to move painlessly for another week maybe even two she wondered if she would be able to get out of the manor and knew that if she wouldntmake it if she had to run thank you once more ought to do the trick snape said ignoring her ginny nodded and screamed this is in your hands now wait for the signal then get into position ginny nodded her neck hurt too as the rest of the death eaters and members of the rescue crew battled all hell breaking loose around him harry ran straight into the crowd when he was sure that everyone was immersed in their own battles and no longer paying attention to him harry pulled out his invisibility cloak and threw it around himself safe under its protection he weaved in and out of people running down corridors and through various rooms down flights of stairs finally just as he began to wonder if he was going in circles he found what he was looking for and the door was opened harry could ve dropped to his knees and kissed the dirty floor the door was open snape the bloody idiot must ve forgotten to close it after he finished with ginny he ran into the room and found only ginny inside slumped against the wall he was vaguely aware that she was in a different spot than she had been when he did the wandering spell but disregarded it was she conscious he threw the invisibility cloak off of him and fell to his knees beside her ginny he said struggling to keep his voice quiet ginny eyes shot open harry she said her voice sounded hoarse as if she had a bad cold harry attributed it to the amount of screaming she had probably done and shuddered c mon he whispered we need to get you out of here remembering something he reached into his robes and pulled out her wand take this it crazy up there you ll need it ginny grabbed it and he helped her stand trying to be as careful as possible she was moving stiffly as if her entire body was in extreme pain he studied her and saw no cuts or bruises which meant only one thing the cruciatus curse he couldntkeep quiet any longer he had to know what did snape do to you he asked as he led her down one of the corridors ginny sighed and wouldntlook at him harry no he she stopped and made a sobbing sound he tortured me she whispered it was awful she sobbed again and harry wanted to comfort her the sounds of battle were getting louder and he was reminded of what he had to do he handed her the invisibility cloak and she wrapped it around herself disappearing before his eyes they made it back upstairs taking slightly longer than it had taken harry to get down to the dungeons ginny was wincing but moving as quickly as she could harry wanted nothing more than to pick her up and run with her but knew that he couldn t she had to stay under the invisibility cloak until they were safely outside of the manor he didntwant to leave her but knew that he had to it was the only way they would both stand a chance of making it out alive you re coming home with us said mrs granger as soon as possible nothing has changed we ll leave tonight if this whole thing wraps up at a reasonable hour hermione didntappreciate the things her mother was saying nor did she appreciate the tone she said them in she sounded bored she sounded as if this whole thing was a muggle video game or movie this is real screamed hermione unable to take anymore ginny was really taken and my best friends really went after her mum this isnta joke apologize to your mother mr granger ordered i sorry she spat i sorry that you dontcare about my friends i sorry that you dontcare about me of course we care about you then why are you trying to take me away from the weasleys asked hermione her voice breaking slightly this is my home now i belong here with them you swore to us said mrs granger when we agreed to let you go to hogwarts it was under the condition that you wouldntforget about our world and not only have you forgotten about your roots but you ve forgotten about us i not going to fight with you hermione said not now when we re all dealing with so many things i not going to make in scene mrs granger sniffed you re still coming home with us she mumbled he was battling mulciber when it happened protego he cried he put his shield up just in time to stop the spell from hitting him a flash of red appeared before him ginny appeared before him she was supposed to be under the invisibility cloak what in the name of merlin was she doing weasley he heard lestrange cry it was as if everyone stopped battling stopped moving stopped breathing it was as if everyone was watching lestrange has the little rat gotten out of her cage hmm i suppose a cage canthold you anymore perhaps i can do you one better lestrange pointed her wand at ginny and he knew what he had to do he had known for a while now that he would do it if faced with the situation honestly he d known since he was eleven that it was a possibility he just hadntever admitted it to himself he had tried not to let himself think about it before he had mentioned it here and there but he had never really believed that it would come to this and now it was up to him to to oh merlin but he couldntbe afraid he had to save ginny ginny she had to live the world would be such an awful place without people like her in it but everyone would be fine without him they had to be better him than ginny right he was doing this for the entire wizarding world and the muggle world too he was doing it for ginny and for hermione for everyone he was frozen in fear for several moments then he heard lestrange mutter a spell one he had never heard before and something inside of him snapped it was now or never he threw himself in front of ginny and took the blast time seemed to move in slow motion as he watched lestrange point her wand at ginny he watched as his best mate jumped in front of her and disappeared into thin air he screamed out his friend name but it was no use ron was gone that thought repeated over and over in harry brain as he gripped his wand not caring what hex he threw or where it ended up ron was gone and they would never see him again his wand just wasntdoing the trick harry no longer wanted to stun the death eaters he wanted to kill the death eaters for what they had done to ron to ginny to everyone in the world who was good and didntdeserve the bad things that happened to them ron was gone and it had almost been ginny harry lost sight of ginny and for once he couldntbring himself to care all he could focus on was the feeling in the pit of his stomach the feeling that was making the hair on the back of his neck stand on end ron was gone and it was harry fault his scar prickled his skin crawled his temperature rose to an almost unbearable level his stomach churned his fingertips itched ron was gone and now mrs weasley only had six children this time harry knew it was coming harry knew that he was going to do more wandless magic he could sense the feelings building up inside they were more intense than they had ever felt before this was even more intense than the feeling he got earlier today when he had done this sort of magic at the wedding ron was gone and harry had promised ron that he d give hermione the message harry gasped at the newfound power that exploded deep inside of him it was as if every pore in his body was opened and he suddenly felt so dizzy so tired from his exertion he wanted to sleep and maybe he did because the next thing he was aware of was lupin crouching over him calling his name he opened his eyes and knew that he must have blacked out because he didntremember closing his eyes and he certainly didntremember falling to the floor but did it matter ron was gone it been an hour and twenty five minutes mrs weasley announced hermione wished she would stop doing that every five minutes mrs weasley announced how long the rescue groups had been gone hermione didntcare if it had been an hour or a year every second felt like an eternity and something wasntright she had started sensing it about twenty minutes ago yes it had to have been twenty minutes ago hermione knew because she remembered mrs weasley saying it been an hour and five minutes right after the feeling arose in her stomach the sense of dread that had coiled so tightly inside of her had relaxed significantly she felt unafraid and full of hope she felt free she was flying she was weightless and powerful and mortal she felt destructible and that was something that should frighten her but it only made her feel at peace and humbled she now knew why people took risks she knew why muggles jumped out of airplanes with nothing but a parachute strapped to their backs she knew why ron and harry and ginny loved flying so much it was because of this feeling she sat there marveling in this newfound understanding until they heard a strange sound coming from outside she knew that everyone was back jumping to her feet hermione exchanged a look with mrs weasley and sucked in a big gulp of air though she knew she wouldntneed it she knew that they had rescued ginny she knew this because there was no way harry would have left or let anyone else leave without her tons of people flooded into the burrow already however hermione could tell that there were less people coming back than there should have been hermione stood on her toes looking for flaming red hair most of these people were injured hermione realized because they were all going directly toward the stations the healers had set up to tend to victims as the crowd thinned out hermione was able to spot harry he was wandering almost aimlessly his eyes were cold and hollow ginny was in his arms looking tired and weak and more childlike than ever before she was crying sobbing really and hermione wondered how much the girl had been through to make her cry like that fred and george were standing on either side of harry their expressions blank everything about percy demeanor was all wrong he didntcarry himself the way he used to when hermione had known him his shoulders were slumped and his head was hung low as he trudged in behind harry bill and charlie were behind percy their faces the absolute definition of defeat hermione didntunderstand why she wanted to shout to tell them that ginny was in harry arms and that she was safe again they didntseem to notice hermione surveyed the weasley boys again wondering what was going on these were not the faces of people who had just rescued their sister mrs weasley ran over and immediately began fussing it was only then when mrs weasley said his name and hermione suddenly realized that she hadntseen him yet that everyone noted the absence of a certain weasley hermione would never know why she hadntnoticed it right away she would never know how she hadntmanaged to put two and two together the second everyone walked in she would never know why even after she figured out what must have happened to him the feeling of calm hadntleft her but had intensified somewhat but she didntcare and she doubted very much that she would care about anything ever again the only thing that mattered was that ron hadntcome back i adore ronald weasley rest assured he is very much alive so sorry that this took a long time to be posted but was acting weird and wouldntlet me sign in at all on the weekend and to top it off my power went off on monday but once it came back i spent the day editing and tweaking this chapter although the content is rather depressing and the wait was long too long i hope that the length of this chapter makes up for it disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty one the heartbreak harry set ginny down on her feet if ron wasntin the forefront of his mind he would ve noticed that he still felt faint from his exertion at the manor or more importantly the fact that ginny wasntmeeting his eyes where is he whispered hermione harry hated himself because he hadntbeen able to stop lestrange from taking ron he hated himself because he didntknow what had happened to ron and he didntknow what to tell mrs weasley but mostly he hated himself because he couldntlook at hermione he was afraid of what he would see in her eyes if he did bill was the first to speak he said bill he wasntkilled he said quickly and ginny inhaled sharply but he gone he was taken what do you mean asked hermione her voice rising with each word what happened to ron ginny hiccupped and collapsed into harry arms again harry finally found the courage to pull his gaze up from the floor and look at hermione she looked lost as if she didntunderstand what was happening as if she didntknow what to believe harry wanted to sit down and tell her to explain everything but he couldn t he was afraid that if he spoke he would break down and then who would be strong for everyone all of the weasleys were crying or close to it even bill and charlie had tears in their eyes tonks was crying too lupin was holding her harry couldntsee his face but lupin looked as if he could be mourning as well mr and mrs weasley were holding each other ginny had harry lupin had tonks even the grangers had each other who did hermione have she used to have ron where was ron now harry heart broke for her if it was him if ginny had been the one who disappeared he would be assuming the worst he would be going crazy because he would think that ginny was dead harry shuddered was ron dead hmm i suppose a cage canthold you anymore the words lestrange said before doing her spell echoed in harry mind perhaps i can do you one better she was ruthless and there wasnta doubt in harry mind that she would ve found a way to convince voldemort that ginny was useless there wasnta doubt in his mind that she would ve found a way to get permission to kill ginny but instead of getting ginny she had gotten ron hermione must ve shared harry pessimistic mindset because she began taking shallow breaths and shaking her head now staring pointedly at the floor harry knew the exact moment that everything sunk in for it was the moment that hermione lost the colour from her face and when she raised her eyes to his seeking confirmation because only harry after all the three of them had been through could give her this and he nodded tragically her eyes suddenly seemed so much colder harry knew right then that he would never see her eyes dance again he could just feel it hermione leaned against the wall shutting her eyes slowly sinking to the floor the tears did not start slowly they came quickly almost instantaneously and she shook with the force of them her grieving was soundless and yet somehow louder more obvious than anything harry had ever witnessed before she overpowered mr and mrs weasley she overpowered ginny and all of ginny brothers harry had never felt so strongly about her before she was his best friend his sister and it literally tore him apart to see her this way he wanted to go to her to tell her that this was all a bad dream that everything would be okay and ron would be there when she woke up but he couldn t he didntknow if things would be okay truthfully he hated himself because he didntthink that they would be and he couldntlie not to her not about this hermione was on all fours now her forehead flat against the cold floor and her fists pounding against it in what would have been an obnoxious display had it been anyone else instead it was quite the opposite harry felt as though he was intruding on something as if he and the others were interrupting a private moment of hermione s as morbid as it sounded he wanted to leave the room and leave hermione alone to cry and he might have if ginny hadntgone slack in his arms mrs granger pushed through the people and dropped onto her knees attempting to wrap her arms around her daughter but hermione wouldnthave it she pushed her mother away and half yelled half sobbed this is your fault mrs weasley who had broken out of mr weasley tight embrace went over to the fallen girl hermione clutched her tightly and the two women cried together on the floor as mr granger wrapped his arm around his wife and muttered something to her about how their daughter needed her people right now harry didntknow when or even if he would ever see his friend smiling face again he didntknow if ron would ever come back he didntknow if ron was still alive or if lestrange had done away with him immediately after realizing that she had nabbed the wrong weasley harry was feeling far too many emotions to let any particular one out he just stood there hanging onto ginny with everything he had as if she too would disappear it could have been her it almost was her but ron saved her he was a hero and if ron didntcome back then someday when they were ready to hear it harry would tell hermione and mrs weasley exactly what had happened to ron harry couldntremember going to grimmauld place but he knew he must have for he was now sitting on the cold hard floor that he had known so well in the summer before his fifth year ginny had been checked out by audrey who said she would need to go to st mungo s but ginny mumbled something about not leaving her family and despite harry concern for her well being he found himself nodding in agreement and carrying her upstairs it had been six hours since they returned from the manor and there was still no word on ron they hadntgiven up not by a long shot but harry could feel some of the hope slipping away with every tick of the clock overhead harry knew that a part of them all had potentially died that night along with ron they had all wandered throughout the house throwing things crying cursing and crying some more until hermione harry and the weasley children wound up in the drawing room hermione was sitting in a chair absentmindedly playing with two chess pieces looking at them lovingly she was hiccupping having only stopped crying a few minutes ago harry hadntknown it was possible to cry as much as she had that night ginny was lying on the floor facing up at the ceiling eyes closed and breathing erratic fred and george were huddled in a corner occasionally throwing out things like remember when we teased him for making prefect or what about the time we pestered him about that brown girl followed by a series of curses and dirty names all directed at themselves percy sat alone in a corner isolated from everyone his head in his hands charlie was still pounding his fists into the walls and throwing books a true testament to hermione grief in that she did not stop him from such a heinous act bill was fidgeting in his seat occasionally getting up to pace the room never remaining still for more than a second as if the news of ron would hurt more if he stayed stationary mr and mrs weasley were downstairs being comforted by lupin tonks and mcgonagall who stayed behind when the other order members and ministry workers departed from the weasley house after offering their sympathy and promising that they would do everything they could to locate ron fleur was also downstairs doing her best to not intrude on any personal family time as she had still not managed to become a true weasley as harry and hermione had harry sat on the floor leaning against the wall thinking of his best friend his head was swimming with images he did not want to see thoughts he did not want to think he could picture ron on the train to hogwarts during first year holding his mum sandwiches and stared at harry with awe he could hear ron irritable voice as he called hermione a nightmare and see his face when he found out ginny was the one dragged into the chamber of secrets he saw ron with scabbers on the night he turned into peter pettigrew and the way he stood up to sirius back when they thought he was a cold blooded murderer he saw ron underwater during the triwizard challenge he heard ron yelling accio brain at the department of mysteries every time he closed his eyes ron was playing chess or desperately trying to protect the rings during quidditch every time charlie ceased throwing books or hitting something and it became ghostly quiet in the room he could hear ron rowing with hermione or laughing or telling harry as they stood mere feet away from dumbledore tomb we re with you whatever happens whatever happens none of them could ve ever predicted what would happen to ron when he made that statement nobody would ve imagined that lestrange would mutter some strange spell that none of them had ever heard before and direct it at ginny nobody would ve foreseen that ron would jump in front of his baby sister and get hit with the spell instead causing a ton of smoke and dust to fly into the air nobody would ve guessed that when everything settled both lestrange and ron would have disappeared into thin air his scar was hurting again searing really and harry felt a pressure in his head soreness in his limbs an aching in his very soul suddenly he remembered something that he hadntbefore have you gotten one yes my lord it it has been taken care of you can always count on me harry gasped when he suddenly detected something in his mind something that should not have been there harry wasntremembering his scar gave a particularly painful throb and he could feel happiness voldemort happiness flare up inside of him he was connected to voldemort more now than ever and for whatever reason he was accidentally seeing what was happening on the other side harry knew that this had its advantages but he bit his lip hard so hard that he could taste blood and focused on clearing his mind he could not afford voldemort entering his mind now he was too vulnerable he would not be able to fight voldemort off it has been taken care of ron was dead harry knew without a shadow of a doubt that lestrange would never lie to voldemort and if she would voldemort would see right through her in a second ron must have been dead harry wanted to die he wanted to grab everything he could reach it all belonged to him after all and smash it into tiny pieces he wanted to kick and scream and cry for his dead friend who had so admirably sacrificed himself for ginny he wanted to forget everything he had to do all the plans and arrangements he needed to make all the horcruxes he still needed to find and just settle the score once and for all he wanted to find voldemort and lestrange and kill them both with his bare hands but he could not do any of this mostly because he would only make a bigger mess of things but also because his body was betraying him all he could really do was sit there and stare into space trying to pinpoint exactly when he had sealed his best friend fate was it when he didntorder him to stay behind on the mission to rescue ginny or was it at dumbledore funeral when he didntinsist that he battle alone could it have been even earlier than that on the train during first year when they met had it been then was that when harry should ve realized that he was making his best friend a target and should have turned back should have turned away from ron what would professor dumbledore think if he could see harry now he would think that harry had failed that he had failed harry harry suddenly wanted to return to hogwarts and see dumbledore portrait he needed to speak with his former headmaster to ask if ron was really dead and if so whether or not he was at peace because really that was the most important thing how can you be so composed hermione whispered harry summoned all his energy and turned to look at her she was staring at him through puffy red eyes still shaking dunno said harry stoically i guess i used to losing everyone who actually means something to me he whispered bitterly well i not ginny mumbled still on the ground if i hadntbeen so stupid if i hadntgotten captured and needed rescuing this never would ve happened if i hadntlet my parents convince me to stay maybe i could ve helped him hermione moaned harry winced feeling instantly guilty that everyone thought it was their faults when really it was his it was only his couldntthey see that we were there too y know bill said regretfully yeah charlie seconded sounding just as defeated harry clenched his hand into a tight fist desperately trying to control his emotions he knew he was failing and thought that perhaps umbridge had been right when she said he wouldntmake a good auror we re to blame more than you are we re older we should ve been able to protect him from shut up harry yelled everyone looked at him shocked by his outburst what happened wasntyour fault any of you it was mine no it wasn t harry began percy sounding exasperated you were fighting amycus at the time that not what i mean explained harry still yelling i he couldntbegin to explain all the things he was at fault for it was his fault because he had befriended ron because he had put ron entire family in danger it was his fault because he had fallen in love with ginny and because he had let voldemort use her to manipulate him to draw him out into the open it was his fault because it my fault for living when voldemort killed my parents harry george argued that isntyour fault yeah mate just think how terrible it d be if you hadntsurvived fred added though neither twin sounded particularly sure of themselves okay fine but i ve known for a long time now how dangerous being harry potter can be harry said and i let ron get involved i let you all get involved he stood up and walked over to the door knowing just as he had known at dumbledore funeral that it was a horrible thing to do but still he couldntbear to face them he couldntbear to hear them trying to reassure him you donthave to pretend for my sake ron wouldnthave been there tonight if it werentfor me ginny wouldnthave none of you would ve sod off harry bill yelled we were there because this is our fight too not anymore it isn t harry snapped i ve done too much to this family already mrs weasley canttake much more of this i dontwant any of you coming along on any more order missions he knew that he was no longer in the position to make those sorts of calls but he couldntcontrol the words from flying out of his mouth charlie turned to glare at harry turning bright red as if he were about to strike him incase you haventrealized you re a member of this family whether you like it or not nobody blames you for what happened ron was of legal age he knew what he was getting himself into you may not have the red hair but you are a weasley and weasleys stick together no matter what so shut up because boy who lived or not i going to hit you if you don t harry watched ginny who was now sitting up and staring at him with hurt uncertain eyes a silent understanding passed through them and harry hoped that she knew how much he cared for her and that although he was utterly defeated by what happened to ron a part of him would always be relieved that it had been his friend and not the love of his life she nodded slightly as if knowing what he was about to do and telling him she would forgive him for doing so and so harry nodded back before turning away from them all and walking away like the coward he felt he was this wasnthappening ron wasnt really gone this was just a stupid joke that he was playing on her he always did have a twisted sense of humour even ron wasnttwisted enough to do this to her where was he she was back at the burrow now bill charlie percy fred and george were still at grimmauld place with everybody else they were well she didnteven know what they were doing but they were trying to find ron that was really all that mattered ginny refused to go to st mungo until things had settled down more audrey had given her some pain relieving potions but the effects were still there and hermione wasntthe only one who noticed harry was being too careful too cautious around ginny he was acting as if he would break her and all the while his mind was elsewhere hermione knew hermione sighed her head was throbbing and her throat was sore her limbs were exhausted as if she had just run across the entire hogwarts grounds she was shivering as if the warmth had left her entire body and she didntfeel as though she d ever feel anything other than emptiness ever again she trudged up the stairs and ended up in ron bedroom she hadntmeant to her feet had just taken her there ginny came in harry wandered up a moment later i glad you re okay said hermione her voice sounding raw and emotional she tried her best to smile failing miserably ginny went over to harry bed and sat down we were here she whispered this morning we were all here hermione could only bring herself to nod she felt a sudden wave of exhaustion hit her and harry must have sensed it or perhaps she had been swaying on her feet because harry wrapped a protective arm around her and held her still you should sleep he advised can we sleep in ron bed asked ginny the three of us i d like that said hermione it ll be squished harry said and hermione muttered a spell the bed seemed to grow wider suddenly she pulled down the blankets and got in not bothering to change out of her muggle clothes ginny motioned for harry to move and he hesitantly stepped up to ron bed sliding under the covers he and hermione made as much room as they could which proved to be enough because of the spell ginny still in her gold dress eased herself in hermione felt harry shift to wrap an arm around each of them and she closed her eyes she wasntused to harry being this way normally he was angry or demanding that he be allowed to go out and fight now he seemed subdued as hermione thought about it she realized that harry had been acting differently for quite some time it was only after ginny had disappeared that he converted back to his old hot headedness she wondered how much of an effect ginny had had on him harry had obviously changed for the better because of her she wondered if she would ve changed ron given the chance and realized that she didntwant that ron couldntget any better anyway she recalled what ginny had said and her heart ached at the memory of this morning when she had woken up in ron arms she had slept in that very bed with him and for a brief moment in time hermione allowed herself to believe it was ron who was holding her close and telling her everything would be alright instead of harry and for that moment everything seemed okay but that moment passed because whether for a week a month or for the rest of their lives ron was gone harry did not sleep through the night he did not sleep at all actually he felt drained and more exhausted than he could ever recall feeling before in his life but he could not sleep he stared up at the darkened ceiling listening to the deep even breathing of ginny and hermione he hadntrealized that he was waiting for something until it came hermione was the first to cry out his name the first to clutch harry tightly and whimper in her sleep he was surprised that ginny hadntawoken from hermione outburst harry feeling slightly guilty for not knowing how to comfort her merely stroked her hair and didntlet go of her until her breathing went back to normal and her cries ceased ginny was next her nightmare was more intense though and it sent a chill down harry spine when he heard her whisper tom tom please no she was having the same nightmares she had suffered from after her first year at hogwarts i dontwant to go down there harry closed his eyes as the image of ginny down in the chamber of secrets appeared is his mind how had he not fallen in love with her then how had he not fallen for her the very first time he saw her he didntunderstand it every time he saw her now every time he thought about her he fell in love with her a little more but why had he been so thick back then it wasntas if he had too much on his mind to notice girls he had noticed cho he had really noticed cho and he had noticed hermione he had never felt anything for her but he had noticed her still but ginny she was always ron sister perhaps that was why harry had never paid her much attention to him she was off limits ron was his best mate there were rules about those sorts of things but really when did harry follow the rules ron oh ron no harry winced at the sound of her voice she was vulnerable and raw and full of anguish he whispered in her ear and she calmed down almost immediately though harry now noticed that her cheeks were damp harry her voice was different now happier and harry smiled genuinely something that felt awkward and inappropriate and disgraceful somehow but he couldnthelp it ginny was dreaming about him he was in her dreams calming her comforting her perhaps they still had a chance after all love you love you too harry whispered finally when he could stay awake no longer he dropped off to sleep disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty two wounded harry awoke the next morning and cursed he had spent the night in bed with ginny it was a good thing he had woken up when he did or else mrs weasley would ve walked in on them and then she d yell and scream and he d be slaughtered by ron ron it felt as if harry had just been sacked with a ton of bricks he cursed again more forcefully this time and ginny stirred harry she groaned without opening her eyes i think i need to go to st mungo now where does it hurt he asked shifting so he could see her better in the dim lighting perhaps having her lie still all night wasntthe best idea her muscles were probably even tenser than before everywhere harry sat up and noticed that hermione was no longer beside him taking advantage of the extra room on the bed he managed to get on his feet without climbing overtop of ginny can you walk he asked as he put his glasses on again and then held out his hand to stop her when she tried never mind he said i ll just carry you i can walk ginny insisted stubbornly as harry lifted her up i know you can harry said though he didntreally believe her he must ve sounded as doubtful as he felt because ginny scowled i can harry i never said that you couldn t ginny glared at him something that seemed to take all of her energy put me down she commanded harry shook his head and didntstop walking he shifted her weight in his arms and tried to block her out as he went down the stairs he needed to concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other or they d both end up as patients in st mungo s harry i can take care of myself like you took care of yourself at the pond the second he said it he regretted it ginny jaw dropped and harry realized that he had stopped walking she looked as if she was about to snap at him and he wished that she would just let him have it because he knew he deserved it but instead she dropped her gaze and took a deep breath put me down she whispered i dontwant you to help me just put me down please harry didntwant to put her down he knew that she would go into her room and shut the door or worse she d go to st mungo without him he wanted to hold her and make her listen as he apologized make her accept his apology and believe that he hadntmeant it because he hadnt but harry put her down and didnteven try to stop her as she staggered into her bedroom and shut the door softly behind her ginny was an idiot why couldntshe just let harry carry her she was in pain she probably wouldnteven be able to walk down the rest of the flights of stairs without his help but she just had to be stubborn about it damn her and her stupid pride it hurt a lot it hurt all over it hurt when she took a step or even a breath when she coughed or swallowed or blinked the worst part wasntthe physical pain though what hurt the most was that harry had thrown everything back in her face she knew he hadntmeant it she hoped he hadn t at least but then again why would he say it if he didn t it wasntas if he cared about her or anything if he did why would he have broken up with her why would he have led her on all bloody summer he said that he loved her but he didn t he couldn t a part of ginny wondered if harry was even capable of love she wouldntblame him if he wasn t though after everything he had been through it would be a miracle if he could feel anything other than hate merlin help her she was so bloody in love with him and no matter how many times he pushed her away she would only try harder she would never give up on harry potter she would always want to be with him maybe that was what hurt her the most she was out of breath now she had only walked from the corridor into her room over to her wardrobe and she was out of breath what was worse her heavy panting sent searing pains through her body the cruciatus curse was bloody murder she thought about how close to death she actually was yesterday she thought about ron and shuddered wondering how close to death he was at that moment she nearly cried out in pain it hurt to shudder she cursed when she stumbled and nearly toppled over onto her dresser she was such a mess oh she needed harry but he was probably already down in the kitchen getting food or maybe he had gone back to bed ginny harry said through the door and ginny would ve jumped if her body didntfeel as if it weighed four times as much as usual i coming in harry came in and frowned when he saw her what re you doing in here we should get your mum and go get you checked out what if you have internal injuries i need to get changed she croaked out i cantgo there in this dress and i ll need to run a brush through my hair and wash my face ginny could tell that harry thought she was being stupid the healers at st mungo wouldntcare if she had a bit of dirt on her dress or if her hair was in knots but he knew better than to argue with her instead he went to her wardrobe and pulled out jogging pants for her he didntbother asking if she needed his help he dropped to his knees silently and slowly slid his hand up her thigh pulling off her stockings she watched him intently as he kissed her calf once before helping her step into the bottoms he had chosen for her when he stood back up she nearly gasped at the look on his face his eyes were swimming with concern and guilt and yes love harry pushed the straps off her shoulders and the dress she was wearing fell to the floor but ginny forgot to blush she knew that harry was doing his best not to look at her chest in hindsight perhaps she should ve worn a different bra one that fit her a bit better but she had originally thought it would be better to wear something tighter than normal she hadntwanted to er fall out of her dress arms up he said quietly ginny lifted her arms over her head trying not to wince at the pain that flared up inside of her why couldntshe handle the pain harry had been subjected to the cruciatus curse before and he had never been so incompetent and dependent on others but he hadntbeen victim to it as much as she had been lestrange had been almost relentless and for a while there ginny wasntsure she d even make it out of that mess alive harry grabbed a large shirt from her wardrobe one that upon further inspection was actually fred but had probably been sorted incorrectly by mrs weasley and put away with ginny things and gently tugged it over her head he looked around her bedroom and found her hairbrush he worked the brush through her hair softly working out the tangles pulling it back out of her face she leaned into his touch and for a moment she focused on something other than the pain in her body it was nice to have someone taking care of her in such a way harry lovingly brushed the hair out of her eyes and ginny sighed contentedly i sorry about what i said harry whispered i know she whispered back it was the truth from time to time everyone said things they didntmean but harry had just shown her how sorry he was how much he hadntmeant what he said forgive and forget her mother had once said perhaps she would never forget what harry said to her but she could forgive she did forgive i love you really i do i know she said and i love you harry grinned yeah i know but it good to finally hear you say it he kissed her softly then and ginny wanted to wrap her arms around him but it hurt to move so she opted to stay still instead are you ready to go ginny nodded and harry picked her up again walking out of the room and down the rest of the flights of stairs sometimes ginny reflected you had to stand on your own two feet sometimes though it was best to just give in and let your boyfriend take care of you harry wasntvery good at waiting obviously but he found it was easier to do it this time because he had been allowed to sit beside ginny as she slept he didntknow when she would awake but he wasntin a hurry she had been asleep for four hours after taking six different potions and wasntshowing any signs of waking any time soon merlin he was so in love with her it wasnt love really it was something else there had to be a word stronger than that to describe what he felt for her maybe he d just have to invent one harry yawned and shifted in his chair he had only gotten a few hours of sleep if that it was only catching up with him now he leaned forward and rested his head on ginny bed knowing that he shouldntfall asleep he slept he awoke to ginny tapping him lightly he sat up and felt pain shoot down his neck and back ginny was sitting up in bed and staring at him smiling slightly sorry she said i didntwant you to get a stiff neck harry cracked his neck how re you feeling the potions are helping me sleep i suppose said ginny but it still hurts like hell harry frowned and nodded arentyou going to come up here with me harry stared at her what if your mum comes in or one of the healers mum a little preoccupied at the moment ginny said blankly and no healer is going to kick harry potter out of my bed ginny shifted over making room for him and harry didntreally see a reason why he shouldntjust get in bed with her it wasntas if they were going to do anything inappropriate they were in a hospital after all if he was perfectly honest with himself he wanted to hold her more than anything in that second he settled onto the mattress and immediately ginny was against him resting her head against his chest though he knew it couldntbe comfortable in her current state do you think ron is okay ginny asked after a few moments harry wasntcaught off guard by this question he had been wondering the same thing i dontknow he said because what else could he tell her he couldntlie i hope so everyone at headquarters looking for him right now she continued they ll find him soon he closed his eyes and bit his lip right she asked almost as an afterthought right harry agreed his throat feeling dry he didnthave the heart to tell her about what he had heard between voldemort and lestrange the night before he would tell mcgonagall later but he couldnttell ginny it would be best if she didntknow at least for right now right ginny repeated and harry didntmiss the doubt in her voice i worried about hermione so am i do you think she ll i mean what if ron harry shushed her we shouldntbe thinking about that right now they fell silent again and harry could hardly believe everything that had happened in the last twenty four hours just yesterday at this time he was getting dressed for bill wedding he was trying to decide what to do about ginny merlin he was daft he had almost lost her so many times and she kept forgiving him why did she do that why didntshe just throw up her hands and give up on him already he had given her plenty of opportunities to hate him he wouldnteven be able to blame her if she did he counted his lucky stars that she loved him because he would be nothing without her whenever she was around he felt a strange sort of power of protectiveness of strength it had everything to do with ginny with her feelings for him and his feelings for her the thought that he had tried to end things with her was laughable his feelings for her hadntgone away while he was at privet drive and he doubted that they ever would if he walked away from her right now and never looked back she would be on his mind every second of every minute of every day and he would never stop loving her he hated himself because he was stupid because he tried to give her up as if she was an addiction she wasnta well she was an addiction but she was the best kind she was one habit he didnt want to break ginny took a deep breath about um what happened at the wedding i was an idiot said harry i thought that i was protecting you but i wasn t i was so bloody stupid i dontwant to be stupid anymore gin i done letting you down and i done letting myself down i done being noble he had never felt so open and honest so exposed and he briefly wondered what ginny would say she had told him she loved him but what if she had changed her mind what if she had thought about it over the past few hours and decided that he wasntworth the risk or that he wasntworth the heartache good said ginny but this is it you know there no going back now i know harry said firmly this is for life for life harry didntsee a problem with that honestly mm you have no idea how long i ve waited for you to say that ginny said dreamily her face nuzzled against his chest i wish i had done it sooner harry said and it was true ginny had always loved him and the fact that he couldntsay the same hurt him in a way he didntquite understand he wondered if it matted to her he wondered if she cared that he had ignored her for nearly six years of course she did she had to this thought bothered harry more than anything else he wondered if she thought he hadntcared about her back then he wondered if she ever thought of their past if she ever resented him for only seeing her as ron sister harry had a random thought so he said breaking the silence it s er it what it your birthday harry said softly and he felt ginny stiffen shite sorry i shouldnthave said anything no ginny said after a moment no that okay harry who knows maybe everything will be okay once we get back home that would be the best birthday gift i could ever ask for harry prayed to anyone he thought would listen that everything would turn out okay ginny sat up sighed and looked on as the resident healer attending to her left to get more potions for her to drink she had to admit the care at st mungo was better than she had expected healers were coming in and out of her room to check on her all the time but perhaps that was just because harry potter was with her she had never realized how much attention harry always got everywhere he went it wasntas if people just whispered behind his back or did other less obvious things they would squeal and gasp sometimes even blatantly stare or come up to him and ask for his autograph colin had practically been in love with harry all through hogwarts in first year after colin found out that harry had spent the summer at ginny house she had to answer millions of questions about what harry pajamas looked like she realized that she was feeling sorry for him so she shook her head to clear it because if there was one thing that harry didntlike it was being pitied does it hurt asked harry i mean as much as before ginny wanted to scream yes now go get the bloody healer and bring him back here so he can do his job and heal me but she bit her tongue forced herself to shake her head and said no i feeling a bit better actually harry frowned and stood from the chair at her bedside he had left her alone in the bed once the healers started to come into her room again really gin i wish you wouldntlie ginny smiled in spite of herself harry reached out and brushed the hair off her shoulders his eyes locked with hers and his expression changed ever so slightly what wrong asked ginny i said harry he took her hair in his hands and gave her a puzzled expression is your hair falling out it seems thinner than normal ginny gave him a strange look but grabbed at her hair she gasped and looked up at him it feels thinner over here do you think harry nodded there definitely some missing she said but it hasntbeen falling out then how ginny closed her eyes for a moment and gulped shite she was in serious trouble i think i remember lestrange taking some of my hair ginny said slowly i was too out of it at the time but harry cursed i thought i noticed it when i brushed your hair before but i never he cursed again do you know what this means they re they re making a polyjuice potion said ginny what am i going to do disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty three the man it was two and a half weeks seventeen days later when they were all called to the kitchen of grimmauld place probably about to give up on the search it hadntbeen long enough harry knew that if they would only keep looking even for just a few more days that they would find ron he was sure of it but they had already dedicated the last seventeen days to looking for ron they had hardly slept hardly eaten hardly done anything other than wandering spell after wandering spell raid after raid harry head was still spinning they had put ads in the daily prophet harry hermione and the weasleys had done interview after interview after interview he was seriously considering crawling to the minister and asking for his help in exchange for harry endorsements they had put off everything bill honeymoon the hunt for horcruxes but they hadntcome up with anything yet they had searched malfoy manor but found nothing the malfoys were on the run wanted just as sirius had been wherever the death eaters had relocated to they must have taken ron with them there were no leads that didntmean they wouldnteventually find something harry told himself daily the search couldntbe over it just couldntbe they couldntbe giving up not on ron but they were harry could tell by the look on mcgonagall face mcgonagall cleared her throat and harry tightened his grip on ginny his ex professor had tears in her eyes they were running down her cheeks actually mcgonagall was crying and it was the first time that harry had ever seen her so open and honest about her emotions it made him feel uneasy even more than he already did security had been increased tenfold around the burrow and headquarters since polyjuicing ginny had become a possibility for the other side mr weasley was enforcing more security measures including more passwords than ever before but nobody was complaining much this time around harry had dug out the book hermione had given him for his birthday defense against the dark arts volume iv ancient curses and how to deflect them and lupin had used it in conjunction with other various spells to put some sort of protective seal around ginny this way they couldnt do anything funny to her as he d explained to harry and harry hated this they were starting to make ginny change her appearance it had started out subtly enough she had to wear a sort of tracking bracelet on her arm that she wasntsupposed to take off now though she had gotten a haircut her hair now came to her shoulders and while it still looked brilliant harry knew that ginny hated it and she was now sporting a few blonde highlights mr weasley had even discussed bringing home some muggle contact lenses to change her eye colour but mcgonagall had said that they had changed enough for the moment harry thought that all of this was rather unnecessary as he hadntreally let ginny out of his sight since she d been back according to mcgonagall the way a polyjuice potion worked was that it only made the brewer look the way the person did when the hair had been taken from them basically whoever was trying to be ginny would still have totally red hair down to the middle of her back nobody knew at this point in time how long ginny would have to continue to alter her appearance their side had no idea how many hairs had been taken or when they were going to be used ginny was shaking in harry arms not taking her eyes off mcgonagall she had spent three days in st mungo before being released back home to the burrow for a week after that she was still experiencing some pain and discomfort but she hadntlet it stop her from going to headquarters and trying to find ron she had even done a few wandering spells though harry and hermione did most of them whenever they could ginny was fully recovered now physically though harry occasionally saw the shadow of something in her eyes and he wondered how long it would be until she was fully healed perhaps she never would be he didntknow but he knew that finding ron would help a great deal hermione was sandwiched between fred and george who surprisingly had hardly let the girl out of their sight in the past two weeks the twins had put their assistant verity in charge of the shop and hadntleft headquarters in a week the entire weasley family plus harry and hermione had been living out of grimmauld place actually harry didntlike it because it reminded him of fifth year when sirius and ron were with him and everything was simple but it was better than the alternative which was going back to the burrow and sleeping in ron bedroom by himself trying to fall asleep to the sound of the ghoul in the attic instead of ron loud even snores in a way harry could sympathize with hermione parents really they hadntspent any quality time with her since last christmas if his parents were still alive and he was spending all of his time with another family they d probably be a little ruffled by it too they had redeemed themselves in a way clearly they were aware of the turmoil at the burrow because they hadntstayed long in fact they d left right before ginny had gone to st mungo s hermione had hugged them and thanked them for understanding that she needed to stay though her tone was distant and cool her mother only asked that hermione contacted them as soon as she was ready to come home harry would never be sure but once they had left he thought he heard hermione mutter donthold your breath yesterday afternoon mcgonagall began and harry unconsciously held in his breath before leaving headquarters kingsley shacklebolt did one final wandering spell what he saw was well we were hoping that it wasnttrue but after careful investigations and a few more spells we have determined that it was in fact true harry tried hard to listen he really did but nothing that anyone said was sinking in all he could think about was what giving up this search meant for ron and for everyone else this was the end of the world honestly it was ginny squeezed harry hand tightly painfully and it brought him back to reality i so sorry kingsley was saying but it true ron is he gone you re wrong said hermione i cantimagine how difficult this must be kingsley said softly hermione dear i saw it with my own two eyes well you saw wrong kingsley bowed his head apologetically and took a step back clearly unwilling to argue with hermione he in a better place now harry heard lupin say his tone soft and comforting something like a father would be harry imagined but was it really a better place ron wasntwith harry or ginny or hermione so really how great could it be he looked around the room and couldntquite make out anything everything had gone blurry and harry would ve thought that he was crying if he hadntknown better truthfully harry didnteven think he was capable of crying anymore when sirius died harry had thrown things around and practically destroyed dumbledore office it made him feel just the slightest bit better and it gave him answers to questions he hadnteven asked answers about the prophecy and voldemort about harry purpose and role in the war he had shed a few tears at dumbledore funeral but where had that gotten him he had only felt worse he had come close to crying for ginny he had come close to completely breaking down over her and it wouldnthave helped in the least no he couldntcry for ron crying made it real crying was basically saying ron is dead and i accept that you shut up whispered hermione leaning into fred you didntsee anything there was nothing to see i i watched it all kingsley said speaking more to arthur than anyone else now the avada kedavra one of the death eaters did it i couldnttell who it was he didntsuffer kingsley added as if that actually meant something as if ron being dead was somehow easier because he hadntsuffered harry wanted to laugh at this but all that came out was a choking wheezing sound that he didnteven know he could make if he was perfectly honest with himself he would admit that in the past he had dreams no nightmares in which ron was dying at his side fighting the brave fight dignified and heroic while these nightmares had been awful they would ve been better than the truth ron died alone and who knows where probably tortured and without a wand while harry was back home safe and sound at headquarters or the burrow it didntseem fair and if harry thought that it would make even the slightest of differences he would offer himself up to the death eaters in a second we need to do more said harry after a minute he had never before realized just how long a minute was one minute sixty seconds could make a world of difference one minute harry was dancing with ginny at the wedding and the next they were all being attacked one minute harry was sure that everything was going to be okay and the next ron was gone one minute harry was agonizing over where his best friend could be and then next his best friend was dead and gone and never coming back in a single minute people were born and people were dying people laughed cried smiled and frowned and it didntreally matter in the grand scheme of things because the next minute would only bring the winds of change we need to at least get his body we need to bring it back or something we we just need to do more perhaps it had been more than a minute since they d gotten the news actually because harry realized that everyone with red hair except for ginny had disappeared somewhere somewhere to his left hermione sniffed in his arms ginny buried her face in his chest and sobbed the sound cutting through the air like a knife mcgonagall sniffed i i am so sorry harry harry she had said and it made him shudder because it wasnt right because mcgonagall only called him potter because ron was actually alive because dumbledore couldnthave been killed in june because although snape was a bastard he couldnthave been the one to do it because everything was still okay it just bloody had to be harry shrugged at mcgonagall words and dropped his gaze to the floor ignoring lupin attempts to catch his eye ignoring hermione insistent tone when she said that ron was alive and that they were all misinformed ignoring everything but the feel of ginny in his arms of knowing that she was in unbelievable pain of knowing that he had caused it later she would say it wasnthis fault and he would want to believe it maybe he would believe it maybe it really wasnthis fault he didntknow he probably never would he had no bloody idea about anything anymore but did it matter did it bring ron back harry remembered the conversation he had had with ron before everything had gone to hell harry remembered what he had promised he wanted to keep that promise he wanted to give hermione the message the one that he and ron had arranged to be given to either hermione or ginny in the event of an accident he really did she should know he reasoned but ron was gone hermione was not and harry had to think about which was worse betraying a deceased friend or hurting one who was still alive and could still feel all of the raw painful emotions that had been dished out to them harry sighed hermione deserved to know he would want ginny to know if it had been him and he was pretty sure that if it had been him ginny would want to know too but hermione and ginny were different could hermione handle it she wasntas strong as ginny harry shook his head hermione was one of the strongest people he knew the fact that she hadntshriveled up and died proved how tough she was how thick her skin was one day when the time was right hermione would know but until then harry would have to figure out a way to let her know how much ron cared about her without actually having to tell her he had no idea how he was going to do that though we cannot do any more than we already have said mcgonagall you know that really the only thing harry knew for sure was that if the roles had been reversed ron never would have given up on him we cannot do any more than we already have mcgonagall was saying you know that a wave of desperation swept over hermione as she shook her head refusing to admit that ron was dead it was one thing to have gone the past two and a half weeks without him unsure that he would come back it was an entirely different thing to give up hoping to accept that he was gone but what could she do if they said that ron was gone then ron was gone ron was dead it sounded so harsh so final that hermione couldntstand it death was so permanent so irreversible that it was as if she was losing ron all over again why hadntshe realized this before sirius had died dumbledore had died so many had died but none of them had been ron it had never mattered so much before this wasntlike getting a bad mark on an essay though she d never actually experienced this personally hermione couldntmake up for it next time there was no next time hermione would never look into his blue eyes again her heart would never again skip a beat when he walked into the room she would never get to say goodbye to tell him that she loved him more than anything and that if she could she would trade places with him in a second hadntshe told him not to go hadntshe begged him to stay behind with her stupid ron stupid noble ron it wasntfair that she loved him he was so unpredictable so completely and totally different from her he didntthink things through before he acted he was rude he swore he liked quidditch and hated studying and he definitely hated s p e w but when you got right down to it how different had they really been they were both stubborn and difficult they both fought alongside harry every chance they could they were both passionate people they never backed down from a challenge they had both made mistakes some big like lavender and some small like victor krum but mistakes nonetheless hermione wanted to be angry with ron for leaving for going off to fight it was easier not to feel the pain if you could focus on all the rage but she couldn t because she would ve done the same thing if she could have they fought but it was only because they were so similar it was because they were the same in so many aspects that was killing hermione inside she and ron were soul mates they had to be and now he was dead she didntknow how long she stood there listening to the sound of ginny tears listening to the sound of her own she was tired and wanted to sleep but it didntseem fair somehow because ron would never get to sleep again she found the rest of the weasleys and after many long emotionally exhausting hours they all climbed the stairs and went to their bedrooms at headquarters hermione was sharing a room with ginny they exchanged quick half hearted hugs before getting in their beds it hadnttruly caught up with hermione yet and if she knew anything about the girl in the bed next to hers it hadntcaught up to ginny either hermione awoke sometime in the middle of the night she sighed and got out of bed tiptoeing across the room to the door harry mumbled something in his sleep and hermione froze but he quickly dozed off again each night harry slept in ginny bed and although hermione felt certain mrs weasley disapproved she never said anything to either of them about it hermione floo d to the burrow and sat down at the kitchen table in the spot ron used to occupy she didntknow why she did it she hadntmeant to leave headquarters she was probably breaking about a thousand different rules it was as if she was under some sort of imperius curse except she could still feel the pain she sighed how could this happen how could ron be dead she d promised him once that she would never leave him he had never promised her the same but he wouldntdare leave her not after what he d said i love you he had meant it hadnthe he hadntpromised her personally that he d always be with her but maybe he d promised himself maybe he d meant to promise her and simply hadntgotten around to it it was a possibility wasntit she looked up at the clock ten hands including hers were pointed at mortal peril but one ron was pointed at lost she felt something catch in her throat and her heart lifted slightly she knew then she understood better than she had ever understood something before that ron was alive ron was alive she smiled and climbed the stairs to ron bedroom it was cold and dusty nobody had stepped foot in it for weeks she crawled into his bed and sniffed the pillow even though it didntreally smell like ron anymore this didntbother her in a way it would have an hour ago ron would come back eventually and when he did the first place he would go would be his bedroom hermione would be waiting for him and even he didntstay long even if he didn t for some reason bother to tell anyone that he was back even if he went back to wherever he was now without so much as leaving a note it would be okay because hermione would go with him wherever he wanted a man squinted against the rain and watched as his friend joe someone the man had met only five days ago but was the closest thing to a friend that the man had in this strange place rushed toward him holding a newspaper the man sighed and ran a hand through his short black hair he didntnaturally have black hair though he was altering his appearance with a spell that joe had taught him he didntask how joe knew of such a spell or why he seemed so good at putting it into practice he naturally had bright flaming red hair and he had freckles but it was easier to just do a simple spell and get rid of everything that made him stand out nobody took notice to the tall dark stranger everybody noticed a man with bright red hair and obnoxious freckles the man didntfancy getting asked questions mostly because he couldntanswer any of their questions he couldnteven answer his own hey called joe joe was the only other person who around this area who didntspeak with a clear american accent the man didntspeak like the rest of them his accent was british and he wondered if maybe he had lived there once but joe had traces of the same accent and he said he had never even been near europe the man grunted in response what is it joe wordlessly handed him the paper and the man eyes skimmed the front page which was spattered with raindrops another death eater attack asked the man joe nodded his eyes oddly sparkling yeah they never stop over in england it seems muggles this one was the man sighed turn to page five said joe after a moment with a tone that the man couldntquite figure out the man turned to page five and his eyes were immediately drawn to the picture who is that he asked urgently he knew her but from where maybe he thought if he could contact her she would be able to fill him in on his past maybe she would help him discover why certain parts of his memory were gone or maybe he was just desperate for a link to his past and he was tricking himself into believing he knew the beautiful girl on page five he certainly wished that he knew the beautiful girl on page five every other bloke probably did too but the way her curly brown hair cascaded down her back the way she kept her shoulders back and her chin high even though she was clearly grieving in the picture the way she wrung her hands and worried her lip there was something about her that he knew it was on the tip of his tongue who knows said joe dismissively but she awful pretty she looks a little sad though i wouldntmind cheering her up you know give her the old the man felt his fist clench and he looked up from the paper donttalk about her like that he spat joe stared at the man with a startled expression for several seconds do you um know her he asked in a measured voice the man sighed no he admitted realizing how foolish he sounded in his own head joe seemed to relax but still yeah you re right there no damn point she too close with that harry potter lucky bloke he probably the man didnthear the rest of joe sentence because he walked away taking the newspaper with him he tried to read the article attached to the pretty girl picture the man shook his head in frustration and tossed the paper in a nearby rubbish bin the rain had soaked through and the ink had run across the page there was no way he would be able to read the article was it really worth it anyway he wondered where he knew the girl from but if what joe had said was true she was friends with harry potter perhaps he only knew her because she was famous too he imagined the picture of her in his mind again joe had been right she looked sad he wondered what could make her feel that way and then laughed aloud what did he care he wasntabout to solve anyone else problems he had his own to deal with disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty four the funeral the first of september for the very first time in centuries did not bring the start of a new term at hogwarts instead it brought ron funeral the only thing harder than losing ron in harry opinion was seeing what it did to mrs weasley and ginny they sobbed through the entire ceremony which was held in a small cemetery where harry had never been before they didnthave a body but they had a headstone and it was the best anyone could do for ronald weasley that thought was like a knife in harry side after all that ron had done for him after all the laughs and quidditch games and chocolate frogs harry couldnteven track down his best mate corpse to give him a proper burial hermione squeezed harry hand and he looked down at her unable to figure her out she had gone from absolutely miserable to somewhat cheery and harry didntunderstand why she had been a wreck ever since ron had disappeared the day they were told of ron demise hermione had wept for him but the next morning she was smiling her eyes were twinkling much like they had done before this whole mess it okay to cry harry told her because it was really the only thing he could tell her as he held a sobbing ginny in his arms hermione leaned in can i tell you something harry she whispered harry nodded you can tell me anything i know but if i tell you this you have to promise that you wontthink i crazy you have to try to understand she said her eyes were pleading with him for some sort of support so he nodded and promised ron isntdead she said with a small smile for a long time harry didntknow how to respond he d told hermione that he wouldntwrite her off as crazy but well she certainly seemed nutters harry knew what was going on hermione was in denial he had experienced it when sirius died and again with professor dumbledore but it was important for his friend to realize that ron was really gone perhaps it would hurt but it would be for the best wouldntit hermione he whispered he is dead ron is dead hermione shook her head her eyes flashing in anger you promised that you d try to understand she hissed ron isntdead i know he isn t harry couldnthelp himself he felt a small thrill of hope spawn in the pit of his stomach what do you mean how i cantexplain it said hermione and harry felt the hope vanish at once this was hermione she usually didntmake a move until she had checked and re checked every single fact in at least three different books was she actually unable to explain how she knew that ron was alive i just know i can feel it she really didnthave any true reason she didnthave facts and evidence to support her theories she didnthave long school length essays written out on the subject hermione was going by a feeling this was crazy please tell me that i the only one you ve told about this harry said well i was going to tell mrs weasley before this funeral but i thought you should know first she said squinting in confusion but i going to tell mcgonagall as soon as this is over harry shook his head you cantdo that he said quickly hermione frowned why not because he whispered his eyes scanning the area to make sure that none of the weasleys were listening to hermione desperate attempt to hold on to ron look at mrs weasley look at how upset she is yes and knowing that her son is alive and well will make her feel better hermione argued if nobody knows that ron is alive how will we be able to look for him you cantjust go tell mrs weasley that her son is alive without any proof harry said marveling at the fact that he was for once being the logical one you cantgive her that hope and then take it away who said anything about taking it away questioned hermione ronald weasley is alive i can feel it harry i can feel it in here she said putting a hand over her heart and if after all we ve been through that isntgood enough for you then then what hermione didntanswer instead she turned around and walked away mcgonagall approached harry a few minutes later before he had the change to go find hermione and convince her not to talk to mrs weasley about ron may i have a word requested mcgonagall harry nodded and followed her down a twisting path keeping his eyes glued to the ground underfoot what do you need professor he felt a bit silly calling her professor especially since as of today it was clear that hogwarts would not open and she would not be his professor any longer if mcgonagall noticed though she did not mention it you have been reinstated she said clearly wasting no time i have come to realize that perhaps it was slightly foolish of me to force you out of the order harry met her eyes um thanks he said lamely but i not going to come back to the order potter no he said i ve given it a lot of thought and maybe the order just isntfor me well that is your choice of course yeah harry sighed looking out across the cemetery you know i not even supposed to be here is that so asked mcgonagall uh huh we were supposed to well it doesnteven matter what we were supposed to do it was going to be the three of us just like always you remember professor we always managed to get into trouble when we were together he said but somehow everything always ended up okay for us didntit yes it did indeed harry laughed harshly this summer was supposed to be different it was supposed to be better ron and hermione were supposed to finally get together you know he paused at this part hardly able to bear the wistful feeling that arose inside himself we were supposed to fight voldemort and the bloody death eaters on our terms and damn it i thought we might even win and then after it was all over and voldemort was gone we were going to come home the three of us were ginny was going to be waiting for me and everything was going to be okay again nobody else was going to die you were going to open hogwarts and and it was just going to be good for once he felt professor mcgonagall arm on his shoulder for a brief moment before he turned to look out into the horizon the sun was setting and harry sighed remembering how he and ron used to play quidditch in the backyard as the sun set behind them sometimes listening when hermione demanded that they come inside before it got too dark sometimes not sometimes even they d convince hermione to join them for a fly why cantthings ever just be good you have the power to make things good she said softly your magic is growing stronger do you feel it harry did feel it but he couldntbring himself to care very much i would like for you to train with me mcgonagall said i can teach you to use your power you have already exhibited amazing skill you have excelled in your defense against the dark arts classes your wandless magic is especially strong remus lupin tells me that you took out half the death eaters at malfoy manor with your wandless abilities he also says that you saved the day at the wedding yeah but i didntkill anyone mcgonagall paused for a moment do you want to kill them harry harry had thought long and hard about this and yes he wanted to see everyone from the other side dead but not only that he wanted to be the one to kill them every last one of them harry told her his stomach churning he remembered the first time he met professor mcgonagall and frowned because he had been so innocent and so optimistic and now he was reaching inside of his robes to grip his wand the wand he would gladly use to murder anyone who crossed his path i suppose that makes me just as bad as voldemort lord voldemort and his followers kill because it makes them feel powerful she said does the thought of taking another life make you feel that way it makes me feel like shite he admitted but a part of me feels good about it and it scary a part of me wants to do it wants to see them cry out in pain and beg me for their lives is this regarding what happened to miss weasley harry shook his head this isntabout ginny this this is about ron he said mr weasley would not have wanted you to become a murderer for him mcgonagall said softly and harry nodded i know but if i had been to one to to die d you honestly think ron would ve sat around twiddling his thumbs certainly not but is violence the answer they killed ron he said feeling frustrated that someone as smart as mcgonagall couldntunderstand his need to avenge his best friend they killed ron and i going to kill them they did not all kill mr weasley she said they certainly didntsave him though i did not save him miss granger and miss weasley did not save him either she said are you going to kill us as well harry laughed at this because it was ridiculous that he was having this conversation with mcgonagall it was ridiculous that they were at ron funeral it was ridiculous that hermione the most logical person harry had ever known thought ron was alive when he was clearly dead harry turned and met mcgonagall eyes again if snape was here he said if he was here right now standing in front of you just as i am would you do it would you raise your wand and kill him potter he killed professor dumbledore he pointed his wand and killed the greatest wizard alive without a second bloody thought does snape deserve mercy no would you kill him would you do it for dumbledore there was no answer would you yes mcgonagall whispered and harry unconsciously took a step back there he said knowing that he was probably staring at her in shock but suddenly felt unable to rearrange his face you would kill snape because he killed dumbledore it not any different that me killing someone else on that side it is different she argued because i am old and responsible for my actions i responsible for mine too you are a child she continued as if he hadntspoken you should not be forced into deciding whether or not someone deserves to live you should not be forced to take another life well isntthat a double edged sword professor am i not the one who has to kill voldemort he asked mcgonagall said nothing and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives why is it okay for me to kill voldemort because i harry potter and i have to but it isntokay for me to kill the rest simply because i harry and my best friend is ron and he was killed by one of them mcgonagall looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly together i will not teach you to kill she said but i will teach you to harness your wandless magic so you can do any spell you chose to and and it is not up to me to decide which spells they will be my wandless magic it isntas significant as you make it out to be harry said feeling self conscious and slightly frightened by the fact that mcgonagall had sort of given him permission to commit murder i cantdecide when to use it anyway it just sort of comes and goes i dontthink it something that i ll ever be able to er harness as you said perhaps mcgonagall said slowly as though considering this but it is worth a try surely you have noticed strange things happening around us lately harry almost grinned i can do magic tell me one thing about that sentence that doesntseem strange stranger things than usual then mcgonagall corrected herself how d you mean take the disappearance of mr ollivander for example okay um well i suppose it is an awfully large mystery now that you mention it there is no mystery involved mcgonagall said darkly voldemort has ollivander and all of the others i am sure of this and do you know why er no admitted harry your wand is the brother to lord voldemort wand correct asked mcgonagall harry nodded so you think that voldemort having ollivander make him a new wand a wand he can use against me without it going all funny like it is a possibility which is what makes your wandless magic so much more important lord voldemort will be able to use his wand against you in ways he is not currently able to she explained but you will be able to use your mind against him in ways you are not currently able to harry shrugged ron seemed to think that my wandless magic was a big deal harry said unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice he said it was wicked he said that i could do some great things but what the point in doing great things if you canteven save your best mate you can prevent this from happening again to someone you love she offered gently regardless of your feelings i feel it is important that you train with me please say that you will consider it harry sighed i ll consider it thank you mcgonagall said she inhaled and looked back up at him i cannot pretend that i understand what you are feeling right now harry because i do not ronald weasley was you re right you dontunderstand harry said sharply nobody does now if you ll excuse me i have to go find hermione because she the only other person who could possibly understand but for some reason she refuses to accept the simple fact that our best mate is never coming home he trudged away from mcgonagall unsure of why he lashed out at her but knowing that it had everything to do with his hermione and ron shattered friendship i think i going to go take a walk ginny told angelina do you want me to come with you ginny shook her head no i ll be okay you should go find fred she offered angelina hesitated for a moment before leaving to go find her boyfriend ginny head was buzzing as she set off down one of the worn in paths and looked around there were so many graves so many people buried in this cold hard ground and her brother was one of them now no he wasn t because they didntfind his body ginny shivered not wanting to think about what those bastards had done with ron body the word inferius came to mind ginny knew that what happened to ron wasnther fault she had to believe it for several reasons she d go crazy if she thought that she was responsible for her favourite brother death she wouldntbe able to look her mother in the eye there was nothing she could do anyway she couldnthelp that lucius malfoy had given her a diary when she was eleven and voldemort was after her now it wasntas if she d known when she had gone to the pond during the wedding that she was giving malfoy and lestrange the perfect opportunity to snatch her besides she couldntkeep telling harry it wasnthis fault that it was the death eaters faults if she really thought it was hers a part of her wished that she hadntbeen so close with ron though if they had fought more if they hadntalways hung around each other at hogwarts maybe it would ve been easier to deal with his death but then again it might have been harder she might have wished that they had been closer really in a situation such as this there was no middle ground to grief do you want to kill them harry ginny nearly jumped when she heard professor mcgonagall speak she hadntrealized that she was close to them she knew that mcgonagall had wanted to talk to harry in private she knew that she should go every last one of them ginny felt her knees go weak i suppose that makes me just as bad as voldemort said harry ginny shook her head at this though he couldntsee her harry would never be anything like voldemort lord voldemort and his followers kill because it makes them feel powerful does the thought of taking another life make you feel that way asked mcgonagall ginny crept closer and a branch snapped under her foot she winced and held her breath hoping they hadntheard her when their conversation was not interrupted ginny exhaled in relief and sat down on a nearby tree stump it makes me feel like shite but a part of me feels good about it and it scary said harry a part of me wants to do it wants to see them cry out in pain and beg me for their lives she could hear the pain in his voice and wanted to go to him but knew that she couldntbecause she wasnteven supposed to hear this conversation is this regarding what happened to miss weasley ginny wanted to cry at the thought that she had roused this sort of hatred inside of harry this isntabout ginny he said and she was almost too relieved to hear what he said next this this is about ron mr weasley would not have wanted you to become a murderer for him said mcgonagall i know harry said but if i had been to one to to die d you honestly think ron would ve sat around twiddling his thumbs certainly not was mcgonagall answer but is violence the answer ginny shook her head and prayed that harry would come to his senses and quit talking about wanting to kill people they killed ron said harry as if this explained everything which it did not they killed ron and i going to kill them they did not all kill mr weasley mcgonagall said reasonably they certainly didntsave him though harry countered i did not save him miss granger and miss weasley did not save him either are you going to kill us as well she heard harry laugh and wished that she had picked a different spot to eavesdrop because she couldntsee his face from where she currently was if snape was here if he was here right now standing in front of you just as i am would you do it would you raise your wand and kill him harry asked and ginny felt her heart plummet into her stomach potter ginny felt hope at mcgonagall annoyed tone mcgonagall would be logical about this she would talk harry out of going after snape he killed professor dumbledore harry exclaimed he pointed his wand and killed the greatest wizard alive without a second bloody thought oh harry ginny whispered he was so wrong about everything does snape deserve mercy harry demanded yes ginny thought he deserves mercy because you dontbloody know the facts you re condemning him for no reason no was professor mcgonagall reply ginny gasped and sat up a little straighter would you kill him questioned harry would you do it for dumbledore mcgonagall didntanswer right away so harry prodded would you yes mcgonagall said in a hard voice that made ginny worried so worried in fact that she found herself on her feet and about to scream at them then she remembered her promise and shut her mouth she owed snape her life and all she had been able to give him in return was her word she wasntabout to go back on that get away from me ginny demands but he doesntmove quiet weasley he orders glaring at her just as he did throughout five years of potions classes there is no time listen carefully why should i listen to anything you have to say you you killed professor dumbledore shut up snape says sharply and ginny sees a flicker of something in his eyes i am not going to help you if you continue to act like a brat ginny is momentarily deflected by this you re helping me she asks but you re on their side i am not on any side you will do well to remember that i okay fine says ginny because what else can she say to that but still you hate me dontyou yes he says simply and then turns away from her he holds out his hand to silence her for a minute his features twisted in concentration as if he is listening for something like i said before he continues after a moment we do not have much time if you are ever going to get out of here you will need to trust me can you do that no ginny says truthfully i ll try though very well he says i dontget this you say you re going to help me why didntyou just stay away from me in the first place that would ve helped me a lot just because i am not on a side does not mean i want either side knowing that ginny felt her brow furrow in confusion that doesntmake sense yes it does he says in a cool tone are you through asking idiotic questions for now she says hesitantly because even though he claims that he going to help her she knows she canttrust him snape hates her he hates her family harry and hermione he has no reason to want to help her you will of course need to do something for me in exchange he tells her of course she says dryly she should have seen this coming what is it i never pegged you for the pervert type you know snape stares at her sorry she says suddenly uncomfortable under his gaze he smirks merlin she loathes him it is a simple request one i believe even you can manage ginny watches him intently if you get out of this alive he says and ginny doesntappreciate the way he says if you are not to tell anyone that i helped you especially potter ginny doesntunderstand why harry will kill you if he ever gets the chance to if i tell him then i do not need any favours snape says darkly harry potter and i are not nor will we ever be on the same side he thinks that i murdered professor dumbledore you did ginny mutters and if he chooses to come after me to challenge me then we will duel like men he concludes ignoring her ginny has to ask are you afraid of harry do not make me laugh snape says you think too highly of your little boyfriend he sounds revolted but ginny cantbe sure if he is sincerely unconcerned or if he is simply a brilliant actor he played the order like a fiddle for years perhaps he is just that good how are you going to help me she asks you must promise first he says promise that you will not tell anyone i promise she says wondering what the big deal is she wonders if he realizes that this promise means virtually nothing to her we need a third party to make an unbreakable vow he says so i suppose i will have to take you at your word ginny nods because she doesntreally know what an unbreakable vow is she remembers fred and george trying to get ron to do one when they were all really little but that about it when you are asked of what happened here you are to tell them that i tortured you do you understand sure i understand ginny snapped out of it and hid as harry marched past her looking angry and confused she knew better than to follow him the man was reading a newspaper one that joe had handed him once he had finished with it there was an article on harry potter on the front page the man didntknow why he cared so much about this bloke to be honest so what if he had saved the wizarding world and so what if he might do it again was harry potter really that important maybe he was just some over celebrated sod maybe he wasntas great as he was cracked up to be maybe he wouldnteven survive this war for some reason the thought of harry potter dying tied the man stomach up in knots the man didntreally like thinking about the war and what it was doing to people all around the world but he found himself anticipating each day waiting for a newspaper waiting for a new article on what harry and his friends were doing the man would read and re read each story his heart jumping slightly each time a new name like arthur weasley or percy weasley was mentioned this time however the article didntmention those names the only one the man can identify other than harry potter of course is ginny weasley the article mentioned a deceased weasley but did not give a name and the man was unnerved to find that he was rather curious on the matter he wondered who these bloody weasley people were once there had been an article about a bill weasley and how his wedding had been ruined by some sort of attack the man didnt dontget killed harry tells him and then runs off to fight because that what harry does harry is the definition of hero and he wonders if harry knows it but harry is gone now and he must fend for himself his thoughts are of hermione wondering where she is and if she even knows what happening he hopes that she is safe that she is with ginny and they are out of harm way perhaps they will even be able to get help for the rest but then there is no time to think because he fighting and throwing out curses as if he isnthim as if he harry and it amazing and thrilling and he cantquite believe it he feels afraid but oddly capable as if this is finally his chance to prove himself as more than harry bumbling best mate he looks around and all he can you okay the man gasped and jumped back wrenching his arm out of the stranger grip it took the man a moment to come back to himself to recognize who he was looking at with a start he realized that he was expecting to see harry potter blazing green eyes instead of joe lighter coloured ones staring back at him whoa what was that asked joe the man was taking deep shaky breaths now he shook his head at his friend it was nothing it didntlook like nothing said joe he seemed nervous joe ran a hand through his curly blonde hair and eyed the man i fine said the man was he do you remember the first time we met hermione asked softly it was past midnight and only harry and hermione were still up thankfully harry had managed to talk hermione into keeping quiet about ron for the time being he had brought up the excellent point that mrs weasley was still fragile if she didntbelieve hermione then hermione would be in the wrong for telling a grieving mother that her dead son wasntreally dead when harry knew that he really was and if mrs weasley did believe hermione the shock combined with the stress of having a funeral for one of her children could do something funny to her harry nodded at hermione question of course he said it was on the train hermione smiled faintly and nodded as if she hadntexpected him to remember and was pleased that he actually did you came in asking if anybody had seen neville toad even back then you had to be on top of everything he laughed harry was starting to realize that it was okay to laugh ron his best friend in the whole bloody world was dead and would never laugh again but ron would want harry to keep laughing ron would want hermione to keep laughing so maybe even though it felt sort of wrong maybe it was okay to laugh at least in the privacy of each other company hermione chuckled but it sounded just a bit forced you must have thought i was the most annoying person in the world she said a hitch in her voice making her sound truly vulnerable for the third time since harry had known her the first being at the yule ball arguing with ron and the second being during herbology talking about the slug club christmas party with ron it seemed that everything always came back to ron in the end nah he said i thought you were nice a little intimidating how you fixed my glasses and all mind you but you were nice you thought i was intimidating she asked she tossed her head back and laughed for real this time you were a living legend sitting about five feet away from me eating a chocolate frog as if nothing had ever happened to you you were so fascinating good of you to watch me like some animal in an exhibit he said without malice but really i thought you were okay they fell silent for a moment the sorting hat tried to put me in ravenclaw said hermione harry sat up a little straighter in fact i remember being so pleased with that i had read in hogwarts a history harry snickered yes hermione said with a smile i read in there that ravenclaw was a very prestigious house only the brightest witches and wizards went there and it made me feel like maybe i belonged somewhere for once that maybe i had a place at hogwarts you always had a place harry said with us hermione met his eyes and nodded the hat changed its mind though i dontknow why really but i cantstop thinking about what things would be like harry sighed the hat put you in gryffindor because it knew that i would need you if i was ever going to live past first year you re right i did save your sorry butt a few times she laughed ron s too harry tensed sorry she whispered no dontbe sorry we should never feel sorry for thinking about ron for wanting to remember him maybe harry thought he could use this as an opportunity to make hermione see that ron was really dead a part of him was tempted to nod his head and agree with her to let himself believe that ron was alive and coming home any minute now but prolonging the realization that ron was gone forever would only hurt more in the end harry didntwant hermione to hurt any more than she already had to she sniffed and nodded he called me a nightmare she continued he hated me he didn t said harry if he had hated you he wouldnthave cared that you heard him call you that or that you ran off crying he sighed and put an arm around her ron was brave but at eleven years old there werentmany people he d go fight a mountain troll for he told me he loved me hermione whispered her eyes closing but then he grabbed the portkey and left oh was all harry could bring himself to say he left me even though he claimed to to love me she said bitterly part of me thinks he only said it to get me to let him go after ginny she confided that not true harry said instantly he told me right before we left i told him i loved ginny and he said it and he said it again before he well just before hermione smiled when i thought that ron was dead a part of me hated myself because i had wasted so much time fighting with him i had insulted him instead of telling him how i really felt i wished that i could just go back and do it over again but maybe when he gets back maybe we ll have a chance after all harry knew differently but he didnthave the heart to tell her that their chance had long since passed ginny rolled over and closed her eyes tightly attempting to fall asleep no matter how hard she tried though she just couldntclear her mind maybe she d need to start learning occlumency from harry how long have i been here she wonders aloud when snape returns there have been four different shifts of death eaters though there could ve been more perhaps she just passed out in this room since snape last left snape has come and gone twice since claiming he intended to help her each time leaving her more and more confused with the situation it feels like it has been days since she last saw harry at least ginny though weakly only one of those death eater shifts had included a round of the cruciatus curse she didntthink she could ve taken any more than she had been given i can help you get out of here safely or i can monitor a clock snape barks which would you prefer sorry ginny says she isntsorry not really but she figures that kissing snape arse will be the most effective way of getting him to willingly help her snape as usual ignores her may i ask you something she asks after a moment and she is almost unaware of her politeness at this point i daresay you will ask regardless of my answer he says and it the closest to a yes that ginny is ever going to get with him who are you loyal to i mean it not the order and i dontreally know if it voldemort do not say his name why shouldnti she asks genuinely curious it only a name after all snape does not answer she decides to switch tactics harry says you call him the dark lord i bet potter says a lot of things and you do not ever bother to look beyond what he tells you snape growls harry potter is god to you and voldemort is god to you you are annoying me he says and you are avoiding my questions she replies who are you loyal to snape spins around to look at her the swooshing of his robe creating a breeze and making her shiver or perhaps it is the look on his face that makes her shiver listen carefully because i will only say this once i am loyal to one person and one person only he says i am loyal to albus dumbledore now kindly stop pestering me because i have already given you more than you deserve ginny doesntsay anything partially because she has been ordered to keep quiet partially because she is weak and does not want to waste more energy talking and partially because she doesntknow what to say in response to snape comment but the look in snape eyes each time they speak about dumbledore really frightens her what do you mean something is wrong i dontknow lucius i dontunderstand it but he remembering everyday when i give him the paper and he reads about potter it has an affect on him he is asking me questions and i cantkeep avoiding the answers or he ll start getting suspicious his memory isntas damaged as we d hoped it would be when we obliviated it the curse we used wasntstrong enough i suppose you re sure that he remembering perhaps he is i know for certain that he is today when i was with him again he remembered something else i could tell by the look on his face he still doesnttrust joe enough to confide in him though well you re just going to have to work a little harder arentyou yes yes i know i will good if all else fails we might have to kill him however that is our last resort do everything you can to keep him in the state he in now yes but i dontunderstand why we didntdo away with him when we first got hold of him why not just blast him away instead of sending do not question the dark lord orders i not i merely wondering if it is smart to keep him as he is even from across the world he is still powerful he is still connected to potter and granger that granger girl is too smart she ll figure this out lucius perhaps and this is why we are working on separating her from potter as well and the weasley girl she ll have to go too once potter stands alone he will be easy to destroy that is true potter needs his friends but it will only be a matter of time before this one starts to remember then try to get us as much time as you can once the dark lord defeats potter it really doesntmatter what weasley remembers disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty five training and dumbledore what do you want me to do harry asked mcgonagall it was two days after ron funeral and harry first training session had just begun he had been instructed to floo to hogwarts bright and early though harry didntthink the term bright applied since the sun wasntreally out yet and meet mcgonagall in the great hall which had been emptied out it was strange being in hogwarts and harry wasntso sure that he d be able to attend many training sessions if they were all to be held here he made a mental note to ask mcgonagall if they could relocate harry stood over the place where the gryffindor table had been and tried not to think of all the mornings he had spent there wishing that he could have been somewhere else now harry would give anything to be back there he could almost hear the sounds of owls fluttering through the open windows delivering the mail he could almost hear ron loud booming voice as he talked excitedly about quidditch and hermione irritated tone as she lectured him about talking with his mouth full professor mcgonagall was walking in a circle around him and harry wondered if she noticed that she was doing so he wished that she d stop he had to turn with her to keep her in his sights and he was starting to get dizzy he stifled a yawn it was so bloody early he wouldnthave even bothered getting up if mrs weasley hadntcome into ginny room and woken him up herself that was awkward and even though harry didntparticularly want to be training now he was glad for an excuse not to be at the burrow ginny would no doubt be getting a lecture from her mum about why it wasntproper for a girl to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend when nobody else was there to make sure they behaved mrs weasley had known all along of ginny and harry sleeping arrangements of this harry was sure but it was only now since hermione refused to sleep anywhere but in ron bed that it was a real issue if harry knew one thing about ginny though it was that she was stubborn even more than ron had been if her mum told her that harry wasntallowed to sleep in her bed anymore well ginny wouldnttake that she d simply insist that they were responsible and that they werentdoing anything inappropriate until her mum saw reason and caved mrs weasley always seemed to have a weak spot when it came to ginny and harry and really why couldnt they share a bed if they werentdoing anything but sleeping of course they were doing a little more than sleeping they were doing things that they wouldntdo if hermione was sleeping in the next bed things that would probably land mrs weasley in st mungo s if she only knew and harry would be in right behind her because each and every one of ginny brothers would probably hex him into next week but it wasntas if they were shagging so why couldnt they put up a silencing charm and night and enjoy each other they were only doing what any other couple their age was doing the only difference was that harry might not live to see his next birthday and maybe if this was all he and ginny were ever going to get of each other they shouldntwaste it mcgonagall finally stopped moving around for today i would like to work on your wandless magic she said harry hadntthought he needed to tell her that he couldntcontrol his wandless magic and most of the time didnteven know when he was doing it but he did apparently um said harry how re we going to do that i mean it isntlike normal magic professor am i just going to wave my hands around and shout out spells until something actually happens he asked skeptically thinking that it sounded ridiculous and she had to see reason mcgonagall nodded yes she said pulling out her wand that is exactly what you are going to do harry was waiting for her to crack a smile to shake her head and tell him that she was kidding that there was another easier way to go about this but she didn t but a part of him expected it as he was beginning to learn no as he had always known but hadntbefore realized that it applied to every single aspect of his life things did not come easy to him mcgonagall raised her wand and conjured a feather it would probably be too difficult to use non verbal spells while you are still inexperienced therefore you may speak aloud for the time being oh okay thanks harry didntknow if he should be relieved because he could yell out the spells today or worried because he d eventually have to use his non verbal skills and he still wasnttoo sure that he even had those sorts of skills while he may have gotten away with whispering the incantations under his breath before in a classroom with dozens of other students he knew that he wouldnthave the same chance now in a one on one session with mcgonagall mcgonagall took two steps back use a summoning charm to bring this feather to you without thinking harry reached into his pocket and grabbed his wand realizing what he was doing he smiled sheepishly and pocketed it again shite it was going to be more difficult than he d thought he suddenly felt very stupid standing in the now empty great hall with his arm stretched out saying accio and watching as nothing happened he tried shouting and he tried whispering he tried it with his eyes wide open and with his eyes shut tight the feather didntmove once not even the slightest bit harry desperately wanted to grab his wand and make the bloody thing come to him already but he knew that mcgonagall would only lecture him for not taking these lessons seriously by the time mcgonagall proposed they take a break she was standing significantly closer to harry but the feather still had not budged the sun however was now clearly visible in the sky he vaguely wondered why he had even bothered accepting mcgonagall help with this it wasntas if he d ever make any improvement he wondered what ginny was doing upon checking a clock though he realized that she was probably just waking up he wished that he could just go back to the burrow and forget that he had ever done wandless magic maybe using it would help him beat voldemort like mcgonagall had said but it wouldntdo him any good if he couldntfigure out how to use it in the first place come harry said mcgonagall where re we going albus wishes to speak with you harry swallowed thickly and forced his legs to follow her he had forgotten that dumbledore portrait hung in his old office he certainly hadntrealized that he would be given the opportunity to speak with him he wondered what he should say should he apologize should he ask dumbledore why he had ever thought snape was on their side question after question entered his mind as they approached the entrance to the office he had spent so many hours in over the years mcgonagall muttered the password it was the same as it had been the night harry was there to go searching for that horcrux with dumbledore of course harry realized causing his stomach to twist uncomfortably dumbledore wasntalive after that night to change it knowing full well that any speech he prepared on his way would leave him the minute he saw dumbledore looking at his through his portrait harry followed mcgonagall into the office things are not as they seem harry what does that mean though asked harry sighing in frustration i tired of people talking in riddles what isntas it seems he was long since past being tongue tied and not knowing what to say to dumbledore he had already apologized profusely and dumbledore had already told him not to be silly dumbledore looked truly apologetic i cannot tell you why not harry demanded in your third year at hogwarts i allowed you and miss granger to use the time turner to travel back in time and save sirius black harry furrowed his brow so many rules were broken that night said dumbledore but one rule perhaps the most important one was upheld harry raised his eyebrows at his former headmaster it was absolutely necessary that you did not run into yourself while attempting to rescue your godfather and buckbeak do you know why because i would ve thought i d gone nutters dumbledore shook his head sometimes we are not meant to know things even though we think that we are until we are truly ready for them he explained sometimes we must let things play out as they would naturally how the bloody hell is any of this natural is it natural for seventeen year olds to die professor dumbledore did not reply is it no harry it is not you should tell that to ron dumbledore paused for a moment you are going to have to learn to trust others harry you cannot fix everyone problems in many cases the best way to help someone is to make them help themselves what if you re wrong asked harry what if you re wrong about this thing that you re talking about this thing you canttell me about he sighed i mean you were wrong about snape after all as soon as the words left his mouth harry knew they were probably a mistake but dumbledore merely raised his eyebrows was i he asked harry nodded grimly another thing that you must learn is to separate your emotions from your decisions you mean to say said harry slowly that you donthate snape for what he did professor snape said dumbledore and harry was amazed at his nerve snape is no longer my professor said harry just as i am no longer your professor said dumbledore but it is a courtesy that i hope you will not soon forget harry shrugged fine professor snape he said drawing out the words no i do not hate severus for what he did dumbledore answered i have not earned the right to hate him and neither have you harry harry was dumbfounded he he killed you he cried and he all but killed my parents he played the order for years he kidnapped ginny what hasnt he done i hate him sir i have the right to hate him do you i yes i do dumbledore bowed his head how is your training he asked changing the subject completely not good said harry truthfully i dontthink i ever going to get it you have only just begun dumbledore said if you remain dedicated to the program minerva has designed for you i am confident you will see results very soon harry shrugged maybe i i dontknow and have you made any progress regarding the horcruxes harry shook his head he didntwant to tell dumbledore that really horcruxes were the last thing on his mind right now behind ron being dead and hermione being in denial and training with mcgonagall and countless other things not since romania he said i see said dumbledore i am aware that many things have happened recently but i must remind you not to let the horcruxes stray too far from your mind it is imperative to yeah i know harry said but sir if i spend five days in the week training and the rest of the time looking for the remaining horcruxes he was suddenly very interested in his shoes well i mean i not going to have any time for um ginny he looked up feeling silly and dumbledore was smiling i am sure you will find a way he said of course you and miss weasley will have to make certain sacrifices i not giving up my time with ginny harry said firmly he stood from his chair suddenly restless and paced the room last term you sat here and told me that the key to destroying voldemort is love and and now after i ve finally figured out that it been staring me in the face for years you decide to tell me that the key isntjust love it a whole lot of other things too as you will soon learn why soon harry demanded why cantpeople just tell me things if they think i need to know them so bloody badly why are they trying to protect me from something that i going to have to face eventually why do they make decisions about my life that arenttheirs to make i thought you of all people would realize this you ve done it to me before you ve said so yourself harry knew that he was getting worked up and tried to take a calming breath before continuing i i just dontunderstand why everyone trusts me to save the wizarding world but they donttrust me enough to tell me the truth why does everyone think i canthandle hearing bad news i my entire life has just been one bad thing after another i d like to think i can take it by now he said bitterly i understand your frustration said dumbledore and harry wanted to ask him if he really did or if he was just saying he did because he didntsee how dumbledore how anyone could understand it seems our conversation has run longer than it should have you should be off minerva is waiting for you in the great hall i believe harry nodded and walked to the door sir he said pausing if i may ask do you have any other portraits and where are they dumbledore smiled before i died i arranged to have three portraits of myself put up one of course is here also if you take a look around grimmauld place i believe you will find me he narrowed his eyes and my third portrait he said in a voice that made harry feel as though he should know something he didn t is in spinner end oh harry said feeling quite the fool he left the office and returned to the great hall taking quick frustrated steps why did talks with dumbledore always serve to confuse him even more he thought after the night of the incident in the department of mysteries that he had earned the right to know the truth especially when the truth concerned him in such a way and he thought that his relationship with dumbledore was better than this he had spent countless evenings last term in dumbledore office learning about the horcruxes and talking about important things now however it seemed harry was right back where he started from angrier than he knew he should be harry stormed through the large doors of the great hall and found mcgonagall waiting for him are you ready to continue she asked seemingly hesitant she was still clutching the feather in her hand let go he said he reached out his hand and shouted accio his voice echoed off the walls but when it died down mcgonagall sharp intake of breath was the only sound in the room as the feather flew from her open palm and toward harry it lost momentum just before it reached his fingertips and gently floated down to the floor but the message was clear to both mcgonagall and harry harry could control his wandless abilities hermione walked into the kitchen and gasped mrs weasley she cried mrs weasley looked up from her tea what wrong dear hermione pointed at the clock you where ron name she was met with silence for a moment i i took it off mrs weasley said guiltily it too hard to look at it she took it off hermione couldntbelieve it nobody in this house spoke of ron with the exception of hermione and sometimes harry nobody went into ron room it was almost as if ron had never lived at the burrow were they trying to forget him did they think that ignoring the problem made it go away did you happen to notice what his hand was pointing at before you got rid of it she asked it was pointed at lost of course said mrs weasley hermione knew that she should tell mrs weasley ron was alive and if anyone deserved to know it was his mother but hermione didntknow how the woman would react she would either believe hermione or she wouldntunderstand and be completely outraged hermione had to go for it though there was this feeling inside of her and maybe if anyone else was going to feel that same feeling mrs weasley would she looked at ginny harry had probably told her all about their previous discussion he probably had ginny completely convinced that hermione was insane perhaps harry hadntsaid a word to ginny though perhaps hermione could tell mrs weasley and ginny how she knows ron is alive and they d believe her and ginny would convince harry really it didntmatter if everyone thought she was crazy but hermione needed harry to believe her for as long as she could remember they were always on the same side of things granted they had disagreed over what to do with the prince potion book but hadntshe been right about that but it had been okay back then now now this was much more serious than the prince she was losing her best friends ron was gone disappearing off to somewhere and not coming back for reasons unknown harry was spending most of his time with ginny and it appeared that the rest of his time would soon be spent training plus he had to spend some time searching for horcruxes there was also the aftermath of the final battle to take into consideration why did it feel like everything important in her life was moving away from her look she said sitting down i have to say something and you might be a little skeptical at first but hear me out please of course said mrs weasley ginny smiled weakly and nodded it about ron said hermione he not dead the silence was thick and heavy mrs weasley cleared her throat i sorry she said slowly what did you say he alive hermione said the clock said he was lost because because he isntdead hermione said ginny softly that enough yes said mrs weasley when a person d dies their hand on the clock will always point to lost how do you know asked hermione maybe mrs weasley sighed my mother had the same clock in her house she explained she had a hand for each of her children when my brothers gideon and fabian passed away their hands pointed to lost that doesntmean anything though that enough ginny repeated it means quite a bit said mrs weasley their hands were pointed at lost because their souls are gone forever and my r ronnie soul is g gone forever t too she sniffed and dropped her gaze to the table hermione wasntconvinced mrs weasley she said desperately dontyou understand i i can feel it my son is dead hermione she said still staring resolutely at the table let him have his peace he isnt dead it sounds crazy i know but i know it true if ron was dead i would accept it i would let him go i not a complete lunatic he isn t though and i cantpretend that he is harry said that harry knows asked ginny harry knows that you re saying these things and he didnttell anyone he doesntbelieve me either said hermione mrs weasley sniffed dramatically because you re insane said ginny my brother is dead end of story no matter how much you say otherwise you wontbring him back if you would just listen to i ve heard enough said ginny fiercely you re upsetting mum i not trying to said hermione i just enough cried ginny standing up what is wrong with you ron is dead he gone he isn t said hermione passionately looking at mrs weasley again surely she would understand she had to she would see the truth in hermione eyes but mrs weasley wouldntmeet hermione eyes i think said mrs weasley slowly that it would be best for everyone if we all just dropped this discussion she stood up excuse me she said and then left the room good going ginny spat ginny hermione pleaded you know that i not making this up maybe you dontwant to accept it but you know it true ron was your brother you must feel something can you honestly look me in the eye and tell me that he dead ginny walked over to hermione and stopped inches from her face her cheeks were bright red and her eyes were glistening with tears ron is dead she said but the rest of us aren t and how dare you bring up this rubbish around mum ginny save it said ginny brushing past her and following her mum out of the room hey joe shouted the man over the music in the club he hadntwanted to come here but joe had insisted on it he said it would be fun so far though the man wasnthaving any fun bellatrix lestrange who is she joe looked up from his drink what who told you about her the man shrugged nobody i read about her in the paper you gave me this morning oh said joe so asked the man who is she dontworry about it he said dismissively you know who you should be thinking about that girl over there she watching you the man looked up and saw that a girl in the corner one with long straight blonde hair and a very pretty smile was indeed watching him joe nudged him go for it feeling slightly self conscious perhaps she wasntlooking at him the man grinned and went over to her hello there he said can i buy you a drink she smiled i ve already got one she said but you can certainly buy yourself one and join me if you d like oh he d definitely like that he sat down at the bar beside her and ordered a firewhisky several drinks later the girl rachel grabbed his arm and pulled him to his feet let dance she said seductively pulling him to the centre of the dance floor he didntwant to dance really though what they were doing couldntbe called dancing she was rubbing her gorgeous body against his in an altogether delicious way and his head was swimming from the firewhisky rachel pulled his face down to hers and kissed him he could taste the alcohol on her and didntlike it she moaned in his mouth and when she wrapped her arms around his neck he resisted the urge to push her away something about her was wrong but that was ridiculous she was funny sexy and brilliant at snogging still something about her was wrong i love you he whispers he mentally screams then calling himself an idiot for ever telling her that hermione doesntlove him and he gone and scared her now hasnthe she not going to be able to look at him when he gets back he feels her let go of his arm and when he pulls his mouth away from her ear she is staring at him in absolute shock what she sounds scared for a moment he isntsure if she scared of him going off or of his feelings for her perhaps she is afraid of her feelings for him but he sees it in her eyes and he knows she loves him she always has and he wants to kiss her again he wants to brush that beautiful brown hair out of her even more beautiful face and wipe away her tears but he can t he is needed elsewhere isnthe he feels a sense of panic and thrill when kingsley begins counting to three he has to go he wants to go but he doesntwant to leave we ll talk when i get back he says her face falls as if she momentarily forgot that he is leaving and he hates himself for having to choose between his sister and the love of his life he wonders if he is making the right choice hell he isnteven making the choice there is no choice there is no contest no debate no question about it but he still has to go after ginny in spite of it she needs him more now at least he thinks she does there is a tugging at his navel and the last clear image he sees before he is gone is of her because really she is all he ever been able to see clearly the man pushed her away gently and gasped what wrong she asked he couldnteven begin to tell her everything that was wrong he was having flashes of people he didntknow places he had never been he could see them clear as day but as soon as the flash was done he would not be able to pick them out of a lineup he knew there was a girl but who was she what was she to him i i think it time i leave he told her over the music you know go home want some company he shook his head he didntthink that was such a good idea and not just because he was rooming with joe and didntthink it would be appropriate to bring some girl back no matter how much joe seemed to have encouraged it no thanks i uh i ll see you around he said and then the man left not bothering to grace joe with an explanation when joe caught his eye and threw up his hands in confusion the man was far more confused that joe anyway dumbledore fascinates me but unfortunately i dontwrite him nearly as well as jkr to that note dontflame me for disgracing his character i ve read worse as always reviews are greatly appreciated disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty six unsettled much to his surprise harry was actually making progress with his training in the weeks that followed his first training session he was finding that summoning charms at least were coming more easily to him as he and professor mcgonagall soon discovered his wandless magic was at its best when harry was feeling a particularly strong emotion to be sure of this mcgonagall thought it best to conduct an experiment harry didntsee the point it was quite obvious that this was the case through and through still he was forced to comply with her wishes she asked him to close his eyes and fill his mind with memories of professor sprout thinking this was extremely unusual he did so and when asked to summon one by one half a dozen heavy books taken from the restricted section of the library all lined up in a row on the table he was barely able to move the first two toward him before his magic died out he was then asked to think of hagrid and his mind immediately conjured up the image of him pointing his pink umbrella at dudley and giving his cousin a pig tail he was able to summon five of the six books this time and then when asked to think of professor snape all six books flew at him with such force that the last and heaviest one nearly knocked him over finally deciding that harry had practiced summoning charms enough for now professor mcgonagall informed him that they would be moving on and trying other spells when she said this harry mind went to human transfigurations one of the last units they had done in sixth year he wondered how in the world he would be able to do this but forced himself to believe that he would be able to after all once he got the hang of it it wouldntbe too hard to change his eyebrows to different colours right mcgonagall of course was thinking something a little bit different you want me to do what harry asked the words spilled out of his mouth before he could stop them take this match and turn it into a needle mcgonagall said honestly what were you expecting we would start with human transfigurations she asked with an amused tone i no of course not said harry lamely but this was our very first lesson at hogwarts ever i am pleased that you remember your first transfiguration lesson she said briskly but yes just as you had to begin at the bottom then you must do so now however unnecessary it may seem to you harry sighed but nodded as he soon learned though this turning a match into a needle business was harder than he d remembered it being somehow miraculously he got through it and he got through the handful of other spells he was instructed to do mcgonagall was so pleased with his improvements that she worked with him tirelessly through the day and sometimes well past dinner and into the night so not to lose any momentum though he never told her he attributed any and all progress to the fact that he could close his eyes and replay certain things awful things he could see snape kill dumbledore see hermione lying perfectly still on the grass after ginny had been taken see ginny in that dungeon see ron disappearing in malfoy manor and use it as his motivation as to be expected replaying the most disturbing moments in his life was rather draining and unfortunately he was spending more time at hogwarts doing just that than anything else mcgonagall had informed him last week that he was to begin other aspects of his training each morning harry would work on his wandless magic with mcgonagall after midday however his schedule varied mondays were occlumency lessons with kingsley shacklebolt who it turned out was rather skilled at occlumency and legilimency tuesdays and wednesdays included practicing armed combat and physical training with tonks on thursdays and fridays he had newt level defense against the dark arts lessons with lupin harry wanted to ask when no if this workload would ever lighten but he held his tongue mcgonagall would probably find some way to take offence to his words and give him a nice long lecture about how he should be grateful that everyone was willing to help him and although he was grateful there was the small voice in the back of his mind whispering that he shouldntbe wasting his time on this he was rather disheartened to realize that this voice was hermione s and that it was whispering to quit training so much because he needed to find ron ginny ginny looked up to see hermione standing in the doorway of her bedroom yes i um i think i left one of my books in here hermione said ginny stared at her wondering what she was supposed to do about that would it be okay if i looked around for it do whatever you want ginny said knowing she was being miserable and rude really though why couldnt she be rude to hermione wasnthermione the one who came up to ginny and mrs weasley and starting saying crazy untrue things that only made ron death hurt so much more and wasnthermione the reason for the awkwardness between them ginny had every right to yell at hermione that day ron was her brother he was dead and it might have even been because of ginny foolishness just because hermione and ron had been whatever they had been that didntgive hermione the right to blatantly lie and refuse to accept the fact that ron was dead and hermione pretended that she really believed it what rubbish hermione was the smartest most logical person that ginny d ever met there was no way she really believed that ron was walking around somewhere perfectly alive and well and how dare she say those things to ginny mum mrs weasley was a mess maybe harry and hermione didntrealize the severity of her mum grief but ginny did her brothers did too they had all grown up with her they grew up with her tough love tactics and the fact that their mum hadntraised her voice since ron death weeks ago was cause for concern the house wasntas tidy as it used to be nobody had been ordered into the backyard to de gnome the garden since the wedding although it seemed stupid the real clincher was that mrs weasley cooking was a little off telling someone in that sort of state that their son wasnt dead when he clearly was just didntfly for ginny she watched as hermione came into her bedroom and looked around awkwardly ginny considered telling hermione that her book was on the desk but then hermione spotted it for herself she smiled and as she crossed the room to the small desk ginny wondered if hermione actually tried to be a complete bookworm or if it just came naturally either way even though ginny was still angry she loved hermione for it but when hermione did not make to pick up her book and simply stood there instead ginny craned her neck to see what the girl was doing she was holding something else in her hand oh the picture she realized she d forgotten about it colin had taken it just before everything went from bad to worse it was of ginny harry hermione and ron they were at hogwarts in the picture down by the lake in fact she remembered colin walking by and saying that they looked so happy the four of them and then he d insisted on taking their picture they had all smiled and waved at the camera except for ron who d made stupid faces as always hermione had elbowed him in the ribs and told him that his immaturity was ruining the picture so he d mussed up her hair and when she went to yell at him he d told her that her disgruntled appearance wasntmaking the picture any nicer than his faces were hermione turned so ginny could see her face she was smiling it was a sad wistful sort of smile and it made ginny mouth feel too dry she really thinks that ron is alive hermione looked up at ginny then and ginny couldntget past the thought that hermione was perhaps the saddest person she d ever known i remember taking this said hermione it turned out nice ginny smiled because nice was exactly the opposite of what hermione had said the picture would be when they were posing for it really though the picture was perfect it captured all of their personalities perfectly ron was being silly and he and hermione were bickering just as they always did harry had his arm slung around ginny shoulder in a protective yet casual way one that made ginny smile yeah said ginny yeah it did hermione set the picture back down and picked up her book thanks she said and then turned to leave ginny knew that she had to say something now but what could she say wait she called hermione stopped and turned back around i shite she was no good at this i sorry there she said it hermione just looked at her you you re sorry she asked ginny forced herself to nod yeah i mean i am i sorry that i snapped at you before she sighed and shifted suddenly uncomfortable under hermione gaze but you ve got to understand how insane you seemed how insane you still seem you you cantjust come downstairs and start saying stuff like that especially to mum hermione looked down i didntmean to upset her i know said ginny but you did i feel really bad about that hermione said sincerely looking back up ginny nodded and i feel really bad about yelling at you i i dontknow what came over me but ginny did know and every time she thought back to the conversation in the kitchen she felt her angry building up again it fine said hermione i ll try to think before i say things like that from now on i promise ginny smiled okay okay said hermione come on dinner should be ready by now yeah i ll be right there said ginny hermione smiled and left it felt good to have cleared the air with hermione with harry at training everyday hermione really was her only source of human contact other than her family and even theywerentalways available to chat still though ginny couldnthelp but dwell on the fact that hermione hadntdirectly apologized for saying such crazy things about ron or even bothered to explain why she had said them i almost forgot a letter came for you ginny ginny looked up from her dinner what she asked a letter came for you just before you came down said mrs weasley here ginny reached her hand out and accepted the letter feeling her heart drop upon reading the front ginny it said in what was undoubtedly dean messy scrawl a part of her had been expecting this letter for several days upon hearing the news of ron death dean and many others had sent letters of condolences he had said nice things like ron was one of the best blokes i ve ever met and i here for you her family hadntresponded to most of the letters there had been an overwhelming amount really but ginny felt she should reply to dean letter she was polite saying things like thank you that means a lot and hope you re doing well she knew back when she had sent the reply that she was sort of letting dean back into her life but what could she do she couldnt not write him back after they had broken up at hogwarts they hadntspoken well he hadntspoken to her and since she had been the one to end things she sort of had to respect his wishes and in turn not speak to him she opened the letter and read it through once then twice unable to keep the frown off her face when she read give my best to hermione and harry the word harry was in darker ink as if dean had pressed his quill harder into the parchment while writing it she did not like the way he said that he missed her nor did she like the way he signed his letter love dean it wasntas if dean really loved her though or did he they had dated for nearly a year after all they d never said the words of course and although she had liked dean quite a bit she certainly hadnt loved him oh merlin what if dean still had feelings for her she told herself she was being silly if the situations had been reversed ginny would have sent dean a letter of condolences and she might have even signed it love ginny she was overreacting and even if she wasn t it didntreally matter are you okay asked hermione ginny shrugged it from dean she said hermione just looked at her so so said ginny he writing me we re writing each other apparently she corrected herself her finger pointing to the spot on the page where dean wrote hope to hear from you again soon would it be so horrible to keep in contact with him inquired hermione it not as if we ll be seeing our old friends at hogwarts this year it would be good for us all to keep in touch if you ask me ginny sighed i know i write luna and neville a lot she said but dean is different i i dontwant him to become some sort of viktor krum hermione smiled harry is not going to get jealous if you get a letter or two from dean you never know he isntlike that said hermione reasonably he different when it just the two of us said ginny i mean he mrs weasley cleared her throat ginny felt her cheeks flush and she looked down at the letter again her mum was still a bit upset with ginny and harry on the first morning of harry training she had gone to wake him up and found him in ginny bed while harry had been off training that day ginny and her mum had the talk something that they d had once before when ginny was fourteen but this more recent one had been far more detailed and ginny had promised her mum that she and harry would sleep in separate rooms from then on hermione was still staying in ron old bedroom so harry was set up in bill old room mrs weasley hadntknown not until two mornings ago when she had found harry in ginny bed yet again that harry waited until everyone was asleep before apparating down to ginny room each night ginny promised her mum that it would not happen again of course she was referring to the fact that they would not be caught again but her mum didntknow that and ginny didntfeel the need to bring it to her attention she didntcare it wasntas if she could sleep without harry anyway it was almost as if he had the ability to chase away her nightmares and that was a good thing because ginny hadnthad nightmares since the summer after her first year at hogwarts and the feelings of helplessness that accompanied them were not something she cared to repeat night after night harry ginny looked up you re home mrs weasley said i yeah said harry tonks let me come home early she said hmm well she said something and here i am he sighed and dropped down in the seat next to ginny she smiled in greeting but frowned when she really looked at him are you all right she asked huh he asked oh yeah i good she and hermione exchanged worried looks harry said hermione you dontlook good thanks harry said lightly leaning back in his chair and closing his eyes mrs weasley rushed over to him and put her hand on his forehead why dontyou go upstairs and rest you re exhausted harry shook his head no i not he said you re falling asleep in your chair said ginny i just resting my eyes said harry that it said mrs weasley i going to have a word with minerva first thing in the morning this is ridiculous no said harry it please mrs weasley i appreciate it but i fine i just a little tired tonks had me running laps around the quidditch pitch how many he shrugged i lost count hermione made a noise between a horrified gasp and an outraged cry they cantdo this she cried why are they doing this to see how much you can take before you crack before she could go off into a rant though harry sat up straight and reached out his hand ginny watched awestruck as the letter grasped tightly in her hand flew to harry and he caught it that why they re doing this harry said so i can learn how to control all these things that i can do and i damn lucky that they re even bothering to invest their time in me he looked down at the letter what this mrs weasley began clearing the dishes and hermione stood up to help ginny did not miss the look that passed between the two of them nor did she miss the way hermione began washing the dishes the muggle way making an effort to make quite a bit of noise in the process mrs weasley had been right harry was exhausted but what was he supposed to do tell tonks thank you but no i dontthink i too keen on training today he couldntdo that he wouldnt do that he was annoyed by the way nobody at the burrow seemed to understand that he had to train or else he probably wouldnteven survive to the final showdown with voldemort and he was also annoyed by the way ginny was avoiding his question what what asked ginny this harry said holding up the letter in his hand oh she said that yeah said harry what is it it a letter she said obviously who it from through he asked hoping she would say luna or neville or another one of their friends he had been meaning to write them for weeks but hadntgotten around to it he knew that ginny kept up correspondence with many of their friends and if he actually thought about it he was rather curious as to how they were doing sometimes he forgot that there was a world outside of the burrow headquarters and the great hall of hogwarts luna no said ginny this one from um dean actually oh harry said but his voice sounded a little too controlled even to his ears he didntwant dean writing to ginny it wasntthat he didnttrust ginny hell it wasnteven that he thought dean would try to make a move on her but for some reason a part of him just wasntcomfortable with the idea a bloke had noright sending letters to an ex girlfriend if she was in another relationship that was reasonable he wasntbeing overbearing or jealous right he wanted to tell us that he was sorry about ron said ginny giving him a measured glance and he told me to say hello to you harry didntquite believe this but really did it matter what dean had put in his letter harry was the one ginny loved not dean he told himself not to say anything stupid he didntwant to fight with ginny not about something stupid like letters from dean and he certainly didntwant to sound as foolish as ron had whenever hermione spoke about her letters from viktor krum make sure you tell him i say hello back harry said pretending he gave a rat arse about anything they were currently discussing okay said ginny and harry knew that she wasntreally going to include it in her next letter but he didntreally care she smiled at him he being very nice she said and i dontreally want to write him but i cantbe rude and not reply to his letters harry felt like a git then because dean wasntwriting poetry and romantic verses to ginny professing his undying love for her he was writing to say he was sorry that ron was dead and even if he did have ulterior motives so what it wasntas if ginny was going to ditch him and run off with dean and if in some strange alternate universe it did happen well harry wasntpracticing physical and armed combat for nothing yeah harry said i know he yawned it was barely dark out but he was too tired to keep his eyes open any longer i going up to bed he kissed her goodnight and went up to bed where he had a fitful sleep dreaming of quidditch and dean and a strange man with black hair who lived across the ocean all the while hermione voice echoing in his head saying look closer the man was sleeping it was a nice deep sleep most importantly it was absolutely dreamless thank merlin for that all week he had been having nightmares well they werentreally nightmares he wished they could be nightmares but they werentfrightening they didntcause him to wake up in a cold sweat or reach out for someone to calm his nerves no if anything these dreams were pleasant that was the most unsettling thing each night he awoke to a foggy mind but a clear mental picture of a pretty girl with brown hair and chocolate eyes who was this girl she i hermione granger by the way who are you she says looking down at him with a snooty smile he feels like an idiot because he hadntmeant for her to see him attempt to turn his rat yellow he shouldnthave trusted george he should have known that spell wouldntwork he just made an arse of himself in front of harry potter and this stupid obnoxious annoying girl of course she isntstupid if she can learn all those books off by heart and get spells to work for her she just might be brilliant she sure seems like the bookworm type at any rate this is just the sort of thing that would happen to him too it is just his luck that on his first day of hogwarts he ends up seated between the boy who lived and this girl hermione who is looking at him as though she thinks he is a freak and well she wouldntbe completely incorrect with that assumption would she what next will he be sorted into slytherin or something dreadful like that as if this day isntkicking his arse already maybe things will be okay though once hermione gets out of their compartment he and harry can go back to eating their every flavour beans and talking about stupid unimportant things he wants her to leave but she does not seem to be going anywhere and it confuses him it doesntbother him but it does confuse him hermione granger is going to throw him for a loop he can tell what kind of a name is hermione anyway it not like anything he has ever heard before it awfully strange even his sister ginevra has a better name than that he hates the look that crosses her face when harry introduces himself he wonders if it is the same look that was on his just moments ago when he first stumbled into the compartment and sat down he hadntexpected harry potter to be so completely unaware of himself or of the magical world the one he saved years and years ago before he could walk or talk or read or write or even do much of anything honestly when his older brothers had speculated on the way to king cross that harry potter would probably be on the train he hadntcared all that much he was expecting harry to be self involved and cocky probably a master at all sorts of spells ones his brother percy in fifth year hadnteven learned yet instead harry is nice and funny and just a bit awkward what with the fact that he says you know who name as easily as he says his own neither of which really should be uttered with such a loose tongue as the girl goes on and on about all the books harry is in he wonders how one person could possibly retain such information the facts just roll off her tongue with ease and he wonders if she spent her entire summer holed up inside her bedroom studying things that they wouldntneed to know for ages he feels a bit inadequate because he hasnteven bothered opening his schoolbooks yet judging by the look on harry face though he isntthe only one who will be unprepared this girl is bossy and self assured and she holds her chin just a little too high for his liking and when she tells them to get into their robes because they ll be at hogwarts shortly he is reminded of percy finally she leaves and although it is what he wanted there is a voice in the back of his mind whispering that he should have moved over a bit that he should have made room for her to sit down with him and harry whatever house i in i hope she not in it he says and maybe it the truth or maybe it a dirty lie the man whimpered but did not wake in the morning he would do as he always did examine his dreams hoping to rouse his subconscious until he finally conceded to the fact that he could remember nothing and no one this was terrible and frustrating and made him want to scream in his dreams he knew who she was he knew who he was but then he would wake up and all he had to remind him of his dream were the uncomfortable feelings in the pit of his stomach and the beads of sweat dripping down his forehead he hated this he hated how he was so bloody torn he wanted these dreams to end he wanted them to keep going he wanted to get to the bottom of them he wanted to forget all about them on the plus side though he d stopped having flashes during the day he had finally broken down and told joe about them and his friend gave him a small potion saying it would help put a lid on whatever was bothering him he had taken the potion hesitantly at first unsure of whether or not it would work unsure of whether or not he wanted it to work sweet relief came eventually when he realized that he was no longer bombarded with images of people he had never met he now took the potion every morning and hermione is twelve lying in the hospital wing he hates himself for not being able to wake her up he hates himself because everything seems to be turning to shite lately and he can do nothing to stop it he hates himself because it should have been him not her he does not want to think about the very real fact that he could lose her sure she may wake up from her current state but she is still a muggle and it is still dangerous for her to be around while this whole chamber of secrets business is going on she probably wontspeak to him for days after she wakes up anyway she ll know just as he knows that he should have protected her better that it is his fault she is petrified he wontblame her for hating him and even if she doesnthate him forever although he isntgetting his hopes up he might not see her again unless this situation is resolved hogwarts will have to close harry will come to the burrow for the summer but what will she do she ll go back to her house and probably forget all about him an owl might come with word from her every few weeks but it will probably be letters for harry sometimes he thinks that hermione likes harry more than him she must she doesntargue with harry harry never gets on her nerves harry hadntlaughed at her tail other times though he thinks that she enjoys their arguing just as much as he does sure hermione can drive him up the wall but it wouldntfeel the same if she didntnag him to do his homework or yell at him for having his uniform shirt untucked he has done his homework every single night since hermione was hurt and he tried really hard not to curse or talk with his mouth full or be late for class and when that doesnthelp he goes to visit her in the hospital wing he wants to yell at her to scream that she has to get up because he and harry need her too much but instead he sits there with harry and stares at her trying to figure out why this had to happen and what he can do about it it up to him after all harry has other things on his mind he accused of being the heir of slytherin but how can he be the heir he in gryffindor harry is his best mate and if harry swears that he didntknow he could speak parseltongue that he really isntinvolved in this at all then that is the truth besides harry would never hurt hermione like that why cantthe other kids realize that justin finch fletchley the great sod this is his fault if he hadntaccused harry of setting that snake on him and then on top of all this there his sister ginny has been acting a little weird lately well not really she was acting this way during the summer sort of and she always been a little strange really maybe she just acting odd because of harry she got a huge crush on harry after all he feels bad for ginny because he knows that harry will never see her as anything more than the youngest weasley his best mate baby sister but maybe it for the best because harry tends to attract trouble wherever he goes and ginny doesntneed to be mixed up in that sort of thing everything is such a mess he wonders how much longer this will continue for he doesntthink he ll be able to take it if things dontget better soon but things will they have to harry will figure something out he always does right alas my exams are over french religion science math history and english six exams in five days makes my head spin okay this means i can dedicate myself to writing this again i cantexpress how frustrated i was knowing that i hadntupdated in weeks but not being able to sit down and write this story has been all over the place lately and the updates have been few and far between and i terribly sorry but i want to thank everyone who hasntgiven up on me i haventforgotten about this and i have every intention of finishing it i ve just been too busy studying to do much about anything concerning this story there still a ton in store for you all to that end check out my profile page because i ve got a ton of h g one shots up that i d love for you all to read disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter twenty seven the truth one harry says as they walk what there only going to be one peg harry says dontyou see voldemort isntan idiot he knows that the more people there are at the end the better the chance that they ll get the horcrux he feels like an idiot because he hadnt thought of that it makes perfect sense of course but does that mean harry has to go on by himself in this death trap oh merlin he doesntreally know what to say to harry then good luck doesntseem appropriate dontdie doesntfeel right either d you think hermione okay he asks of course she is harry says and doesntsound sure i mean she was okay enough to argue with us about going back wasntshe yeah he says yeah she was still he doesntfinish his sentence because he feels harry hand on him telling him to stop this is it harry says sure enough a single plank appears taunting them with everything it symbolizes he curses and looks at harry and even though he knows that this has to happen that it has to be harry who goes on not just because he is the chosen one but also because he has a better chance of actually getting the horcrux and making it back alive ron doesntwant him to he d much rather go along because as much as he hates the idea that they have to go through this trouble of finding these horcruxes he hates the idea that harry ultimately has to do it alone even more it just not fair that one person should be burdened with so much wish me luck i guess harry says and then makes to move forward he cantstop himself before he even realizes what he is doing he is reaching out and hugging harry something that he cantremember ever doing before harry hesitates for a moment before awkwardly putting an arm around him and they embrace like brothers because that what they are what they have always been and it feels as if he is seeing everything for the first time here in this dark smelly old tunnel harry has always been just harry in his eyes but there is no such thing as just harry this boy the one he split a bag of every flavoured beans with on their first train ride to hogwarts and who was captain of the quidditch team and who dated his baby sister this boy is going to save the world he knows this of course he has always known this but he hadnt realized it until just now this is sort of like the first time he looked up and saw hermione as something other than his sometimes annoying too smart for her own good best friend he lets go of harry feeling like an even bigger idiot now because he probably just given harry the impression that he doesntthink harry will make it back and maybe he won t good luck he says and then watches as harry crosses the plank the man who spent his days wearing someone else face crept out of his room clutching his wand tightly and went outside he looked around making sure his houseguest hadntstirred and followed him outside to see what was going on upon seeing that he had managed to slip away undetected he disapparated with a crack i ve been waiting said a voice a man stepped out of the shadows i know lucius but i had to be sure that weasley was asleep before i left wouldntwant him to get suspicious would we he sighed and looked around is it safe of course it is said lucius now give me your progress report this is ridiculous he declares yeah well we can always take matters into our own hands fred says in a low voice what d you mean he asks his brothers exchange glances and george beams we can take the muggle car we can fly to harry and rescue him ourselves you think harry can be here by morning says fred harry coming keep your voice down ginny fred hisses you said harry was going to be here in the morning she squeals he not coming here at all because you re obsessed with him and he hates you george tells her ginny mouth falls open in shock and then before the tears come fred says go to bed his sister is gone now and fred and george are looking at him with identical glints of mischief in their eyes we re going to be in a load of trouble when we get back he says as if this is a reason not to go but it harry and harry would do the same thing for him yeah fred says with a smile let go says george it isntworking you say no lucius i dontthink it is well that just wontdo said lucius i know but i ve tried everything there nothing we can do to keep him from remembering lucius smirked there is one thing he said yes but i thought that was our last resort the dark lord said i am aware of what the dark lord said however if weasley is getting his memories back as rapidly as you say he is i see no other option how can we use his strength to our advantage if he starts to regain his identity halfway through our training program we must do it fine i ll do it as soon as i get back to the house weasley staying with me i mean joe after all it the perfect opportunity excellent said lucius you should go now the sooner we get rid of this problem the better am i right amycus amycus carrow grinned and took a swig of the potion he carried with him he braced himself for the feeling he had become somewhat used to over the passing weeks he no longer cringed at the potion taste and he no longer doubled over as the first wave of burning hit him when the transformation was complete his nose had shrunk and his eyes had become slightly more spaced apart changing to a light green his hair had grown longer thicker and curlier than before turning a very light shade of blonde his jaw had squared slightly his cheeks now appeared less hollow his eyes less sunken in he cleared his throat you re very right said amycus his accent was nearly gone now and his voice was different not as deep and certainly not as aggressive i must be off lucius nodded curtly with that joe disapparated away from the place amycus carrow had apparated to mere moments before we won he yells as harry enters the common room four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty we won he waves the cup around feeling proud because he actually contributed to this victory because this is one thing that harry hasntheld his hand through but harry isntlooking at him it not really clear who he looking at really it looks like it might be no harry isntallowed to look at ginny with that expression the next few seconds happen in slow motion it feels he isntsure what is going on harry is kissing his sister right out in the open for all of gryffindor to see he is so bloody confused who would want to kiss ginny well other than dean and michael and okay so maybe he noticed that his baby sister has attracted some attention but since when is harry interested in her and why hasntharry ever said anything before they re supposed to be best mates he looks around the room and sees that everyone is watching them dean looks about ready to wring harry neck and hermione is grinning from ear to ear as if she has been expecting this all along why does nobody ever bother to clue him in on these things lavender is looking wistful as if she misses snogging him like that she looks up and catches his eye so he looks back at harry and ginny to avoid having to get into a discussion with her he doesntwant to get back together with her he doesnteven know why he bothered with her in the first place harry finally pulls away from ginny and looks up he doesntknow what he will do when their eyes meet he isntupset he sort of relieved in a way harry is decent well dean is decent too but harry would be better for ginny because because he harry it isnta good logic but it makes sense to him so when harry catches his eye he half nods his approval when they leave he doesntthink he wants to know where they re going and what they re going to do when they get there he sits with hermione and listens to her babble on and on about how she caught harry staring at ginny twice this week and that she just knew this would happen eventually hermione he says and she stops her rant to look up quit talking about harry and tell me about how spectacular my saves were he is only half kidding and hermione must know that just like she knows everything else there ever is to know about him because she smiles warmly and says you were spectacular ron ron awoke and sat up in his bed then abruptly fell onto his back again as images of another life hit him like a wall an awkward looking house just outside of ottery st catchpole a small girl with red hair crying because her brothers teased her flying in a car with twin redheads a castle with trick stairs and ghosts and talking portraits a boy with messy hair and glasses one who had more courage than godric gryffindor himself and who spent almost as much time in the hospital wing as madam promfrey and a girl a girl who smiled at him almost as much as she shouted who lectured him until he thought he d go mad a girl who never got anything less than outstanding on every essay she ever turned in a girl he loved more than anything else in the entire bloody world he heard a creak and his eyes flew to his door just in time to see the knob turn joe ron rasped forcing himself to sit up thank merlin you re here i what re you doing joe smiled eerily and lowered his wand i thought i heard you cry out i came to see if everything was okay is everything okay ron wanted to tell him he wanted to tell him everything about the dreams about hermione and harry and ginny but he was hesitant he didntknow if he could trust joe and it was terrible really because joe hadntever been anything but overly friendly to him he d showed ron around town and helped him come up with a background story for when people asked where he d come from hell he d let ron live with him still he couldntdeny the fact that something about joe didntsit well with him had never really sat well with him ron huh ron asked snapping out of his thoughts sorry what i asked if you were okay honestly you re acting all spotty what going on ron shrugged nothing he said deciding that it would be easier if he didnttell joe anything if he told his story he would have to spend quite a bit of time explaining everything he wouldntbe able to make a move until morning maybe even later than that if he didn t he could leave a note saying goodbye and slip away he would get back home faster that way you re sure yeah he said they stared at each other for several long moments until joe nodded said goodnight and left and although joe had said he was going to bed ron didnthear the sound of retreating footsteps down the hall he grabbed his wand off the nightstand and climbed out of bed and before he d even realized what he was doing he was arranging his pillows to make it look as though he was still under the covers and then creeping across the room and standing in the corner hidden by the shadows he wasntsure what he expected but when joe opened his door and crept back in a little more than half an hour later a part of him wasntsurprised he held his breath and watched as joe pointed his wand in the direction of his bed and whispered avada expelliarmus he cried joe wand flew onto the bed and joe spun around his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open in shock did that really just happen it must have the only other option was that ron was going crazy and he didntlike that idea one bit joe had tried to kill him why joe dove to the bed and grabbed his wand before ron could react who who are you asked ron joe said nothing you called me ron how did you know cantyou guess questioned joe i the reason you re here ron head was spinning you your name isntjoe is it you ve finally figured it out have you who are you ron demanded does it matter yes ron growled gripping his wand this was the man who d taken him away from his family all this time he d pretended to be ron friend i want to know who i about to murder the other man laughed you think you ll murder me i could kill you without even batting an eye probably said ron thinking logically for possibly the first time in his life but you ve had more than a few opportunities before now you must have been keeping me around for something i was yes but you are no longer needed but i was needed before he urged i want to know why and i want to know what changed the war is over said the other man the dark lord has emerged victorious you are of no use to him anymore the dark lord it made sense of course who else but you know who would go throw all the trouble of sending ron halfway across the world when he could ve just killed him and been done with it but you know who hadntwon he couldnthave won this man was lying he was messing with ron head and it was working he won huh ron said stalling as he tried to come up with a plan a way out i dontbelieve that for a minute it doesntmatter what you believe you ll be dead soon anyway the dark lord has given the order and i will follow through with it what he not going to do it himself ron asked feeling the panic rising inside of him oh i suppose he too busy off somewhere killing all the muggles and good honest wizards tell me though once he killed everyone who isntgood enough do you think he ll be satisfied no he ll start picking off his followers then i will die with honour because i have served my lord i dontthink you ll be so honourable when you re staring down the end of voldemort wand ron taunted do not say his name why not he only a person after all nothing special about him whatsoever ron said realizing for the first time why harry and hermione and ginny always said his name did you know that he a half blood his father was a muggle makes him a right foul hypocrite wouldntyou say shut your mouth why what re you going to do asked ron take me away from my friends and family hold me hostage try to kill me you ve done you re worst already and you ve failed come here what will voldemort think when he finds out that his servant was bested by a weasley i bet that ll really stick in his side you re lucky you wontbe around to witness it firsthand come here why because we are going to duel said the other man the death eater i assume you understand what that entails i certainly hope you are better than your pathetic father was at any rate ron tensed what did you say what about my dad the death eater laughed sharply oh dontworry your father is with your dear old mum now my mum ron repeated and he could hear the fear in his own voice what happened to my parents what did you do to them he was met with a sneer tell me ron demanded tell me right now i would like to tell you that they went peacefully but well i wouldntwant to lie to you their deaths were rather messy ron was choking on his own panic his parents this was a lie they couldntbe dead your mother didnteven have to die the death eater continued she was trying to save that brat the other bitch with red hair ginny is not a bitch ah yes ginny he said that was her name i vaguely recall potter screaming it but does it matter she not really anything now he gloated i was aiming for the mudblood see but i hit the littlest weasel instead dontworry though severus took care of the mudblood got the wolf too he did ron knees suddenly felt weak oh no oh merlin this wasnthappening this was a bad dream this was no he was going to wake up and it was going to be the morning of bill wedding and he would have time to save everyone you re a liar he said because it couldntbe true his parents and ginny couldntbe dead hermione couldntbe dead dontcall me a liar then dont lie shall we settle this with a duel the death eater challenged unless you dontthink you can keep up is that how voldemort does it then makes his death eaters do all of his bidding asked ron well i wouldntexpect anything else from him the dark lord is the greatest wizard in the world and harry potter is the greatest wizard in the world harry potter was a silly boy who thought he could beat the dark lord at his own game the death eater said calmly pointing his wand square at ron face he failed miserably of course nobody goes up against the dark lord and lives to tell about it for long harry couldnthave failed ron said i would know it would be all over the papers it only just happened he said unfazed i expect the ministry in london doesnteven know it yet oh i would love to be there when they discover that their beloved harry potter is dead harry potter isntdead oh but he is i had the pleasure of witnessing it myself he took an awful long time to go but he is dead nonetheless now he said brightly we duel ron didntknow what to believe the only thing he knew was that he definitely wasntgetting out alive unless he fought if hermione and harry and his family were gone though did he really want to live then again this man could be lying to him and as long as there was the hope that his loved ones were all still alive and well ron would fight fine he said but we re skipping the pleasantries oh but i do so enjoy those the man said dryly taran protego ron said instantly a avada crucio ron was not aware that he collapsed on the floor he was not aware that he was screaming at the top of his lungs all he knew was that this pain was a million times worse than anything he had ever imagined or experienced before harry wasntkidding when he said it would make someone pray for death had ginny felt this oh he hoped not the curse was lifted thankfully almost as quickly as he was subjected to it you know weasley said the man i had always pegged you as someone who followed the rules of fair play let me make something clear you do not attempt unforgivables and i will not perform unforgivables not until i ve have my fun at least do we understand each other ron grunted and got up off the floor no deal give me your worst he took off into a run he was being chased by an angry death eater who wanted nothing more than to throw the killing curse at him and be done with it the scariest thing by far had to be the fact that ron was nearly positive he could kill almost as easily as the man in the next room stupefy protego ron yelled spinning around just in time to see the death eater come into the room after him reducto the death eater ducked and the curse soared past him knocking out a large portion of the wall ron lived with ginny and his mum long enough to know when to run and so he ran out of the room and hid around the corner throwing a trip jinx at the death eater as he rushed by enough playing around he snarled he threw out a curse that ron had never heard before ron jumped out of the way and watched as the couch behind him was sliced in half expelliarmus the death eater wand flew out of his hand and they both lunged for it but the death eater was quicker and he grabbed the wand before ron could reach it incendio the curtains behind ron caught on fire and ron had half a mind to put them out but then there was another spell fired at him and all he could think to do was protect himself he couldntseem to think of a spell though and briefly wondered why he had to pick now of all moments to forget everything he d learned in the da he did the only thing that seemed logical he threw out his fist and let it connect with the other man face soon they were both punching and kicking rolling around on the floor ron couldntfigure out why anyone would ever duel with wands because it was so much more satisfying to simply beat your fists against your enemy after the other man got in a few good shots ron was starting to think that maybe wands were safer after all he got up too focused on getting away to notice how he wobbled on his feet and clutched his wand tightly in school whenever malfoy had challenged him ron hated backing down in any situation really he hated giving in accepting defeat but now against someone who was far more experienced and who wouldnthesitate to cause him unimaginable pain all he could do was wait for a chance to hightail it out of there and he had always secretly yearned for a chance to prove himself for something he could do without harry but this was not the time to have pride and even someone as stubborn as him could see that he cast a bat bogey hex hoping for the chance to run away while his opponent was distracted but ginny had always been the expert on that not him the jinx was weak and barely anything happened furnunculus impedimenta protego crucio ron didntremember running down the corridor and into the kitchen but he was glad he did he dove behind the table and it was blown apart by the curse he jumped up from behind the remains of a chair and saw that his opponent hair had become a different colour the polyjuice potion he took must have been wearing off the man doubled over and ron saw his opportunity locomotor mortis the death eater never saw it coming his legs locked and he collapsed his mouth an o of shock he started to shout something probably the killing curse but ron for once was faster stupefy the death eater eyes fluttered shut and ron finally felt his knees go weak he dropped to the floor and pulled himself over to the death eater grabbing his wand he snapped it in half the only thing he could think of that would protect him if for some reason his enemy was to wake before ron was ready incarcerous ron choked out he waited a moment and made sure that the man could go nowhere before saying ennervate the death eater eyes slowly popped open and he struggled against the bindings but he didntmove ron examined his face he had seen him before they had had brief encounters during the battle at hogwarts and now that he thought about it at the wedding too but ron did not know this man name i ve got you ron panted now you re going to answer my questions i silencio i dontwant to hear it you ll answer my questions with the truth and i ll consider letting you live ron said first off what use am i to voldemort he lifted the silencing charm i i dontknow yes you do ron yelled and then punched him the death eater fought against the invisible ropes for a moment before stilling i dontknow anything he maintained you re a liar ron said shite this wasntgoing to go anywhere ron needed to get this bloke to talk he needed veritaserum he had lived with joe no it had never been joe he told himself long enough to know where certain potions were kept now that he thought about it it was the same place his mum kept them his mum didnthave veritaserum in her collection of course but she didnthave much of anything other than minor first aid potions to begin with he got up and rushed to the cupboard that the potions were stored in and was shocked by how many of them looked as if they housed dark contents how had he not picked up on the hints before what kind of person kept such things lying around the house after rummaging through them for a moment he thanked merlin that he d paid a little bit of attention in at least a few potions classes because he was able to recognize veritaserum fairly easily he went back to where he d left the death eater and was more than a little relieved to see that he hadntescaped somehow ron knelt down and after a struggle poured a liberal amount of the potion into the man mouth the man wouldntswallow however and ron was forced to plug his nose if the man wanted to breathe again he d have to swallow sometime the man put up a valiant effort but eventually he swallowed what is your name ron asked after giving it a moment to kick in he tried to remember everything harry had ever told him about the encounter with the fake mad eye moody after the triwizard tournament i wont i no what is your name i amycus carrow who are you loyal to th the dark lord did he tell you to kill me tonight indirectly what does that mean i have been meeting with lucius malfoy once a week to update him on our progress so malfoy gave you the order asked ron yes said amycus why didntyou just kill me in the first place we he wanted to use you amycus said who is he the dark lord and how did he plan on using me the imperius cruse i was instructed to erase your memory and then put you under the imperius if you had succeeded what would you have made me do ron inquired i was to train you to fight for our side gasped amycus we were going to use you to hurt potter hurt him how attack him make him think you d turned to our side said amycus make him weak both physically and mentally the dark lord would do the rest ron paused for a moment is harry potter dead he is still alive ron sighed in relief is the war over no it is far from over why did lucius malfoy order you to kill me tonight i realized that you were remembering more and more and that your mind was working against the memory modifying charms we d preformed when i passed my concerns on to lucius he said that we couldnttake the chance he told me to eliminate you a are my parents dead no what about my sister ginny she is alive my brothers they re alive all of them and hermione asked ron knowing that the next answer he received would be the most important one i dontknow who that is i the mudblood he said cringing you said snape killed her is that true no you lied then yes ron took a moment to collect himself you said your name was amycus he asked yes said the death eater what did you do with the real joe amycus joe is dead said amycus who killed him keeping him alive grew to be too difficult i killed him last week did you like that asked ron did you enjoy killing him yes actually i did you sick fuck ron cried he looked around trying to come up with more questions to ask he noticed that the fire had nearly reached the doorway to kitchen he didnthave much time left deciding that it wasntworth the risk he stood up that about all i want to know ron said ron wondered how he should deal with this situation at hand if he let amycus go back to voldemort he d be chained up and tortured to insanity before ron got back to the burrow but ron hated this man he hated him more than he d ever hated anyone else in his entire life and didntsomeone as terrible as this deserve that sort of end still he couldntlet amycus go voldemort would punish him probably extensively but voldemort might give him the chance to redeem himself he might make amycus do something huge to prove himself again and ron couldntlet him hurt anyone else ron knew who the target would be next time and he d sooner die than have hermione go through this that really was what it came down to it was between hermione and this stranger in his mind eye he could picture hermione lying in the hospital wing after the department of mysteries he could hear harry voice echoing in his head saying when dolohov hit her with that curse i thought she was dead ron i really did and although dolohov had been the one to hurt hermione that time he wasntthe only one who d wanted to this bloke clearly didntobject to torturing ron and killing joe what would he do to hermione the one with the muggle parents the one they probably considered a weak little girl if he had the chance he took one last look around and then disapparated to the safe outdoors away from the fire knowing that amycus had no way of escaping and knowing that he d be halfway home by the time anyone discovered that there had been a fire at joe house that night ah the moment we ve all been waiting for disclaimer i dontown harry potter clearly chapter twenty eight the homecoming harry mm you have to get up no yes but it so early i know love but you have training harry groaned no i don t he said pulling the covers over his face it saturday he heard ginny sigh and he stuck his head out from under the blanket to look at her she frowned and brushed the hair off his forehead it is she asked she laughed bitterly i donteven know what day of the week it is anymore how messed up is that gin this isntnatural she said i dont i dontknow how much longer i can take this she shifted and lay back down i forget hogwarts she said looking at him with wide eyes no you don t he said it wasnt that long ago was it i do she insisted i mean i remember what the castle looks like from the outside but i forget the feeling i d get in my stomach when the stairs would start to change with me on them and i forget how pretty the grounds used to look when they were covered with snow and how it felt to win the house cup or the quidditch cup she said i miss just sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold day with the rest of gryffindor nearly headless nick professor sprout hagrid shite this wasntgood harry wasntgood with girls when they when they acted like girls what could he say really he spent every monday through friday at hogwarts but he doubted that telling ginny that would cheer her up at all i i know harry said and it was a lie but it was one that he thought ginny needed to hear but we ll go back y know once this is over we can all go back it ll be better than ever we wonthave to read about death eater attacks in the daily prophet every morning we wonthave potions with snape we ll win that quidditch cup again and we can skip dinner to snog in empty classrooms she smiled weakly and looked away yeah she said we ll get to do that again but ron wont i guess that what got me so upset i already starting to forget hogwarts what if i forget him too you won t he said automatically how do you know she asked why did she have to keep asking questions that he couldntanswer he looked at her helplessly and she sighed oh harry i sorry she said i just had a bad sleep i guess forget i said anything okay i dontwant to become one of those whiney girls who cry all the time or anything he wanted to tell her that there was a difference between those girls and her and that she shouldntever worry about how she acted around him but then she leaned forward and kissed him hard and his mind went blank my mum she said against his mouth when one of his hands which had been resting on her stomach began to push up her shirt she wontbe up for hours he said mm okay she said and her breathing quickened monday afternoon found ginny and hermione in the sitting room it chilly outside ginny said looking out the window at least it looks chilly huh said hermione she looked up from her book i said that it looks cold said ginny you know outside oh hermione said and then cast a glance out the window yes yes it does start cooling off in september ginny didntknow what was more pathetic the fact that she and hermione couldnteven seem to carry out a conversation these days or that she was surprised to realize that it was in fact september previous septembers had always consisted of going to school and getting back into the swing of things this time around however ginny was stuck inside of the burrow with nobody to talk to other than hermione and her mum sometimes even her dad and harry it doesntfeel like it really september said ginny does it she added because she was starting to wonder if maybe she was slowly going crazy and the rest of them remained unaffected no hermione said after a long pregnant pause it doesn t hermione eyes fell back to the pages of her book and ginny desperate to maintain some shred of communication with the girl who used to be so much like a sister to her said so so hermione echoed but didntlook up this time ginny cast around for a topic it nearly your birthday isntit hermione looked up you know what she said slowly it is nearly my birthday she laughed softly i suppose i forgot a year ago someone forgetting their own birthday would ve been some sort of crime to ginny but being that her own birthday had gone mostly unnoticed this year she was rather unsurprised that hermione was on the verge of going down that same path we should do something special said ginny eighteen isntthat the important one for muggles yeah said hermione actually last summer mum and dad had talked about taking a family trip to australia just before this term started up to celebrate but it never did and with everything that happened we sort of forgot all about it i guess well ginny said lamely anything we do wontbe as nice as australia but we can have some cake and presents hermione smiled that sounds lovely because you know ginny continued i just think with ron d dying and harry never being here that it would be nice if we could have one day where we all settled in and had some of mum chocolate cake and shared a few laughs hermione didntseem to hear much of that sentence she frowned and set her book down in her lap i not insane you know she said calmly when i say that ron is alive it not because i ve gone round the bend he really is trust me ginny if he was dead i would accept it but he isn t i can feel it and i think you believe me i think you might even feel it too but you dontwant to admit it to yourself a part of ginny a tiny almost insignificant part but a part nonetheless believed that ron was alive or maybe that part just desperately wanted him to be either way ginny was not comfortable with where this conversation was headed maybe ginny said you re right maybe my brother is alive but maybe he isn t maybe he dead personally i think i d rather believe that he dead hermione eyes widened why would you say that because said ginny if he alive that means that he deliberately staying away from us that means that he knows we think he dead that he knows we re all upset and hurting and he isntbothering to come home or even send us a letter telling us that he okay my brother could be a real prat sometimes but he wouldntever be that inconsiderate and i think it a disgrace to his memory for me to believe that he out there and choosing not to be with us hermione eyes flashed i not trying to disgrace his memory she said firmly maybe there an explanation maybe he alive but he captured maybe he alive but he needs our help and we arentgoing to give it to him because nobody believes me when i say he isntdead and we should be out there looking for him you think asked ginny you think that ron is being tortured right now hermione drew in a breath yes maybe i not sure i think it definitely a possibility and it the only possible explanation then why said ginny cantyou feel it and when hermione didnthave an answer ginny left the room ready harry asked kingsley harry nodded and braced himself ready he said kingsley raised his wand legilimens harry was eight being chased through the schoolyard by dudley and his friends as the rest of the kids looked on and laughed he was in madam malkin s listening as malfoy went on and on about quidditch and houses and other things he d never heard of before he was listening as cho chang told him she was going to the yule ball with cedric diggory he was in dumbledore office throwing things around the room feeling as though he might burst from all the hate he felt he was kissing ginny in the common room while all of gryffindor looked on harry was on his knees in the great hall kingsley was staring down at him his wand clutched tightly in his right hand good start he said though harry didntfeel encouraged in the least again harry panted not realizing he was out of breath until he struggled to speak legilimens he heard his mother crying pleading for her son life and then there was a flash of green light voldemort ordered wormtail to kill the spare and then cedric diggory was lifeless on the cold hard ground he was watching on helpless as sirius fell through the veil and disappeared onto the other side for ever more he tried to move but he was stuck fast and snape was raising his wand to professor dumbledore worn figure and there was another flash of green and then his hero was tumbling off the astronomy tower the battles around him were fast and harsh but ron seemed to move in slow motion as he jumped in front of ginny and disappeared once again harry was on his knees he sighed in frustration this takes time kingsley said softly and harry did not miss the disturbed tone in his voice upon seeing all those awful things from harry mind we can take a break if you d like no harry said let keep going legilimens he and ron were going off to hogwarts for the first time and a ten year old ginny weasley was running alongside the train he was in the chamber of secrets choking on panic as he noticed ginny lying on the floor looking so much younger than eleven ginny was fourteen demanding that she follow him to the department of mysteries she was fifteen and they were dancing at the wedding and he was telling her he loved her and couldntstand to put her in danger any longer she was sixteen and underneath him moaning him name harry wasnton his knees this time but he was breathing so heavily that he thought his lungs might burst his head was throbbing like no tomorrow when harry looked up kingsley mouth was a tight line and he instantly regretted not moving on when it had been suggested um said kingsley looking somewhat uncomfortable if you could just give me a moment harry wait here kingsley left the great hall and harry cursed he shouldnthave let kingsley see that ginny would kill him if she knew he stood there trying to come up with a way to undo the damage of what had just happened when mcgonagall came in looking rather severe indeed good afternoon potter she said and harry cringed in the passing weeks mcgonagall had taken to calling him by his first name he didnthave to think too hard to come up with a reason why she would have suddenly switched back again good afternoon professor said harry i just spoke with mr shacklebolt and he said some things that i found rather interesting she said dangerously it seems that there is one more thing i will need to teach you er what that he asked the contraceptive charm she said harry blanched oh he knew what that was for he d never needed it of course but that didntmean he d never heard of it before the you um i dont understand that i am not giving you any sort of permission here she said still this is something you will need to know sooner or later and i have a feeling that in this case it will be sooner harry had never been so mortified in his life p professor i i assume i do not need to outline the reasons why one should use the contraceptive charm she said flatly harry just gaped at her he couldnteven begin to imagine the shade of red he d turned intercourse potter she said i know harry said quickly i know what it is i just is it really necessary to yes pay attention now draw your wand and repeat after me harry said mrs weasley when harry came home that night good you re home arthur and i have to go to headquarters for some sort of emergency meeting yeah harry said professor mcgonagall explained it to me before i left right said mrs weasley well hermione and ginny are already in bed i think if you hear any noises or he knows dear said mr weasley yes but it doesnthurt to say it again she said remember harry if anything happens grab the girls and floo to headquarters as quickly as you can do not try to be a hero something about her words stung harry and he caught himself just in time he didntwant to snap at mrs weasley especially since she d only been trying to keep him safe with her speech i i ll be careful he said good night he went upstairs wondering why mrs weasley would feel the need to remind him that he shouldntbe a hero and now that he thought back on it he realized that mr weasley had lectured him about this same thing last time they had to attend a meeting and leave harry and the others behind honestly did they think he enjoyed trouble did they think he liked always having to be the hero and really did they think that he d ever jeopardize hermione or ginny safety and make them stay at the burrow were it to be attacked simply because he d want to defend their house are you alright harry he jumped realizing for the first time that he d found his way into ginny room huh he said you seem upset ginny said she went over to him and put a hand on his cheek is everything okay oh he said no i mean yeah i fine i had occlumency training today it takes a lot out of me ginny nodded sympathetically your mum said you were sleeping no i ve been doing some reading said ginny come on she pulled him over to the bed are you going to read to me he asked amused no silly she said arms up harry stared at her for a moment before realized she meant his arms he lifted them and allowed her to pull off his shirt you know you may not feel great after training with tonks but you do look rather nice she said and then squeezed the newly formed muscle of his bicep harry grinned like that do you he reached out and unbuttoned her shirt she raised her eyebrows you re not the only one who gets to enjoy the view he said ginny smiled fine she unzipped her pants and pulled them off in one smooth motion well she asked her hands finding their way to her hips harry smirked and dropped his own trousers get on the bed she ordered oh i think i like this side of you he teased ginny rolled her eyes grinning widely he sat on the edge of the bed shaking her head ginny pushed him so he was flat on his back roll over she said he obliged he felt her straddle his lower back and he sighed contentedly when she put her hands on his shoulders trying to work out the knots too bloody tense she muttered to herself you need to relax harry harry felt a stirring down below and groaned when she moved her hands to the small of his back doing this to me isntexactly helping you know he said and although he couldntsee her he knew she was smiling rather wickedly well humour me now and maybe i ll help you really relax when i through he shifted slightly to relieve pressure on er certain areas and gave into her touch her hands moved slowly over him and he knew she was trying her hardest to drive him insane and it was working when she was finished with her assault on his senses really the term backrub didntapply because her hands definitely hadntstayed on his back he turned over and she straddled his hips again then leaned down to kiss him she kissed his mouth his neck his chest gently nipping at his skin and brushing her fingers against him with the lightest of touches she rubbed her lower body against his and his head was swimming he closed his eyes and panted in reaction to her touch his mind screaming that he should stop but it was too good and he couldntstop not when she was grinding against him like that and looking down at him like she wanted to it took all his willpower but he managed to put his hands on her hips and stilled her he was so hot and so desperate for release but this wasntright and how could he be sure really that this was what ginny wanted maybe he said his voice sounding rough to his own ears maybe this isnta good idea tonight he said softly why she asked and harry thought she sounded fed up with him i i want you so much he said and if you keep doing that i not going to be able to control myself ginny snorted no really i wontbe able to stop and and i dontwant us to do something that you dontwant to do because harry ginny said shut up i i dontwant you to stop yourself she doesntmean that he told himself still he felt a pang of desire shoot through him at her words the other day we almost we almost made love and you stopped us you said that i wasntready for that and maybe i wasn t but i ve thought about it and i am now i want to i want to be with you really be with you he rolled them over and looked down at her you re sure he asked he knew that the question was redundant that they d talking about this more than just tonight and she would never have said anything if she hadntbeen sure but he still needed to ask it wouldntdo well if she stopped him halfway through because she was having second thoughts would it yeah she said and then smiled i love you hermione couldntsleep she wandered down to the kitchen to get a snack and maybe it was just a coincidence maybe it was just perfect timing or maybe it was much much more hermione had never ever bought into the silly little things that most children her age had while her muggle friends gushed over what santa claus had brought them for christmas hermione had smiled and tried to ignore the voice in her mind saying reindeers cantfly and there no way one person can visit every house in one night and even if it was possible where does he store the presents the next christmas she d waited up all night and just when she was starting to question her lack of belief she d heard it her parents instead of being devastated at the slight loss of innocence hermione had smiled a nice big smile and finally allowed her eyes to drift shut she d been right when she d lost her first tooth her parents had been very pleased and the next morning when she d awoken to money under her pillow she knew that it was from her mum and not the so called tooth fairy she had lacked hardcore evidence though and it sent her on a mission when she wasnteating or sleeping she was wiggling that second tooth the one that showed the most promise of falling out soon her parents told her not to force it but hermione was determined finally after a week and a half that second tooth fell out again that night she d forced herself to stay awake she didntknow how long she d waited there but finally she heard the telltale turn on the doorknob and creak of the floorboards surely the tooth fairy would have more stealth than that still when her mum slipped that dollar under her pillow she pretended to be asleep and her mum was none the wiser that was how things worked for hermione granger even at a young age she relied on logic it wasntlogical to think that one person could deliver presents to every single child in the world in just one night or that a tooth fairy would actually take teeth in exchange for money where did the funding for all those lost teeth come from that was why when it came to this business with ron she couldntunderstand why she didntsee logic it was illogical or maybe it was so insane that it was sane so inconceivable that there was really no other option that made sense and because of this new irrational but somehow still rational attitude of hers she didntdo what she should have done when she heard a strange knock at the door every logical part of her brain screamed that she should run up to find harry and ginny that she should floo to headquarters and bring mr weasley back home just incase this person knocking on their door in the middle of the night didnthave the best intentions but the logical part of her brain had been put on mute it seemed so she tiptoed her way to the door and asked wh who there hermione she nearly jumped out of her skin the shiver the prickly feelings that shot through her were almost enough to make her knees give out she knew that voice oh merlin did she know that voice but no she had to use some logic if it was just her at risk she would rip open that door right now but harry and ginny would also been in danger if her intuition was failing her now and she couldntdo that who there who a are you she asked again hating how her voice was shaky and afraid and all but screaming is it really you have you finally come home i i ron hermione please let me in dontbe freaked out the voice said he started rambling probably trying to get her to believe him and to open the door but she was already on the job she couldntunlock the door fast enough shaky hands desperately clawed and grasped at each one and then finally she was turning the doorknob and opening the door and there he was with a nasty black eye looking wild and dirty and tired and not quite right but right enough that it was him ron her ron and then her knees really did give out and she would ve tumbled to the floor but he caught her and held her to him hermione he croaked oh fuck i sorry i sorry i so fucking sorry there were so many things she wanted to know where had he been how had he gotten back why in the world did he need to be sorry did he mean it before when he d said he loved her did he still mean it now why hadnthe come home sooner what did he plan on doing if she hadntlet him in what did he plan on doing now that she had let him in all she could do was open her mouth and then sob too happy and too confused and just too fucking exhausted to do anything but sink against him and bury her face in his chest hadntshe said that ron was alive somewhere hadntthey all told her that she was wrong that she was crazy and in denial and being an idiot i she gasped against him i i was you were what he whispered and it sounded as if he was maybe crying too if only just a little bit i w was right she exclaimed this wasntgood no this was good ron being back was the best thing she had ever and would ever know but the way her heart was beating a mile a minute the way she could hear the blood rushing in her head the way she had to fight for each breath the way she couldnteven support herself on her own two feet oh no she was going to pass out she was going to have a heart attack no she had to be okay she had to stay with ron she had to find something to focus on instead of the dizziness and the nausea and the suffocation stupefy hermione stumbled but managed to grab onto the kitchen table and keep on her feet as ron fell to the floor she looked up in horror and found ginny and harry staring at her with wide eyes they d stunned ron she pulled out her wand and pointed it at his fallen form ennervate get away from there hermione ginny yelled as ron stirred that not ron yes it is hermione shouted harry glared at her and began again stupe but no she wouldntlet him stun ron again stupefy she shouted so quickly that she took herself by surprise and harry fell before he could even get out the entire spell harry ginny cried she looked up at hermione with shock and yes just a little bit of hate revive him right now she demanded why so he can do the same thing to ron asked hermione she felt ron stand up behind her that isntron ginny screamed damn it hermione ron is dead you revive harry now or you ll be seeing my brother again sooner than you think ginny ron said harshly and his voice was rough but it was the same and how could harry and ginny not tell that this was ron ginny i you ginny exclaimed pointing at ron you shut up you are not my brother and how dare you she stopped when ron pulled out his wand and pointed it at harry you get away from him she screamed making her way to ron with hate in her eyes i mean it i swear i ll kill you if you so much as ennervate he said and ginny stared at him with her mouth open in surprise hermione you shouldnthave done that he lectured harry gave a small groan and then sat up he looked at the scene before him and then jumped to his feet accio wand he yelled stretching out his hand when it floated into the kitchen and harry grasped it in his hand he muttered incarcerous ron fell again but remained conscious ginny fell to her knees and grabbed the wand from his hand then grabbed hermione arm and dragged her back to the other side of the kitchen where harry was who are you harry demanded that ron hermione yelled why couldntthey accept that all this time they d told her she was crazy that she had no proof that ron was alive now he was there in front of their eyes and she was still the crazy one harry ginny said quietly he revived you it wasntme so harry asked that doesntmean that he ron i know ginny said but hermione thought that maybe ginny wasntsure one way or the other anymore i just still who are you harry asked again it me said ron harry repeated the question ron weasley damn harry dontyou even recognize your best mate hermione frowned because ron attitude was not going to help anything ginny let go of hermione arm and took a step forward careful harry warned but let her move i have a scar ginny said on the back of my neck it from ron weasley and if you are him you should be able to tell me how you gave me it ron said nothing for a moment and hermione silently urged him on why wasnthe answering well asked ginny still moving toward him i cantanswer that ron said softly no no this wasnthappening hermione heart sank if he couldntanswer a simple question what if this wasntron was that possible why not asked ginny my brother would know the answer are you telling me that it a trick question snapped ron it was fred not me and you know that ginny shoulders squared slightly and hermione thought she looked like a small frightened child as she turned her back to ron and walked over to harry with an uneasy expression if harry noticed any of this he didntshow it i going to stand here for an hour harry said and once that polyjuice potion wears off we ll know who you really are fine ron said but it really me then where have you been ginny blurted out and all hermione could do was watch this entire thing play out knowing that she would just have to be patient and wait until the hour was up and they realized that ron wasntpolyjuiced silencio said harry and ron mouth moved without sound dontlisten to a thing he has to say it all lies he looked back at ron if i were you i d start thinking of an escape plan once this hour is up you re dead we have to do something said ginny if mum and dad come home early and see this you re right harry sighed i ll go get my invisibility cloak he handed ginny his wand watch these two ginny nodded get my wand too she said harry left and ginny waited a moment before lifting the silencing charm i dontcare what harry said she said you re going to answer my questions i dontbelieve that you re my brother she said in a shaky voice but fred did give me that scar and i want to know how you know that ginny he said in a pleading voice it me you have to believe me i don t she said but oh she wanted to and maybe she did just a little bit no he lying dontlisten to him but it was too late she was already selling herself on the idea that her brother was home it was such a nice idea too and so easy to believe if she just closed her eyes and allowed herself to dream when we were younger i asked if you had any idea that the person talking through your diary was tom riddle the person pretending to be ron said you told me that you didn t and i believed you and now you need to believe me please this is ron said hermione ginny could see the desperation in her eyes i ve said it all along it really him look at him cantyou feel it ginny didnt know this was all happening so fast if this was really ron then where had he been all this time why hadnthe rushed home weeks ago she knew they were both waiting for her answer but she was so confused and so afraid that this wasnther brother that this was a death eater who had hermione and maybe even herself a little bit wrapped around his finger i know how insane this looks said the stranger and i dontblame you for not believing me but you have to let me explain i i donteven know how long i ve been gone or what happened around here but why cantyou all just give me a fucking chance you re acting like you would if malfoy walked into our house for all i know said ginny you could be malfoy i understand that ron said exasperatedly but would malfoy know that you have a scar on the bottom of your left foot from when you were five and you stepped on a piece of glass when the twins broke mum favourite vase the one auntie muriel gave her he remembered that ginny didnteven remember that day the story had been told to her years later and she d laughed but hadntbeen able to recall it would he remember staying up all night in grimmauld place after harry had a dream about dad and that snake would he remember getting completely smashed for harry birthday or going to romania to look for that horcrux dontlisten to him she ordered herself they could ve tortured ron until he gave them this sort of information this doesntmean that ron alive this doesntmean that ron is in front of you right now but even as she ordered herself not to believe she could feel her resolve crumbling she looked up at hermione who nodded encouragingly and ginny wanted to do something anything that would help her be sure one way or the other but she could hear harry coming back into the kitchen and she didntwant him to know that she had betrayed him and talked to this imposter what if he wasntan imposter silencio she said just in time harry came in and threw the cloak over ron hermione he said what the hell were you thinking letting him in here we would all be dead right now if ginny and i hadntcome downstairs in time no we wouldn t said hermione this is ron i told you ron was alive and you said i had no proof she gestured to the floor what more proof do you need ron is in this room that isntron you dontknow that she cried why are you doing this dontyou want ron to be alive more than anything harry yelled i wish everyday that it was me and not him but that doesntmean we can jump every time someone who for all we know could be working for voldemort shows up and claims to be someone that we had a funeral for harry had a good point but then again so did hermione ginny didntknow what to believe anymore she forced herself to be objective if that was ron that would be better than amazing but if it wasnt she would have a hard time getting over it it was best not to get her hopes up like harry was trying to do still hermione shot him a dirty look and folded her arms across her chest what do we do now she asked harry sat down at the kitchen table and looked at the clock we wait he said he didntunderstand it the hour was up ten minutes ago but when he d lifted the cloak expecting to see the face of a big ugly death eater it was still ron lying on the floor but this couldnt be ron ron was dead he wished with everything in him that it wasnttrue but it was and pretending and stalling and making excuses werentgoing to make that fact any easier to cope with that it isntit asked ginny i mean there no other reason why he could be a metamorphmagus harry said instantly before she had the chance to finish her thought ginny frowned and he hated the fact that he had maybe just crushed a bit of her but he had to be realistic it wouldntdo well for him to declare that this was ron go shouting it from the rooftops and give mrs weasley back her son only to end up killed in the middle of the night by ron who was really a death eater keeping up the act long enough to do voldemort bidding he didntfancy the role he had to play but he also knew that he was the only one out of the three of them who would be willing to do it he and ginny had started out on the same team but she must have swayed because she was now sitting firmly on the fence he couldntblame her it wasntas though he didnt want to believe hermione words but he had to be the bastard right now because he just barely handled losing his best mate once and he wasntsure if he d be able to do it a second time and he knew that ginny and hermione wouldntstand a chance in hell this is ridiculous hermione said she used her wand to lift the silencing spell put on ron what do you have to say for yourself ginny asked holding out her hand to stop him when harry made to put the spell back on veritaserum the stranger croaked give me some it ll prove we donthave any harry said there probably some at hogwarts hermione suggested let go we cantjust leave harry said what ll mr and mrs weasley think when they come home and we re all gone we ll leave them a note said ginny we ll say we went to hogwarts besides we ll probably be back before they get home anyway he wasntsure it was the brightest idea in the world but what else could they do they needed that veritaserum after writing a note that harry figured was acceptable he levitated the stranger and they all traveled to hogwarts by floo the castle was colder than it was in the day and beside him ginny shivered and wrapped her arms loosely around herself hermione was walking ahead of them beside ron talking a mile a minute but harry couldnteven begin to comprehend what she was saying it didntmatter anyway because she was only talking to ron hey harry said taking ginny hand she looked up and he wasntsurprised to see tears running down her cheeks are you okay that i think that ron she said quietly he cursed what had hermione done to her while he d been upstairs shite this was going to kill ginny if this person didntturn out to be ron ginny no she said i i know you re trying to be practical and not get your hopes up and all that other rubbish but but can you honestly look at me and say you dontfeel it that something about this entire situation is just right he knows things harry things that only he could know about me and about you and about hermione about the horcruxes how do you know she looked down i while you were out of the room i asked him some questions and and she said he answered them all correctly she sighed i not going nutty like hermione although really it might turn out that hermione isntso nutty after all we dontknow yet harry said one way or the other we donthave an answer so so dontget your hopes up okay too late i think ginny said closing her eyes momentarily do you think there will be any already brewed veritaserum hermione asked over her shoulder let hope said ginny it takes ages to brew doesntit we need it now they made their way to snape office and after rummaging through the countless different potions they found what they were looking for got it hermione cried she handed it to harry and he checked the label it was veritaserum all right his hand shook as he poured a few drops into the stranger mouth they waited a moment to let it kick in okay said harry ready ready said hermione ginny nodded and gripped harry arm who are you he asked ronald bilius weasley said the person on the floor ginny nails dug painfully into harry arm for a moment before relaxing again maybe they hadntwaited long enough maybe the veritaserum hadntstarted working yet or maybe this really was ron who am i asked harry harry potter said ron when and where did we meet it was at king cross the first of september 1991 said ron you you didntknow how to get onto the platform my mum helped you and then we sat together on the train and who am i asked hermione hermione granger said ron with a smile and when did we meet on the train you came into our compartment trying to find neville toad and ended up laughing at my sorry attempt to do magic what magic did you try to do harry asked i tried to turn my rat whiskers yellow didntwork very well though harry looked up at ginny and hermione all of their questions had been answered correctly what happened on halloween of our first year asked hermione you were sulking in the toilets said ron harry and i saved your arse from that troll then you saved our arses from mcgonagall who was fluffy the three headed dog said ron nasty little bugger what was it guarding the philosopher stone how did we manage to get past it played some music that put it right to sleep what happened on the train when we were going to hogwarts for our second year asked harry dunno said ron and neither do you we took dad car because we couldntget through the barrier crashed into the whomping willow with it broke my wand in half nearly got expelled bloody brilliant if you ask me harry could not contain his smile at the memory what is the purpose of the whomping willow asked hermione underneath it is an underground tunnel to the shrieking shack professor lupin goes down there every full moon have you ever been down there in third year sirius dragged me down there and you both followed that was the night wormtail got away who did you go to the yule ball with padma patil who did you want to go with asked ginny hermione he said instantly and hermione grinned how many times did you have to take your apparation test before passing questioned hermione twice i left my eyebrow behind the first time ron said with a smile have you ever been to romania asked harry yeah said ron to visit charlie asked harry he couldntcome right out and say to look for horcruxes because even though there was no reason to believe that this wasnt ron there was still a chance and harry had to be very careful about throwing around such information no you git said ron to get that horcrux we all had quite a time of it too hermione got hurt pretty badly remember that scary as hell ginny took a deep breath when you disappeared where did you go she asked where have you been all this time why didntyou come back sooner the pain in her voice was obvious and ron flinched i i was in america he said some death eater amycus he said his name was erased my memory or he tried to at least it worked for a while i couldntremember any of you i couldntremember my own name amycus pretended to be a man named joe he befriended me and let me stay in his house with him you know so he d be able to keep tabs on me without tipping me off i guess he sighed i started getting flashes i was remembering things but it wasntenough i couldntfigure out who i was where i was from anything and then one night i remembered i remembered everything and amycus must ve figured it out he tried to kill me he he said that you were all dead and that they had no use for me anymore i nearly believed him too hermione gasped what happened she asked how did you get away it wasnteasy let me tell you said ron i had to fight him and i kicked his arse imagine that i slipped him some veritaserum and made him tell me everything he said voldemort yeah i said it voldemort wanted to wipe my mind clean and then put me under the imperius so i d fight harry and and do all this other rubbish he said that he realized it wasntgoing to be as easy as they d hoped and when he told malfoy about my slow progress malfoy ordered him to just up and kill me so what did you do asked ginny where amycus now well he dead ron said slowly you mean that you ginny harry said sharply ginny stopped talking and looked at him with wide eyes he shook his head telling her to back off if ron killed amycus that was his business not theirs he did what he had to do harry would have probably done the same thing to a monster who d deliberately kept him away from his family and friends for so long well asked hermione do you believe him now harry cleared his throat i i dontsee how he could be lying i mean unless what we gave him wasntveritaserum but it was he added quickly upon seeing hermione tired expression what should we do now asked ginny and she sounded like a small child seeking reassurance from a parent that no there wasntactually a monster under her bed letting me out of these bindings would be a nice start ron piped up hermione raised her eyebrows and harry nodded in assent pulling out her wand hermione released ron from the spell that held him down and he stood looking hesitantly at harry you re really back then harry asked and already he could feel that uncomfortable burning sensation behind his eyes as he thought about what that statement truly meant yeah ron said softly so softly that harry hardly heard him i really back harry nodded and then felt it that awful wave of dizziness that he d experienced only after particularly bad injuries that left him generally oozing blood from his head or arm or stomach and then everything went black as he passed out review disclaimer i dontown harry potter no i didntdie but my computer did argh no internet access for nearly two weeks i attempted writing out the chapter on paper so it would be ready to go when my computer was fixed but it turns out i lazy and when faced with hand cramps i write incredibly shorter chapters chapter twenty nine ron oh bugger said ginny when harry collapsed what happened to him asked hermione she felt her heart catch in her throat was he okay she had just gotten ron back she couldntlose harry she knew that she was overreacting and that harry had probably just fainted but she obviously wasntthinking clearly ron was back she d been talking about it for weeks she d insisted for weeks that he was alive and nobody had believed her it was only now as she stood beside him that she began to realize that a part of her hadntbelieved everything she d said but she had been right of course she was always right it was no surprise she didntplan on rubbing it in anyone face or anything like that but it was good to know that she hadntgone crazy even if everyone around her thought she had she felt triumphant in a way she hadntbefore this beat out anything she d felt in the past even when she d become a prefect or when she d received eleven owls he passed out of course ginny said with a small smile he wouldntbe harry if he didn t she looked at ron and sniffed are are you going to hug me now or what ron laughed softly and then pulled his sister toward him i love you he said c mon dontcry i no good with girls who cry i not crying ginny insisted even as her shoulder shook from the force of her sobs of course you aren t he said he held her tightly and hermione thought the sight of them together ron comforting ginny just as he had after the chamber of secrets and the department of mysteries and the battle at hogwarts was one of the sweetest things she d ever seen i missed you you git she said mum going to lose it i so sorry he said are you okay i fine you re here said ginny no said ron really are you okay i mean nothing happened at malfoy manor and you haventgone searching for horcruxes without me and and harry he treats you okay ginny nodded against him i what in the world is going on here hermione jumped and her eyes flew from ron and ginny professor mcgonagall stood there with her wand pointed out her mouth was a stern thin line her eyes were wide with shock and when she spotted ron she gave a rather audible gasp mr weasley professor ron said letting go of ginny and straightening out hermione took a moment to admire him he had a rather nasty black eye and a large gash on the side of his head he d been stunned by harry and tied up on his kitchen floor like an idiot he d been dragged to hogwarts and questioned by his friends though the things they d done had been quite necessary hermione knew that she d be feeling somewhat humiliated if she were in his situation ron was a proud person how had he not snapped had he grown up when had that happened miss weasley miss granger said mcgonagall she glanced down at harry unconscious form and then trained her wand on ron come away from there what asked ginny professor you dontunderstand this is my brother mcgonagall eyes nearly bulged out of her head what happened to mr potter he passed out said ginny we brought ron here hermione said trying to explain she knew that she would have to present a logical argument if there was ever any hope of mcgonagall believing them he showed up at the burrow tonight harry and ginny didntbelieve it was him at first we waited an hour to see if someone had just been polyjuiced after that harry thought that maybe this person was a metamorphmagus we brought him here and gave him some veritaserum it ron he answered all of our questions correctly and they were things that nobody except for him would know ginny nodded in agreement mcgonagall appeared to consider this for a moment did you think to use a recording charm on the conversation hermione frowned no she said honestly we didnteven think of it mr weasley is aware that we held a funeral for him asked mcgonagall and ron stiffened just a bit is he aware that we have not seen hide nor hair of him in over a month ron spoke up i know he said but i have an explanation for everything i was in america the death eaters were holding me there look you have no reason to believe me but mcgonagall nodded and went to say something but stopped miss weasley please help me escort harry to the hospital wing i believe he would be most comfortable in a bed a look of confusion crossed ginny features but she nodded and followed behind mcgonagall and a levitating harry for the first time since he d come back hermione was alone with ron she turned to look at him feeling incredibly awkward what was going on this was ron since when did she get nervous around him okay so she had been nervous around him many times but she was never this scared of him before hermione he said she bit her lip something occurred to her is the veritaserum still working she asked ron nodded do you mind if i ask you something no he said you can ask me anything i d tell the truth even if i hadnttaken the potion hermione knew this and it was what she was scared of still she had to ask it was better to be shot down than to be led on yeah did you mean it asked hermione her voice barely above a whisper i dontknow what you re talking about he said softly what you said to to me just before you left to go to malfoy manor she said did you mean it because i yes he said looking at her intently i of course i did i do i always have so why did you date lavender because i was in love with you he said hermione frowned that doesntmake any sense she said slowly i not the brightest person in the world ron said seriously you ll have to do better than that she said even though it didnteven matter to her right now all she wanted to do was let ron take her into his arms but she needed answers and it was better to get them sooner rather than later i i know i teased you about vicky all the time but but that was just to get you riled up anyone who knows us knows that we fight constantly but i like that about us so i set you off sometimes and i a git for doing it and i know that but i canthelp it he said then ginny said that you snogged vicky and and i knew that it was fourth year and that it was my fault for not asking you to go to the ball with me in the first place but it still felt like someone kicked me in the gut i dontknow why i thought that dating lavender would be a good idea i guess i just figured that you had no real reason to like me in the first place but i thought maybe you did anyway and and if you knew that i was rubbish when it came to girls and kissing and all that other shite i thought maybe you d realize that i wasntworth it at all he sighed and then you started up with mclaggen and i figured you never fancied me at all but that stupid and i not blaming you for anything if it hadntbeen for me you wouldnthave even looked twice at that git like i said i not the brightest lavender at the time she seemed like the answer it was only after she started calling herself my girlfriend and you wouldnteven look at me that i figured out the only reason you and i werenttogether was because of her she felt him grab her hand lavender isntmy girlfriend anymore he said hell she never really was hermione smiled what are you saying she asked though she thought maybe she already knew i saying that i not smart like you ron and i not funny like ginny or brave like harry or anything else really i just me he told her i have stupid red hair and i too tall i have too many family members and not enough money i act like an arse without even realizing it no you let me finish he said the moment i met you i told myself i hated you i told myself that you were bossy and annoying and just too bloody perfect at everything and i still couldntget you out of my head he said you infuriate me you re too smart and too proper and too stubborn you always lecture me in school you made me do my homework when all i wanted to do was play chess or go flying or sleep you made me do patrols you never let me take house points away from slytherin just because they were slytherins you have a ridiculous passion about house elves that i will never ever understand but you re all i think about even when i didntknow my name i knew you and i am so hopelessly in love with you that i actually standing here saying all this acting like some stupid wanker in those romance books my mum reads hermione felt her heart catch in her throat i i dontreally know what to say she confessed ron grinned and shrugged talking isnteverything he said and then pulled her to him he kissed her softly slowly and it was so long overdue that hermione wasnteven embarrassed when mcgonagall came back and interrupted them come with me she said where are we going asked hermione the answer turned out to be dumbledore office hermione was unsurprised to see professor dumbledore portrait mounted on the wall along with the other former headmasters she was surprised however at what he had to say ronald weasley dumbledore said brightly i was beginning to wonder if you would show up when harry awoke he was immediately greeted with an inexplicable gnawing sense of nervousness in the pit of his stomach he groaned and sat up he was in the hospital wing he d woken up here enough times to be able to identify the room with just a glance he looked around for madam pomfrey not realizing at first that she like the rest of the hogwarts staff was no longer at hogwarts he swallowed thickly and rubbed his eyes what happened why did he pass out ron ron was alive ron was back ron was alive and back and here at hogwarts right now how long had he been out was it the next day did the weasleys already know that ron was back or had it merely been a few minutes how had he gotten to the hospital wing then was mcgonagall back where was ginny harry found himself on his feet and felt around for his glasses until his fingers made contact and he put them on suddenly the nervousness was gone replaced with a quick rush of relief followed by excitement harry he spun around and saw ginny behind him he wasntsurprised it was almost as if he d sensed her coming up behind him gin you re up she said good come on we ve got to go where are we going mcgonagall got ron and hermione in dumbledore office she said the order up there too we have to meet them what did mcgonagall say asked harry she nearly had kittens said ginny she walked in right after you passed out she saw you on the floor and ron standing over you and she nearly hexed him into next week oh no harry hadnteven considered the thought that the adults other than the weasleys wouldntbelieve them would they have to do the veritaserum again wouldntthey have to wait until the last batch wore off how long would that take and how long would a second questioning take harry didntwant ron to spend another night away from the burrow can we go now he asked ginny nodded yeah she said mcgonagall brought you down here after we explained everything to her you ve been out about a half hour they began walking the only sound was that of their footsteps echoing off the stone walls to his right he heard ginny sniff and when he looked at her he could see through the faint lighting of the moon that she was crying is everything okay she sniffed again i just dontunderstand she said how could this have happen we held a funeral we mourned we were in emotional hell and we were wrong kingsley said he saw kingsley saw wrong obviously said harry they could ve polyjuiced some random person muggle probably and just killed them maybe they knew we were doing the wandering spell so they did it because they knew we d see there are a million different possibilities i dont know why this happened but it did and we need to just be thankful that everything turned out all right yeah she nodded my brother back she said i dontknow how but hermione was right all along what else is new she bit her lip i nervous i mean what going to happen next what if mum reacts badly what if nobody believes ron i cantlose my brother again harry you won t he said we ll make them believe he kissed her and took her hand isntyour mum going to panic when she gets home and sees that we arentthere mcgonagall spoke to her right after she found us here she told mum we had to talk to her about something and that we d be back soon mum probably worried sick of course but she knows that we re safe here okay harry said let go find ron and hermione finally up are you asked ron once ginny had returned to dumbledore office with harry in tow for a minute there i thought you d died or something hermione smacked his arm in reprimand but she was biting her lip against a smile harry let out a surprised scandalized laugh ginny couldnthelp but grin it was so unexpected and inappropriate it was such a ron thing to say and she could hardly take it mr weasley mcgonagall scolded let them have their fun minerva came dumbledore voice ginny jumped she still wasntused to the idea that professor dumbledore was living in one of those portraits there are so few reasons to laugh in today world what did i miss asked harry we questioned him said lupin as far as we can tell everything checks out what does that mean exactly ginny asked i mean what do we do now go home and get a good night sleep your family will need to be alerted of this immediately kingsley piped up it the middle of the night now though perhaps it would be best if you my mum will skin us alive if we wait until tomorrow to tell her this kingsley smiled of course he said what i meant to say was perhaps it would be best if you went home and told your parents now and let them decide how to tell your brothers ginny you you mean i have to be the one to tell them she asked her parents would never believe her they d just think she d gone as crazy as hermione of course she deserved it she d spent weeks treated hermione the same way cantone of you tell them they ll believe it if it comes from one of you tonks nodded sympathetically who would you rather hear this sort of news from she asked a member of the order or a member of your family the answer was of course that ginny would rather hear the news from a family member but wasntthe order just extended family there was no way around this one and she knew it nobody else could tell her mum and dad they wouldntbelieve hermione and they d both have heart attacks if ron suddenly walked into the kitchen and announced that he was home okay said ginny i ll go with you harry offered he grinned at her and ginny thought that he d better wipe that look off his face soon or it d be more than clear what they d been up to thanks she said and then she felt her face break out into the same expression harry held well said mcgonagall if everyone is satisfied here it would be best for mr weasley to be shown to the hospital wing i fine ron said you dontwant a potion to fix that black eye of yours asked tonks you ve got some nasty cuts too oh ron said yeah i guess that would be okay he looked at hermione you uh want to come with me no hermione declared nobody is going anywhere until professor dumbledore explains himself hermione lupin said what are you talking about yes ginny was rather curious herself why was hermione glaring at dumbledore it wasntlike her at all to disrespect authority miss granger perhaps you should it is quite all right minerva said dumbledore benevolently you are curious i presume at my reaction toward mr weasley return yes hermione said you werentshocked at all and you didnteven question whether or not it was really ron you defended him to the order it was almost as if you d known that ron was coming back the wheels were clearly turning in hermione head now but if that was true surely you would have told someone that he was still alive instead of letting us all suffer for so long wouldntyou which can only mean that you had no idea ron was still alive in which case why would you be so quick to believe me when i said ron was back everyone else wrote me off as crazy harry and ginny didntbelieve at first and ron had been standing right in front of them she paused for a moment you must have known something was up she concluded you must have been informed that something was going on with the other side and when you saw ron the pieces just came together ginny eyebrows nearly hit the ceiling how could hermione do that figuring everything out so easily as if someone was whispering the answers in her ear i have always said you are one of the brightest minds to ever attend this school dumbledore said when he said nothing more hermione prompted does that mean i right someone told you who a spy for our side pretending to be a death eater i am afraid i cannot allow this discuss to go any further dumbledore said looking around at them all but ginny could ve sworn he d winked when his eyes landed on her snape she felt harry grab her hand we should get back to the burrow he said your mum is probably waiting up for us worried sick ginny nodded and prepared herself for what was no doubt going to be an emotional next few hours where have you been mrs weasley demanded when ginny and harry entered the kitchen harry had been correct she was sitting at the table with a cup of tea ginny was relieved to see that her father was also awake this way at least they wouldnthave to waste time trying to get him out of bed and where is hermione hermione still at hogwarts harry said oi mum can we go now for the first time since coming into the room ginny realized that fred and george were present what re you doing here ginny asked mum showed up at our flat in the middle of the bloody night and started going off about how the three of you were missing finished george so fred said turning back to mrs weasley you know that they re all in one piece can we go now no said ginny it would be much easier to tell everyone the news if fred and george were there at least they would help control the situation and mrs weasley when she went insane no asked george c mon ginny we re tired big day at the shop tomorrow we re introducing a new line of it doesntmatter ginny said you should stay we harry and i have something to tell you all it kind of important and um it probably best if you all sit down bugger said fred harry gone and knocked you up hasnthe fred that isntfunny scolded mrs weasley she turned back to ginny with wide eyes you you re not pregnant are you p pregnant harry squeaked at the same time as ginny yelled no ignore them mr weasley said though he was blushing scarlet what do you need to tell us where is my son before ron even had the opportunity to register the voice as his mum s he was nearly tackled from behind he was then spun around and kissed pinched and prodded until he was beginning to wonder why he d been so anxious to see his mum ronnie was the only thing he made out before mrs weasley buried her face in his shoulder and dissolved into sobs mum he said and then awkwardly wrapped his arms around her it wasntas though he wasnthappy to see her no that was hardly the case but she was hugging him so tightly that he quite literally couldntbreathe ron looked over the top of his mum head and saw his father looking weary and still a little shocked by the revelation that his son was alive he came over and the three of them embraced and ron was glad that hermione had stayed in the great hall with tonks to give him a personal moment with his parents because he was quite sure he was crying harder than he d done before when his head was throbbing and his throat was sore he let go of his parents and wiped his eye can we go home now he asked and the thought of falling asleep in his bed tonight in his tiny room in his tiny house the one that was held up by magic and had a ghoul and so many other things that had always embarrassed him in the past was appealing in a way it had never been before review hopefully with march break upon me the next chapter will be out sooner disclaimer i dontown harry potter thanks for the reviews chapter three cleaning snogging discussing the next morning was beautifully executed hermione had to admit ginny crept into ron room bright and early around half six hermione she said quietly wake up when hermione stirred the first thing she saw was harry rubbing his eyes and yawning like an idiot he was grumbling something about just wanting to go to bed and threatening ginny by saying you better hope i able to get back to sleep gin hermione sat up and looked toward the window sun was creeping in through the shades she turned her attention back to ginny who was already fully dressed what is it she asked you have to get up and come to breakfast with me so mum doesntgo looking for you and find you in harry bed the youngest weasley explained hermione imagined the many different scenarios and the even more abundant conclusions that could be drawn from ron and ginny mum finding her like this would she naturally assume that harry had banished her here so he could be with ginny or would mrs weasley think that she and ron had masterminded it all even funnier than that last one was the thought that the reason hermione had spent the night in harry bed had something to do with a steamy love affair between her and the chosen one and that the rumors written by rita skeeter in their fourth year had been true oh right she said throwing the covers off of her and scrambling to her feet finally mumbled harry as he flopped down face first onto his rightful bed ginny rolled her eyes and him and threw a quick glance at her brother thanks for last night i didntplan on us falling asleep said ginny but hermione felt sure she was lying i hope my brother wasnttoo much of a prat about it no no he was lovely said hermione once the words left her mouth she wished she had used another adjective to describe ron why couldntshe have just said fine what in the world made her say lovely ron lovely ginny gave a laugh of disbelief hermione i thought you knew by now that it is next to impossible for those two words to appear in the same sentence hermione blushed and looked away hoping her friend would take pity on her and not mention anything else concerning the redhead sleeping but mere feet away the room fell into silence for a moment before a muffled snore rang out ginny giggled and pointed to harry hermione stared at the boy incredulously i take it mr potter found sleep rather easy to come by you think that bad at least the pillow is taking most of the damage this time i slept beside that all night i must have fallen asleep first or else there no way i would ve let him stay ginny laughed hermione sniggered and sucked in a breath when she thought she heard footsteps approaching after a few seconds of silence both girls listening intently ginny shook her head signalizing that she evidently thought the coast was clear well shall we leave our boys alone then asked ginny she nodded relishing the fact that ginny had called them their boys ron was not lavender boy he was hers he had always been hers it was just nice for that fact to finally get some recognition wait where did that come from did she really feel that way did she feel that ron was her territory and no other girl had any right to be trespassing there had always been something between her and ron she wouldntdeny that but to go so far as to say she wanted ron to be hers that was definitely something new they had been best friends for ages sure throughout that time she had had the occasional thought about what it would feel like to be his girlfriend those thoughts were mostly centered on fifth and sixth year of course but hermione thought they were perfectly normal for any male female best friendship she had always known that ron was funny and nice and most of all cute but she never gave it any further thought until the yule ball incident she remembered complaining to ginny about him saying that he was an overbearing prat ginny had just rolled her eyes and said if you canttell he bloody green with envy over that krum fellow i bet he kicking himself for not asking you to the ball when you were available that had been the first time she had truly looked at ron in an objective way once she thought there was a tiny chance that he might have feelings for her feelings that went past the friendship zone she was forced to re evaluate her own feelings suddenly the cute boy with dirt on his nose for when she thought of ron hermione had always conjured up the image of him on their first ride to hogwarts had become slightly taller considerably cuter and even more funny and nice the chance had been gradual no doubt but to hermione it seemed almost overnight ever since that moment she began noticing more and more things that she liked about ron she liked the way his hair was getting to the length where it still fell into his eyes no matter how many times he brushed it away she liked how loyal he was always risking his neck for harry she melted at the way he said her name the way he was so protective of his sister the way he used the occasional bad word even though she was offended on some level she had come to expect it from him and would even go so far as to say it was part of his character and she certainly liked his character she liked the way he thought she was brilliant and the way he told her so all the time even through simple gestures instead of coming right out and saying the words she liked the way he made her feel the way he served as her inspiration when things got stressful or particularly nasty she still to this day appreciated the way he backed her up when she suggested harry be the leader of the da she enjoyed watching him get defensive about quidditch but enjoyed the sparkle in his eyes when he talked about the chudley cannons even more most of all she liked it when they rowed hermione was a passionate person she cared deeply about things like s p e w things that ron couldntunderstand and when they fought they truly went at each other they said terrible things shouted at the top of their lungs didntspeak for days she d never admit it but it was part of the reason she felt so close to him so attracted to him when she finished showering and dressing she went downstairs to the kitchen yep hermione just had a bit of a lie in she should be down soon explained ginny she charlie mr and mrs weasley were already up and about morning all greeted hermione mrs weasley smiled at her from the stove i take it the boys are still asleep naturally ginny laughed honestly they dontwake up until ron smells food hermione read the daily prophet and chatted with the others for another half hour before fred and george came downstairs mrs weasley smiled at them and served breakfast i know it a little early to be eating she said but we have a lot to do today the wedding is happening very soon and as it to be held here we ll be cleaning the inside of the house today the twins groaned in protest mum that sounds lovely fred began unfortunately we re very busy today said george what with the shop and all continued fred business is booming you see explained george so we really cantstay long fred concluded oh said mrs weasley you boys are really doing well with that store of yours then fred and george nodded their mouths were full of food mrs weasley narrowed her eyes at them waved her wand and their food disappeared then perhaps you should feed yourselves bloody dirty trick that was fred mumbled as he scrubbed the floors ginny laughed as part of their punishment for saying some not so nice words at breakfast they were forbidden by their mother to use magic while cleaning you missed a spot she teased pointing to a random part of the floor ginny her mother called stop bothering your brothers and get in here yeah go find ron and bother him instead ordered george ginny stuck her tongue out at her brothers and skipped out of the room she went up the stairs and into the sitting room inside were hermione ron and harry looking around and mrs weasley enchanting the cloths to dust the tables and the carpets to float to the backyard and shake themselves out well dontjust stand there go upstairs and straighten up the kids bedrooms two of you can go up into the attic too instructed mrs weasley mum why do we need to do this it not like the guests at the wedding will be inspecting our attic i think our bedrooms are safe too y know groaned ron okay then mrs weasley began dontthink of it as preparing for the wedding think of it as cleaning the house that you all live in for free as a favour to your dear sweet mum honestly mum what are we house elves ron asked earning him a slap on the arm from hermione ginny giggled silently at her brother expression and lead the way up the stairs trying to block out hermione ranting about s p e w they began in fred and george room deciding that all four of them would need to work on it together before splitting off into groups hermione was exceptionally cautious not wanting another black eye anytime soon ginny was on guard hopefully looking to find anything that would alter her appearance knowing that phlegm would go ballistic if she was disfigured for the wedding she chuckled to herself at the thought ron and hermione whipped out their wands while she and harry sat on the bed playing with nosebleed nougats fainting fancies and blood blisterpods they collectively decided that the puking pastilles wouldntbe the best choice to play around with as it would only lead to a larger mess that ron and hermione would be forced to clean then again ginny thought that was a smashing idea she looked up at harry who was now staring off into space his brow furrowed his deep green eyes were fixated on a spot on the ceiling he absentmindedly ran his tongue over his bottom lip ginny could hardly contain herself the feelings she had for the boy in front of her were overwhelming she fancied harry potter sure but that didnteven begin to describe it perhaps by the time the summer was over she would love him even better maybe he could love her back the thought of harry saying those three words even now made her heart beat a little bit faster could it be that she already loved him it was hard to sort out your feelings for someone when you re around them all day everyday she was in that in between stage where you feelings are stronger than like but not quite love maybe he was there too she couldnttake it anymore he was far too sexy for his own good and the fact that he wasnteven trying to be only strengthened her attraction to him she threw a glance over her shoulder at hermione and her brother neither of which were paying any attention to her smirking to herself she put her hand on harry inner thigh he broke out of his trance and his eyes darted from her to ron and back again she leaned forward shifting her weight to her hand and kissed him full on the lips he hesitated obviously very aware that her brother was simply a few feet away from them and liable to turn around at any minute when ginny finally felt him kiss her back she pulled away a bit he looked at her with a mixture of confusion and desire she squeezed his thigh seductively before sitting back firmly on the bed at which time hermione turned around and gave them a questioning look after seeing harry flushed expression ginny turned to look at her and shrugged as if to say i dontknow what his problem is hermione cast them a suspicious disapproving look then went back to cleaning ginny turned back to harry who was grinning and shaking his head she made a face at him and smirked daring him to do something other than look at her like a bumbling idiot he raised his eyebrows rising to her challenge but not before casting a final fleeting glance at ron ginny leaned forward and kissed him again harry grabbed her body and pulled her closer so she was sitting in his lap what the hell ron and hermione could ve been doing for them to not notice her and harry snogging right in front of them ginny would never know maybe they were committing their own act of indiscretion just as ginny pushed him away and climbed off him ron turned around and gave the room the once over satisfied with their cleaning attempts he shrugged and put his wand back in his robes hermione followed suit and motioned for harry and ginny to move because they were done in the twins room the four friends wandered into the hall and looked at each other expectantly ginny and harry exchanged significant looks um i guess i ll take the attic he mumbled before leaving the hallway ginny waited until he was out of sight before she said i think i ll go help him the attic is a big job for one person ignoring hermione attempts to catch her eye she turned her back to them and followed the path harry had taken moments ago up to the attic of the weasley house harry waited for what seemed like hours he was almost positive that she wasntcoming that hermione had clued in and now the three of them were arguing about his relationship with ginny he heard footsteps it was ron he was sure of it ron was coming to kill him all because he snogged his sister it wasnteven his idea she had orchestrated the whole thing he had accepted that breaking up meant no more snogging but she didntwant that he didnt want it either mind you but it was different because he wasntgoing to do anything about it the first thing he saw was flaming red hair but the rest of the body quickly appeared and it was undoubtedly ginny she climbed the final few stairs and entered the dark dusty attic looking around for him harry darted out of his place his teenage hormones getting the better of him and pushed her against the wall attacking her neck that he kissed his way up to her face and across her jaw was he captured her lips pressing her ever harder against the wall of the weasley attic cruel ginny hands quickly found their way into his hair pulling him closer crushing their lips together harry was struggling to keep his cool being like this with ginny was a lot to take he cupped her bottom giving it an affectionate squeeze she moaned in his mouth her tongue working furiously against his own harry stomach did a flop as she gave a small hop and locked her legs around his torso she untangled one hand from his messy hair and ran it over his chest cruel yes but you liked it ginny said breathlessly their faces still inches apart damn right i did agreed harry but still in front of your brother what were you playing at if they had been caught which harry was surprised they hadntbeen there was no telling what ron would have done probably hexed him into oblivion and harry didnteven have legal magic to defend himself ginny shrugged dunno i just really wanted to kiss you is that so bad no it not bad at all but in front of your brother who will literally murder me if he catches us it definitely is he paused and sighed maybe we shouldntbe doing this like i said before no i dontwant to hear it i haventforgotten what you said back at the funeral i know that you think it too risky to be close to me said ginny but harry you re close to me now and nobody in danger i cantdo it i thought you understood that i not the one i worried about here he said if it was only me who could be hurt or put in danger i wouldntthink twice about us but i refuse to voluntarily give voldemort a reason to target you i care too much about you to let anyone do that you care about ron and hermione but you arentstopping them from being involved in this battle complained ginny why cantyou give me the same treatment because you re different gin they ve been with me from day one and i know they wonttake no for an answer no matter what harry explained they ve already been exposed they ve been targeted and everybody knows that they re with me the death eaters know who they are and that they re both threats you donthave that connection yet they have no reason to want you dead too i canthave you involved incase you haventrealized i already involved i ve been involved since my first year at hogwarts ginny argued i was down in that chamber of secrets too you know i not afraid to say voldemort name he knows me personally by now i expect i was at the department of mysteries i fought the death eaters and they all know who i am they know me they know neville and they know luna it isntyour fault she reassured but we re just as involved in this now as they are i ve faced voldemort before as tom riddle and that a lot more than i can say for my dear brother or hermione i made it out i can make it out of this too first of all harry began the chamber of secrets you re really including that in your argument you were eleven and a bloody diary possessed you you made it out yes but only because ron and i went down there to save your arse you were passed out on the floor when i found you you were hardly holding your own he tried to stay serious but he couldnthelp smiling he had expected as much from her he knew she was stubborn and that she would fight with him when she conceded to his decision about why they had to break up she was simply saving up her words for when they were alone and she could be loud without causing a scene particularly if it meant ruining dumbledore funeral and second yeah you were at the department of mysteries but not because i wanted you there i not saying you werentuseful because you really were but i still regret endangering you like that you cantbe sure the death eaters remember you from that night or more importantly that they would want you dead because of it we just cantbe together right now ginny laughed and shook her head she was angry it was obvious but she didntpull away or tell him to put her down she just stared at him her face still inches from his her legs wrapped tightly around him arguing her point i ve idolized you since i can remember i always knew somehow that i would meet you and you would fall for me she giggled i had a mad crush on you all through hogwarts but you know that of course i only went out with michael and dean because i figured you d never be interested and then you were and i finally got to date the famous harry potter the chosen one the boy who lived harry frowned why did she say it like that was that all she cared about after all they had been through only i didntwant the famous harry potter the one who survived the killing curse when he was but a baby i wanted you harry the sweet boy who spends the summer at my house and hangs out with my obnoxious brother the one who always stands up for what he believes in and tries to do the right thing no matter how distorted his image of the right thing may be she smiled softly her eyes sweeping over his features before resting on his eyes once more that all i ever wanted i wanted you not the hero who vanquished voldemort as an infant but you just couldntfigure out a way to separate those two what are you saying asked harry setting her down on her feet ginny sighed and put her hands on his shoulders forcing eye contact again voldemort has done a lot to you so many terrible things she said calmly he taken so much away from you he taken your parents and your godfather he taken your privacy your right to a normal life she narrowed her eyes at him but if you let your obsession with him screw things up between us if you let him take yet another thing away from you then you arentthe wizard i thought you were gin harry began he didntwant to get into this with her not again it was hard enough the first time when he ended things he couldntdo it again she gave him a defiant look give me one good reason she requested one reason why we cantbe together like we both want to be my parents are gone i couldntdo anything to save them harry said through gritted teeth he wasntangry at ginny he was angry with voldemort angrier than he had ever been before he knew ginny was right but he couldntlet her know that but i ll be damned if i let him take you away when there is something i can do about it he sighed you dontunderstand it much more complicated than you imagine it to be it not complicated at all protested ginny you know what your problem is harry rolled his eyes no but i sure you re about to tell me your problem she said scowling at him is that you always need to be the hero and no matter how many times we tell you that no matter how many times we insist that you arentin this alone you dontlisten you look at the world and think every little problem is yours to solve when it isn t whether it going protecting the philosopher stone or going into chamber of secrets to save my arse you always need to save someone even when they dontneed to be saved like in the triwizard tournament like at the department of mysteries like now her gestures were wild and her breathing was coming out in pants but she had tears in her eyes and a soft serene expression on her face she was clearly having a battle inside herself as to whether or not she should even be continuing this discussion you arentalone in this you donthave to carry this burden why wontyou let me help you fight harry didnteven flinch when she mentioned sirius and the department of mysteries if it were anyone else ron and hermione included he would have blown up and stormed off but for some reason it seemed okay when ginny talked about it he walked away from her his mind racing he had to tell her maybe she d finally understand finally let up and respect his decision he was scared of telling her though scared that she would react badly you want to know why he snapped spinning around to face her again she looked slightly taken aback but nodded silently the prophecy says that it can only be me it says i mthe one who has to do it i the one who can do it not you or ron or hermione me it up to me so forgive me but i dontsee the urgency in dragging you into the middle of this when it doesntconcern you in the least it does concern me i dontcare if wait you heard the prophecy i thought it smashed it did but dumbledore already knew what it said he told me at the end of fifth year harry admitted ginny raised her eyebrows basically it said that voldemort was to mark someone an equal he pointed to his forehead and that i apparently have a power that voldemort doesn t and it ll help me get rid of him it said that neither can live while the other survives ginny gaped at him with wide eyes the room was dead silent neither of them uttered a word for several minutes neither can live while the other so you have to kill him yep harry shrugged or he ll kill me ginny smiled then all the more reason for us to be with each other look harry i not going to pretend that you defeating voldemort will be a piece of cake because we both know it ll be the hardest thing you ever do but i believe in you and i believe that if there is anyone who can do it who can get rid of him once and for all it you she said back at hogwarts you said you wished we had gotten together sooner and that we hadntwasted so much time well we re wasting even more time now i want to be with you now not in a year or ten or twenty she walked over to him and took his hands in hers the way i see it we ve got nothing to lose but each other you donteven know that it ll be me who survives he told her maybe i won t maybe voldemort will live maybe if we are open about us and i die he ll come after you i wontbe there to protect you if that happens he whispered did you ever stop to think that i dontneed your protection i may not be brave like you or brilliant like hermione but i rather tough in my own way she insisted her eyes glistened with fresh tears and if that does happen which by the way i refuse to believe that it will then we ll have missed out on the opportunity to be together permanently i guess but no buts harry ginny closed her eyes and took a deep breath letting go of his hands i really really like you but you and i both know that i not a patient girl if you re asking me to wait for you to wait until all this voldemort business is over and done with i sorry but i won t she concluded it now or never and while i dontthink i could quite handle you choosing the second option i respect your right to pick it i mean maybe you no longer feel the same way you re bloody mad if you believe that i i dunno what to say obviously i feel the same about you but harry sighed can we not talk about this now how about you give me some time to see if i can come up with something and we ll talk about it at bill and fleur wedding ginny looked down at the floor and nodded i guess that okay then so proposed harry shall we get to cleaning we could ginny smiled or when ron climbed into the attic hermione behind him he found a rather strange sight before him harry and ginny were quickly moving in opposite directions both out of breath both flushed slightly wow he thought they must be working really hard to clean the attic oh hey said ginny we were just she looked around and pointed to a big old wardrobe trying to move that really asked hermione from behind him ron turned around to see her looking around wildly this place doesntlook too clean what have you been doing all this time ron and i have already finished tidying all the bedrooms you know she shot his sister an accusing look well unlike you two harry looked from hermione to ron and back again we donthave the privilege of using magic to do our work that right ginny backed him up harry wontbe of age for another week and i wonteven be sixteen until august ron sniggered that right mate almost forgot you were just a silly little sixteen year old he said and harry rolled his eyes ron one again you re as thick as ever ginny muttered oh and why is that no i wontsay let not rehash that fight said ginny ron folded his arms and stared blankly at her urging her to continue harry might be a few months younger than you she explained but he far more accomplished he played on the quidditch team since your first year she raised one finger he was triwizard champion she raised a second and he snogged more girls she finished so before you go making fun of him for only being sixteen perhaps you should consider his experience in specific areas versus yours snogged more girls has he ron said his ears turning a slight pink ginny nodded yep ron shot harry the death glare remembering the fact that he had snogged his baby sister a lot i ve snogged just as many girls as him ron boasted standing a bit taller hermione gave him a sideways glance who other than that cow lavender asked his sister ron briefly wondered how he got into that discussion before racking his brain for a name since they mostly likely werentgoing to return to hogwarts anytime soon he could say whoever name he wanted and they would never know if he was lying or not parvati he lied liar hermione exclaimed how would you know because she began i ve shared a room with her and lavender for six years now and they talk about that sort of stuff all the time never once has your name been thrown into the mix at least not by parvati she smiled smugly having effectively proven him wrong like always well except once when she asked me if we ve ever she broke off and looked away hermione just have ron a brilliant idea he looked over at ginny and harry both were putting forth tremendous effort in trying to contain their laughter and walked over to his bushy haired friend putting one hand behind her head he pulled her closer and crushed his lips against hers hermione didntseem too shocked ron assumed she had figured out his intentions when he started walking toward her and for an instant he was sure she kissed him back she recovered after a few seconds much too quickly for ron liking and pulled away slightly he was lost in her warm chocolate brown eyes he breathed in her scent strawberries and something else something he decided was purely hermione she opened her eyes and bit her lip in an act that to ron seemed like she was trying to restrain herself from kissing him again if that was truly the case he wished she would just give into temptation and lose herself in him like he was lost in her someone cleared their throat to their right startling them both smirking proudly he turned to harry who was unsuccessfully trying to hide his grin and ginny who was too shocked by her brother boldness to do anything but stare slack jawed at him what d you say gin are harry and i about even now disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter thirty the thickening first year what you re lying i swear ron eyes nearly bulged out of his head first year he asked but we were horrible to each other we ve always been horrible to each other hermione said with a small smile at any rate it wasntas if i knew how i felt in first year it just that when it started i suppose why he asked still not understanding she shrugged you saved me from that troll she said and although i sure harry had to all but drag you along when the two of you went off looking for me it was still sweet if you say so said ron so when did you finally know that you were hopelessly in love with me hermione rolled her eyes ah it nothing to be embarrassed about he teased you were just powerless to resist my charm i have an amazing sexual prowess y know did lavender tell you that oh ouch hermione smiled around third or fourth year she said i mean i d known that i felt differently about you than i did harry but you didntwant to admit it he said knowing that it was what she meant because he had experienced the same thing exactly she said she looked at him expectantly what about you what about me hermione put her hands on her hips oh come on he said i ve already given one too many romantic speeches for tonight let just go to bed ron ron grinned all right he said putting up his hands second year when you were petrified i ve never been more worried about anyone in my entire life but i didntwant to admit why i spent the next four years pretending it didntmatter that you were just my friend i suppose vicky got me a little riled up but other than that he hated talking about this sort of stuff why couldntthey just go back to snogging they d come up to his room twenty minutes ago and they d spent the last ten talking what the bloody hell was hermione playing at it wasntas though he didntenjoy talking to her because he did but he d spent the last six years talking to her what was it going to take to get somewhere did he need to actually die he flopped onto his bed his nose into his pillow my pillow smells like you he told her sounding muffled oh said hermione that because i um that is i ve been sleeping here at night ron looked up at her and grinned you ve been sleeping in my bed she nodded looking somewhat embarrassed what d you wear git hermione said wait does harry sleep here too he asked it wasntas though he didnttrust harry and hermione alone together really he trusted them with his life but he would be lying if he said the idea didntbother him in at least one way no hermione said he he sleeps in bill room there was something about the way she said it that made him think she was lying but he decided not to push her the last thing he needed was her getting hacked off at him tonight he moved over on his bed making room for hermione and she lay down beside him okay then turning onto his side he smiled cheekily and said nobody home and we re lying on my bed hermione laughed harry ginny and the twins are downstairs she said he felt like asking so bloody what what did it matter if they were downstairs what did it matter if every member of magical britain were downstairs he just wanted a nice snog from the girl he d loved since he could remember still ron knew better and so he gave in fine he said let talk some more what did i miss while i was gone have any other horcruxes been found no she said are we close to finding one she frowned i not really sure the order must be working on it you haventhad any meetings no there have been meetings i think she said harry been invited back to the order but he doesntwant to rejoin and i would probably be allowed in since i ll be eighteen soon but i haventhad any interest why not these past few weeks she said it as if i ve been up here she held out her hand above them just floating waiting for something for you i guess and for the first time since what happened at the wedding i feel like i like i back on the ground he was such a selfish prick he was so glad to be home that he hadnteven considered the toll his absence had taken on everyone else especially hermione i sorry he said she smiled you have no reason to be sorry he frowned why was she being so nice to him yeah he said i do i should ve caught on sooner i mean come on if it had been you you would ve figured everything out in a bloody day all these crazy things were happening and i knew something wasntright but did i ever question it no i just i just believed everything everyone told me i canteven believe what an idiot i was you are not an idiot none of that was your fault dontthink for a second that it was but it is not your fault you didntask for this and even if it was your fault it doesntmatter you re here now you re home i know but ron she said putting her fingers to his lips you need to shut up he tried to hold back his smile he really did but it was hard not to smile when he was with her if you keep talking like this i going to have to hit you she said and i really dontwant to do that you do remember what happened to malfoy dontyou he laughed then and it was as if some sort of spell was broken yeah i remember he said that d be pretty hard to forget she smiled widely and closed her eyes what day is it he asked the fifteenth she said actually it past midnight it the sixteenth now something clicked in his head that means it your birthday soon isntit she opened her eyes and just looked at him for a minute and he cursed in his head it probably wasnther birthday he d probably gotten it wrong and now she was going to get angry with him because he couldntremember a simple date hell the way things were going for him lately he wouldntbe surprised if the nineteenth of september was lavender birthday to his surprise not to mention relief she nodded we should we should have a big party or something he declared that would be nice hermione said but only if we celebrate ginny birthday too we well we didntget to before she spent the day in st mungo with harry ron tensed oh he said right his sister hadnteven had a proper sixteenth birthday because of him well yeah we ll celebrate both birthdays it ll be great you re sure your mum wontmind asked hermione are you kidding he said mum loves fussing over people that true said hermione so ron said after a moment what else have i missed not much to be honest what about my sister and harry how are they they re good said hermione just good are they together they re great i suppose she said slowly and um together ron made a face i dontmean that way he said yuck no i d definitely rather not know about that i dontthink i d fancy having to kill harry hermione rolled her eyes then i suppose the answer is yes they re together although i dontthink you need to worry about killing him for quite a while thank merlin for that and what about my parents how ve they been he knew that hermione probably didntfeel like being interrogated right now but he had missed so much even if it didntseem like anything to her every tiny thing that happened was something that he hadntbeen there to see and experience for himself what if he was reunited with his brothers only to discover that percy had blue hair a nose ring and a wife as good as could be expected she said and before you ask she continued quickly obviously sensing where this was headed your brothers are all alive and well and probably on their way over here as we speak so we should really get back downstairs what d you think they re doing up there asked fred knowing them said george ron probably sleeping and hermione probably reading a book alicia smacked his arm you know she said it the middle of the night i couldntbe happier that your brother is alive and i have no problem staying here for moral support but i not going to sit here if you re going to act like a giant prat that goes for us too angelina said looking at fred the twins nodded and ginny nearly laughed at how their girlfriends had them completely wrapped around their fingers she wondered if she and harry were like that and decided that perhaps it wasntsomething she wanted for them although it would come in rather handy sometimes this is just so amazing fred said seriously dropping down onto the couch i mean really am i the only one who half believes i going to wake up any second ginny shook her head no she said softly this is a lot to process but it real trust me i ve dreamt about this enough to know the difference between dream and reality they fell silent for a moment ron alive harry said he alive and upstairs ginny smiled at him and leaned her head against his chest his hand was tracing small circles on her back and she yawned her lack of sleep finally catching up to her it had to be four in the morning by now she wanted to sleep could feel herself giving into the pull of slumber but also wanted to stay awake her parents were with the rest of her brothers now probably at headquarters telling them the news about ron and they d all be back here any second loud and excited and anxious to see their brother she knew that their happiness would be contagious that she d feel re energized the moment everyone was together again but that moment was a way off and all she wanted to do now was rest she shifted slightly in harry lap and opened her eyes her brothers alicia and angelina werentthere anymore they were probably in the kitchen getting snacks that or the twins had gone upstairs to pester ron and hermione and the girls had gone after them promising hell if they didntleave the pair alone she looked up at harry who was smiling at her something about the look in his eyes tugged at her heartstrings she wasntsure how she d tricked him into loving her but she was hoping with everything she had that he wouldntcome to his senses anytime soon no she rather liked him like this what re you looking at she asked smiling just you he said you re amazing d you know that she just stared at him he was the amazing one he was the one who d acted strong and responsible when ron had come back and they hadntbeen sure what to do he was the one who d put his personal feelings aside and acted like the adult all to keep them safe out of all the traits a person could have ginny never thought she could be so turned on by responsibility and level headedness she lifted her head up and he took it as an invitation to kiss her they shifted and she ended up lying underneath him but his weight pressing down on her was warm and comforting and so she didntmind all that much oi get off and let her breathe busted ginny thought harry rolled off her and held out his hand pulling her off the couch and onto her feet they stood face to face with an amused hermione and an annoyed ron get a room ron said and then appeared to reconsider this wait no dontdo that just go in the kitchen the small smile he offered harry betrayed him harry grinned at ginny and the four of them headed toward the kitchen ginny felt someone hand clasp her wrist and turned to find ron looking at her expectantly she stood still and let harry and hermione go into the kitchen without them he different you know ron said after a moment harry that is he different around you she raised her eyebrows was this a good thing or a bad thing was ron going to yell at her for somehow breaking his best mate he is she asked yeah he said nodding he just different dunno happier i guess not so broody and harry ish ginny laughed at this well you know what i mean he said i you do know dontyou i guess she said she shrugged truthfully she couldntsay that she d noticed a change in harry shite ginny when did you grow up he asked running a hand through his hair it like i left and you were this kid and now you re you re just not you ve only been gone a month ginny said i canthave changed that much all her life she d fought to be seen as more than a child the youngest weasley and now faced with the prospect of being a young woman she was suddenly feeling desperate to hang on to a scrap of childhood for in childhood nothing but the monsters under her bed or in her diary could hurt her and if they did somehow get through there had always been someone mainly harry there to protect her or her family but ron had disappeared and nobody had been able to do anything to stop it growing up was brilliant in many ways she decided thinking of her relationship with harry but the fleeting of all innocence was something she could ve done without you did ron insisted hermione did too and harry did you see him before bloody brilliant ron looked down it hard to realize that life goes on without you y know it like none of you really needed me at all ginny stared at him for a long hard moment trying to decide if he was being serious or not and when she saw the look on his face the look of complete and utter vulnerability she did the only thing a decent sister would do she slapped him hard across the face his eyes went wide and his hand flew to his cheek ouch he said sounding scandalized i not coming to your pity party she declared you dontthink we need you merlin do you know anything wha i cried for you she said and hermione cried for you and i wouldnteven be surprised if harry cried for you we love you you stupid git not because you re good for an occasional laugh or because you re the only one who wants to be keeper when we play quidditch in the backyard harry and i couldnteven stand to go into your room because it hurt too much hermione slept in your smelly bed every night because it was the closest she could get to you it hurt every time someone said your name i ve gained three pounds because mum kept setting a spot for you at dinner every night and she d cry if we didntclear your plate hermione was bloody miserable harry was so lonely you have no idea what life was like around here without you it was terrible and you had better take damn good care of yourself because i am not going through that ever again she jabbed her finger into his chest with every word you you did the bravest thing i ve ever seen someone do when you jumped in front of me at the manor and i am forever grateful for that you re a hero ron so dontstart acting like a pathetic little bugger you are not twelve and i refuse to treat you as though you are for a moment she thought ron was going to cry his mouth was a tight line and his chin was quivering slightly then he burst out laughing and hugged her you re the best sister i could ask for he said c mon let go mum and dad ll be home soon do it again harry complied by stretching out his hand and summoning the book that hermione was holding ron jumped off his bed this is so brilliant he said staring at harry in awe do it again he done it six times already said hermione but it so cool ron exclaimed teach me to do it i i can t harry said mcgonagall says it something you just have to be able to do you cantreally learn it ron looked only slightly deterred by this well whatever he said i still going to see mcgonagall later tonight and ask if i can train with you harry was rather sure that ron who wouldntbe on the program voluntarily would soon get sick of the late nights early mornings and extreme physical and mental exertion he d probably decide that it was ridiculous and give up after a week or two but still for that week or two that ron would be training harry thought he d be having quite a bit more fun than usual think she ll let you asked ginny ron shrugged as if she going to turn down someone wanting to protect themselves well better you than me said ginny harry gets up far too early i know how much you like your sleep ron and if you start this training you wontbe getting much of it hermione yawned speaking of sleep she said let turn in what about lunch said ron as if on cue his stomach growled we haventbeen to bed yet harry said i ve got a late training session with tonks today she wontgo any easier just cause i ve been up all night with you lot he looked at ron and if you re getting up with me tomorrow you ll need all the sleep you can get fine said ron let sleep then he and hermione climbed into his bed and harry and ginny climbed into harry s harry closed his eyes and almost immediately felt himself drifting off to sleep he is back at hogwarts but it different this time he is writing something on a wall but wait that isnthis hand and those letters are too curvy to be his he steps back to admire his work the chamber of secrets has been opened enemies of the heir beware the voice in his head tells him that he has done well to go straight to bed and to tell no one of this the next morning he goes down to breakfast to find everyone talking about what happened last night it seems oddly familiar and he is scared he feels bile rising in his throat at the thought that he cannot place himself anywhere at the time of the incident her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever everything is black he opens his eyes and what he is looking at himself his mouth begins to move forming words he doesntmean to say harry oh harry why is his voice different it sounds so much like ginny suddenly without warning tom is back bad move harry potter tom says what going on he watches apparently from ginny body as the basilisk roars to life again and trains itself on the twelve year old version of himself that is standing before him he tries to move but it is as if ginny body is stuck he looks down at her tiny wrists and sees the shackles bolting her to the floor but wait that isntright where did the shackles come from harry his mouth moves but it is ginny voice that rings out in the chamber again he is struggling against the bonds that hold him trying desperately to free himself but it is no use harry no tom please take me instead harry awoke to a pain in his shin caused by ginny foot he took deep breaths and reached up to wipe the sweat off his forehead beside him ginny was still moving about in her sleep gin he said and reached a hesitant hand out toward her c mon wake up ginny eyes snapped open and she inhaled sharply she jerked out of his grasp and nearly fell out of bed in a mad attempt to put distance between them ginny it okay he said stop it me stop she swallowed thickly and covered her eyes with her hands oh harry she said i sorry bad dream i guess you re shaking i fine you are not he insisted tell me about your dream she sighed it was nothing she said it was something look at you it isntimportant she said dismissively then quickly she added i was back in the chamber same dream as always something unsettling twisted around inside his stomach at these words about what happened to you in first year he asked she nodded it was different though i mean there always more to it than what really happened you save me and then and then tom comes back and you re chained to the floor and he tries to kill me ginny glanced up at him and the look on her face confirmed his thought what how did you know i dreamt that too he said i woke up a second before you did really she asked i i dontunderstand how could we have the same nightmare dunno he said they fell silent and harry allowed the dream to run through his mind again this is insane he thought what asked ginny what he said i didntcatch what you said he looked at her for a moment i didntsay anything yeah you did i heard you gin i didntsay a thing really i promise she frowned for a second i must be hearing things she concluded great she going nutters on me ginny smacked his arm i am not going nutters what said harry oh come on dontpretend like you didntsay that one too i heard you she said you said that i going nutters on you and i not i didntsay that harry insisted but i thought it disclaimer i dontown harry potter i can go on record saying that i dontread other hp fics if this harry ginny twist is like other stories dontaccuse me of borrowing ideas from someone else which is just a nicer way of asking if i copying because i don t and dontbe so quick to assume that this story will be like whatever everyone else is writing chapter thirty one the aftermath is this even possible thought harry i didntthink it was didntthink it was what possible said ginny you just oh did you think that too harry nodded slowly i i can read your mind she asked quietly you cant read a mind he said automatically it not like a book it a many layered he stopped realizing he sounded like snape hermione shifted in the next bed and mumbled something c mon he told her grabbing her hand and pulling her out of bed let go to your room and talk about this so they canthear they were halfway to the door when ron snores stopped where re you going he asked them my room said ginny harry winced as if reading his mind although really she probably was ginny continued oh ron get over yourself it the middle of the day and more than half of our immediate family is scattered throughout the house we ll leave the door open if it makes you feel any better but we re going ron stared at them i just asked is all he said rather easily and then wrapped his arm tighter around hermione ginny rolled her eyes okay she said when they entered her room a moment later closing her bedroom door behind her she looked at him and rolled her eyes again no she said we are not doing that we need to talk about this if i really can hear your thoughts and this is how you re always thinking i going to be a right state in a few days harry felt himself blush and took a moment to ponder just how awful this strange connection with ginny could be if it really was a connection she could hear everything not just the good stuff like when he thought about how much he loved her or how beautiful she was shite this was going to get him into a whole load of trouble wasntit ginny sat down on the bed next to him think of something she said he stared at her blankly like what i dontknow anything i love ginny weasley he thought did you do it she asked he nodded i didntget anything that time brilliant the one time he thought something nice something that would at least secure him a snog later she couldnthear anything really he asked she nodded and closed her eyes in concentration come on work why canti hear him you just i heard that harry exclaimed it was it was like you were talking but you werenttalking and your voice was echoing sort of whoa that was cool the word idiot echoed in his mind in a voice that was not his own and he rolled his eyes at her i an idiot but you re with me he thought we can always change that one she teased sticking her tongue out at him wait stop it we re talking in our heads and it freaking me out we still haventfigured out why this is happening he said aloud we could go to mcgonagall i guess but i doubt she d be able to help said ginny probably the only person we could ask would be hermione harry said yeah she said maybe we should try to figure this out a bit before we go to hermione though after all we donteven know how long this ll last it might just be something that happens to witches and wizards after the y know first time her cheeks coloured slightly harry cleared his throat awkwardly yeah well dontyou think your mum would ve mentioned that to you before ginny apparently hadntconsidered this oh she said that probably true she sighed so are we going to be in each other heads all the time now i dontthink i want to know everything that crosses your mind in a day harry and i dontwant you knowing the same for me harry nodded oh this could be so bad it wasntas if he kept secrets from her still there were things that one liked to keep private he was rather sure she felt the same way he didntthink he wanted to know everything a girl thought about anyway of course it could help him out sometimes he often found himself in a situation where he had no idea what to do and ginny expected him to be able to know exactly what she wanted from him suddenly a light bulb went off in his head hey he said d you think we could block each other out by using occlumency or something it worth a try ginny said this could be useful at times but definitely not all the time i can hardly keep track of my own thoughts i dontneed yours running around up here as well he hadnteven thought about that sometimes it was so loud in a room that he couldnthear himself think could it get so loud in his head that he wouldntbe able to hear himself think ginny talked an awful lot she probably thought a whole bunch too let try it then he said now determined to learn how to turn this connection on and off he sat down on the floor and she joined him so they were sitting cross legged and facing each other erm how should we do this if we can figure this out on our own we might not need occlumency ginny closed her eyes just start thinking about things and i going to try and close you off from my mind they sat there for nearly an hour but still neither of them were able to keep the other out finally unable to ignore the noises their stomachs were making they took a break and headed to the kitchen for some lunch ron and hermione were present at the table as were the rest of ginny brothers it was an awkward thing harry soon realized to enter a room holding a girl hand and have her brothers staring at him most likely thinking very threatening possibly even murderous thoughts indeed but still there was something in the air that prevented negativity today they took their seats across from ron and hermione without a word as they ate there was a thought that bounced back and forth between harry and ginny and he couldntdecide which one of them had thought it this is how it should be they tried again after lunch harry began mentally rambling on and on various things some of which made ginny laugh while others made her blush when he was finally on the verge of exhausting every topic imaginable ginny spoke did you stop she asked hesitantly as though trying to focus on what she was doing in her head rather than what her mouth was saying no harry said she opened her eyes i i think i must ve blocked you out she said for a while there i could hear everything you said i just kept focusing on closing you off and then you were gone almost like i flicked a switch and shut you up she cursed i can hear you again it takes a lot of concentration and talking sort of makes me concentrate a little less i suppose maybe it ll get easier once we get used to it harry suggested hopefully he closed his eyes okay my turn ginny voice filled his head and he tried his best to block out the incessant thoughts of a sixteen year old girl who fancied her gossip she thought about what colin had once told her about romilda vane and how neville and luna both admitted to fancying the other but swore her to secrecy and she sincerely doubted that either one of them would ever get round to telling the other one on their own rumours and juicy little semi truths about lavender and parvati and seamus were swimming around in his mind for a short moment he actually stopped concentrated and allowed himself to be amused by some of the things she was reflecting on then she got on the subject of dean and that was territory harry did not fancy re visiting he re focused his attention on pushing her out of his head and clearing his mind and suddenly her voice was gone still it felt as though there was a small probing at the back of his head almost as if something was trying to force itself back into his mind and gain access to all its contents it worked he said almost as soon as he said it though he felt something give in his mind and ginny thoughts were once again intertwined with his own oh never mind that happened to me too said ginny maybe there isnta way to do this maybe we re just going to have to deal with this harry shook his head no we can do this he said we ll figure out a way it ll just take some practice they practiced without interruption for another few hours but still did not make much progress harry found that he was starting to figure out how to close his mind to her it was almost as though he brought up a shield or wall of some sort and it blocked her attempts to get into his head still though the invisible wall would eventually crumble granting her access the same was true for ginny and when harry did manage to keep the wall up for a decent amount of time he felt that unfamiliar sensation of something jabbing him in the back of his mind and the wall gave in under the strange sort of pressure of ginny unconsciously trying to get back into his head let both try it at the same time he suggested just wanting to see if that strange poking would stop it did and with their combined efforts they were both able to keep their individual walls up for several minutes until of course they fell again just as harry was about to suggest that they give up and try again after they d gotten some sleep there was a knock on ginny door charlie came in greeting harry with an odd look as though he couldntdecide between being uncomfortable that harry was with ginny and being glad that it was harry and not someone else harry charlie said mum sent me up here to let you know that you have training soon harry glanced at the clock and sighed he and ginny had been at this mind thing for nearly two and a half hours now he needed to go train with tonks something he was already not looking forward to as it was but it seemed especially unappealing today as he was running on virtually no sleep thanks he said he was only vaguely aware of the strange look charlie gave them as they got up off the floor he said goodbye to ginny and then left to go find ron he was rather surprised to find ron sitting in the kitchen with hermione and his mum dressed and completely ready to go mrs weasley looked uneasy about the idea of letting ron out of her sights so soon but must ve known that hogwarts was the safest place other than the burrow or headquarters for him to be about time said ron rising from his chair i talked to tonks already and she said she d let me train with you today hurry up let go harry rolled his eyes y know if you re going to be this enthusiastic i not going to let you train with us today ron grinned and clapped him on the back ah c mon this is going to be great this is bloody terrible panted ron he d never done this much running in his entire life honestly the quidditch pitch was for flying not for running laps how how arentyou tired harry was running beside him hardly breaking a sweat gotta do it no time to be tired he said and picked up the pace a bit talking is only wasting your breath called tonks pick up the pace ron there only one more lap to go ron growled but pushed forward his legs burned and his chest ached but he didntstop until harry did then he doubled over and failed in several attempts to catch his breath is it always this bad he asked you get used to it harry said he seemed to be a little out of breath at least he reached up and wiped the sweat off his forehead the running actually helps clear your head it the rest of the stuff that isntso nice ron groaned at the thought of what the rest of the stuff could be harry and tonks had been training for weeks now and had built up a rigorous workout program ron knew that this program was for harry sake not his and so he also knew that tonks wouldnttake today training down a notch just to accommodate ron good warm up said tonks coming over to them warm up ron nearly fainted at her words that had been the workout of a lifetime there couldntbe too much more could there he d expected this training business to be challenging but it was supposed to be a good sort of challenge why did he ever want to accompany harry on these stupid training sessions he wasntcut out for this he was just the sidekick the one who stood behind harry and did a whole lot of nothing he should just quit now while he had a little bit of his pride remaining i was in worse shape than you after my first run harry said and ron thought that maybe he was just trying to be nice but it made him feel better nonetheless you ll get used to all this pretty quickly you think so you better harry said with a grin we have another session with tonks tomorrow ron groaned come on said tonks we ve got plenty to do and only a small amount of time to get it all done she paused for a moment and looked at them pensively and keep your wands handy you re going to fight each other later ron and harry looked at each other in surprise their wide eyes and slack jaws quickly disappeared replaced by two identical grins brilliant said ron ginny eyes were closed and she was sitting cross legged on her bed looking as though she was concentrating very hard on something she looked up when hermione came into the bedroom did ron go with harry ginny asked yeah hermione said he was so excited about it hermione smiled at the memory ron had been incredibly excited before leaving all he d talked about while waiting for harry to come down into the kitchen was how he couldntwait to get started ginny rolled her eyes that ll probably change pretty quickly oh i sure it will hermione agreed while the idea of training with tonks an auror was something exciting for ron the work would probably be very tough harry came home rather tired every night he rose very early in the morning and mental training was no easy thing but tuesdays and wednesdays when he was with tonks were the nights he was most exhausted so ginny said leaning forward and lowering her voice what happened last night when you and ron were in his room nothing said hermione oh come on this is me i wonttell anyone said ginny i know that said hermione she could feel herself blushing but i telling the truth we mostly talked mostly ginny asked seeing that there was no way around having this sort of conversation with ginny hermione sighed and sat down on her own bed well she said slightly uncomfortably we kissed a bit i suppose ginny grinned you sure that all of course i sure hermione said her voice coming out slightly scandalized ron just got home and i still donteven know where we stand and well wouldntthat make me a bit of a slag ginny eyes narrowed a slag she cried hermione you couldntbe a slag if you tried and it doesntmatter if he just got home this sounds incredibly sappy but if you love each other that all that really matters i guess said hermione i donteven know what to do though i ve never the most i ve ever done is and ron probably did some things with lavender the only time ron was ever with lavender was in the common room said ginny i think someone would ve noticed hermione wanted to believe what her friend was saying but it was difficult especially since she distinctly remembered the night when they d first gotten together and harry had found her in an empty classroom ron and lavender had stumbled in clearly looking for a private place to do whatever the part that bothered her most wasntthat ron may have done certain things with someone other than herself although that did bother her somewhat but that ron would have done them purely out of spite and not because he had any feelings for lavender at all if ron had told the truth earlier when he spoke about his non relationship with lavender he hadnteven fancied her and wouldntthat mean he just used her unless he really had fancied lavender but wouldntthat mean he d lied straight to hermione face she hated this romance and love and boys were so difficult to wrap her head around and they were never a sure thing if she could pull out a book and look all this up she would but really even books couldnthelp her with this why wasntthere a manual on relationships she knew that ron loved her and she knew that he d tell her the truth if she asked him about lavender but that was the scary part did she want to know what if she thought she was ready to hear the truth but she really wasn t as for not having any experience with boys she knew that she could ask ginny for help and advice of course it might be more than a little awkward considering ron was ginny brother and harry was the closest thing to a brother hermione had she didntwant any unpleasant images in her mind nor did she think ginny would what if i do something wrong asked hermione she couldntbelieve she was participating in this sort of conversation let alone initiating it i mean i have no idea how to ginny laughed oh we re girls we ve got it easy she said boys are pretty simple just um well you can pretty much do anything it easy to tell if they like it or not hermione sincerely hoped that this was true because this was probably the only thing she d never read about in a book and therefore was rather clueless about the whole thing trust me continued ginny my brother will just be glad to advance past snogging it wontmatter what you do so you and harry have advanced past snogging then shut the door ginny said after a moment it about time we had some serious girl talk that was good tonks said smiling at them both but next time stop when i tell you to harry stood up and limped toward ron reckon we got a little carried away yeah said ron he winced when he moved his shoulder but grinned let s er not tell the girls about this course not harry agreed he couldnthear ginny is his head and so he figured she must ve figured out how to block him out ginny d kill me if she knew what i did to you what you did to me said harry mate i must ve thrown you at least ten feet that one time ron rolled his eyes yeah right after i knocked you on your arse for the third time in a row in your dreams all right said tonks that enough for today i ll see you both tomorrow at half past eleven right here ron be prepared to run laps again ron groaned that so early he said you complaining weasley no ron said instantly of course not half past eleven i cantwait see you then tonks nodded a goodbye and turned to walk into the castle harry rolled his eyes y know half past eleven isntthat bad try starting at six six said ron no thanks harry smiled as he and ron began to walk up to the castle several paces behind tonks er harry ron said after a moment yeah i ve been thinking said ron and well d you think that maybe we should still go to godric hollow harry found that his legs were suddenly incapable of movement ron stopped as well looking at him with a curious expression godric hollow merlin he d nearly forgotten all about that he d been so caught up with training and ginny and ron return that the thought of taking off in the middle of the night with ron and hermione leaving behind nothing but a short and rather vague letter hadntever crossed his mind d you think that smart asked harry i mean your mum would have kittens if you tried to take off now you only just got back ron looked guiltily down at his shoes i i know that he said the tips of his ears turning red but the sooner we set off the sooner we can get back it not like we re doing this on a whim the horcruxes cantbe ignored i know harry said he hesitated but but what harry sighed nothing in truth he was beginning to wonder if he would be strong enough to pick up and leave everything he knew that training was important but he also recognized that all the training in the world wouldntdo him any good if there were still horcruxes out there when he fought voldemort ron was right of course the horcruxes werentsomething that could be ignored but could he just leave everything and everyone oh hell he might as well be honest with himself he didntthink he d be able to leave ginny he thought ginny was the only one who could read his mind but apparently he was wrong you dontwant to leave my sister ron said accusingly something about the tone of his voice rubbed harry the wrong way what no said harry i mean yes i just i only well it bloody easy for you to say isntit hermione would be coming with us no problem for you he sighed fighting with ron wasntsomething he wanted to do today or any other day for that matter ginny she d put up a nice fight to keep us at the burrow but it not her decision to make i i haventcompletely lost my head of course i d leave we still need to talk to hermione though he added if we all decide that it best then then that that and your sister will hate me but that just something that i ll have to deal with i guess yeah ron shifted uncomfortably she wonthate you he said she ll just be confused and angry as all hell we wontbe able to tell her where we re going and she ll be crazy worrying about us but we ll make it back all right i sure we will harry nodded he vowed that he d become a master on blocking ginny out of his mind before the time came for him to leave with ron and hermione there was no doubt that ginny would follow him if she could even if she knew how dangerous it would be that was ginny i sure we will too said harry c mon i exhausted let get home they started back to the castle and ron laughed you ve sure got your hands full with that girl her middle name isntmolly for nothing y know she exactly like mum when she wants to be bossy and stubborn and controlling in ways you wouldntbelieve harry grinned ah she not so bad disclaimer i dontown harry potter check out my new one shots deuteragonist and stranger chapter thirty two unforgivables the next few days following ron return were rather similar to the week following his death harry was having trouble keeping track of time and events everything sort of joined and blurred together and harry was beginning to feel as if a thick mist had settled overtop of the weasley home one thing was for sure harry had never eaten food as delicious as the meals mrs weasley was cooking for them every night each was a feast to rival those at hogwarts and if harry had thought that they d received an awful lot of letters when news broke about ron passing it was nothing compared to the heaps that poured in when news broke that ron was still very much alive unlike last time they all sat down and took the time to respond to each and every letter personally all of the weasleys gravitated back to the burrow harry loved waking up late as mcgonagall had given him a few days off wandless magic training and he was able to sleep in and trudging down the stairs to the kitchen only to find all six weasley sons wrestling over a single flatcake mr weasley would be doing his best to quiet them all down i had it first you did not said bill i did boys does it really matter you re both liars i was up first i should get the last one you were up first asked charlie rubbish george i was up at least an hour before you d you really think anyone cares what time you were up asked ron i came back from the bloody dead i think i deserve that flatcake you d better not let your mother hear you talking like that percy rolled his eyes but smiled you did not come back from the dead you merely shut the hell up said ron i came back from the dead mum telling mum on me now are you good job weatherby dontcall me that really how old are you lot fred stop it thank you bill said percy no problem weatherby bill haventclued in that there a whole other stack right here harry asked ginny sitting down in the vacant seat beside her do they ever asked hermione from across the table beside ron harry grinned and reached for a flatcake morning said ginny morning said harry leaning in for a nice lingering kiss the bickering immediately stopped when harry pulled away he found ten murderous eyes and ron two scandalized ones fixated on him just as he had once written i will not tell lies he envisioned himself writing i will not snog my girlfriend while her six older brothers look on there was a long awkward moment where harry said nothing and their looks said everything suddenly mr weasley made quite the production of stabbing the flatcake with his fork got it he said triumphantly as quickly as harry and ginny caught the attention they lost it again give me that cried fred dontlisten to him dad said george give it to me the rest of the weasley boys joined in and soon harry and ginny were completely forgotten but if harry wasntmistaken he could ve sworn he saw mr weasley wink at him it just isntsmart said hermione not now i agree said harry your parents would lose it ron and ginny i can handle ginny said ron confidently dontkid yourself even i canthandle ginny hermione nodded at harry words but ron still wasntconvinced he stood bringing himself to his full height looking rather intimidating indeed look he said i thought we d agreed that we did said harry but a lot has changed since then we cantjust up and leave right now harry right said hermione besides he has other things going on now things that require him to be here everyday we all do dumbledore wants us to keep training harry piped up we can train whether we re here or not ron argued how d you figure asked harry maybe you can run laps and do all that other rubbish on your own but i cantdo my wandless magic without mcgonagall not very well at least i ron sighed all right maybe leaving now wouldntbe the smartest thing or the easiest but we ve got to do something other than what we re doing right now hermione raised an eyebrow which is nothing said ron exasperatedly we need to take action how join the order i guess ron said it about all we can do from here we re all of age and i was kicked out harry reminded him you were invited back werentyou yeah said harry okay i guess that we could do that for now why are you so anxious to leave again hermione snapped i ve been out of the game long enough ron cried this isnta game harry said i know that ron said it dangerous and mum would kill us if she knew what we re planning but isntit better to be out there risking our lives for a good cause than to be sitting round here and watching the death toll rise ron ran a hand through his hair voldemort isnttaking a break just because i ve gotten back home why should we harry rested his head in his hands for several moments ron had an excellent point but he d spoken to dumbledore on several separate occasions now and the old headmaster had remained constant on one thing train and work with the order did dumbledore know something harry didn t could he read harry mind and knew what the trio was planning or was he merely repeating it because it was logically a very critical part of defeating voldemort we said we would follow you wherever you went hermione said looking at harry we meant that ron nodded finally it seemed as though they agreed on something you re the one who has to defeat voldemort she continued but you ll need us if you re ever going to get that far of course harry said instantly i d be nothing without you two you ve both saved my arse more times than i can count you know that i need you two as much as i wish i could leave you both out of all this good luck with that ron said it crossed my mind more than once harry admitted just leaving not telling you not involving anyone other than me and voldemort not bloody likely hermione said something but it was the same moment as when ginny lowered her wall and tried to talk to him he felt that strange and foreign yet by now somewhat familiar sensation of her probing the back of his mind seeking entrance he tried his best to ignore her knowing that he d be in for it if he lowered his wall now and allowed her to know what he was discussing with ron and hermione he and ginny had been practicing and experimenting with their new connection every chance they d gotten since discovering it harry was actually very pleased with how easy it was becoming to open and close his mind to her and vice versa all this practice was also helping his occlumency skills kingsley had even commended him on his significant improvement in the last week of course he still had to work at it especially since he had to concentrate extremely hard on keeping his wall up at all times even though kingsley was poking around in his head ginny knew to never let her wall down on the afternoons harry worked with kingsley they still werentsure how this connection had come about ginny believed that it was a direct result of them making love but harry wasntso sure either way it was the only explanation either of them could think of and it limited the amount of people they could tell and consult on the situation any member of ginny family was out harry was considering asking lupin opinion but he couldntbe sure if lupin would agree to keep it between them harry and ginny both agreed that they shouldnttell the order just yet there was always hermione of course but there was a chance that the news would get back to ron and that was no good at all harry realizing that he d become lost in his own thoughts harry shook his head to clear it and looked up at his friends yeah what d you think we should do asked ron if you want to stay we ll stay and if you think we should go then we ll go hermione pushed a strand of bushy brown hair behind her ear and looked at him expectantly why was it his decision because they trust you you dolt they trust you with their bloody lives and you canttake that lightly look at what happened to ron already because of your carelessness i think we should stay harry said after a long moment for now at least until we can figure out where we ll go when we leave we cantjust go set up camp in godric hollow and expect the horcruxes to come to us they re probably scattered all over the world we can join the order and see how they go about the search said hermione then we can go on their leads exactly harry said he looked at ron that sound good ron nodded it not like i want to leave or anything but the sooner we get to it the sooner this ll all be over yeah harry nodded we ll play this by ear and see what happens and remember we canttell anyone especially ginny said ron you were right before she d lose it if she found out about this beforehand well she not above going to mum if it ll keep you from leaving harry harry sincerely hoped that they wouldntdecide to leave for some time so he could have time to come up with an appropriate way to tell ginny that he would be leaving and that no she couldntcome and no she couldntknow where he was going and no he might not be coming back something told him she wouldntbe horribly pleased a voice rang out from behind him that was unmistakably ginny s leaving the look that crossed hermione face told him all he needed to know about what he d find when he turned around ginny was likely to kill him he closed his eyes momentarily before standing up and turning to face his seething girlfriend er he said hey gin dontyou hey gin me she said severely where are you going g going harry stammered we re not going anywhere oh so it all three of you then she demanded harry exchanged looks with ron and hermione there wasnta way out of this was there why didnthe just lower his wall when she d tried to talk to him she never would ve come looking for him and she never would ve walked in on a conversation she wasntmeant to hear dontjust stand there ginny said folding her arms across her chest what d you want us to say ron asked tell me the truth she cried hermione began ginny no ginny said sounding somewhat hysterical the three of you have always left me out of things and i ve never complained once i not allowed to join the order and i not allowed to go out looking for the horcruxes with you and that fine but you are not leaving me behind now to go wherever you just you can t you cant she looked between them frantically before settling her eyes back on harry tell me i can t he said i tired of being left out just because i too young and this has nothing to do with your bloody age harry yelled it a matter of security your security sorry ginny but i like you alive you cantknow tell me right now or else or else what harry asked stubbornly or else something really bad is going to happen something so bad that i canteven think of it right now she told him lamely whatever he said quit treating me like a baby then stop acting like one harry yelled he d expected her to be upset sad afraid and perhaps even a little angry but she was just being ridiculous now and annoying ginny hadntannoyed him like this since he was twelve maybe when you quit acting like such a stupid brat and realize that you dontalways get your way we ll tell you you are such a bastard she said evenly even though she recoiled at his comment and i am not a brat yeah you are sometimes he said and when you re like that he caught himself before he said something awful what when i like that what nothing he said finally it was nothing so what you re just going to walk out on me all three of you she said harry looked at his feet well fine but dontyou dare think i ll be here when you get back harry i done with this he bit his lip hard forcing himself to not give into the look she was giving him she looked on the verge of tears and all he wanted to do was apologize and wrap his arms around her and tell her everything just so she d stop looking at him like that now looking slightly humiliated she squared her shoulders and turned to leave where are you going he asked suddenly his voice cracking she couldntleave she had to stay so they could fix what they d just said to each other where was she going i canttell you for security purposes she said childishly and then she was gone harry put a hand over his eyes what did i just do he asked to nobody in particular what you had to ron said she didntgive you a choice go find her and and talk to her said hermione harry looked up at his best friends now yeah ron urged best to get it over with if you wait it ll just give her more time to think about it and she ll just get angrier and angrier until he winced if you have to tell her the truth i cantdo that yeah you can ron urged just because she ll want to come doesntmean she gets to you were right before one day she going to have to learn to stop being such a kid maybe when she does we wonthave to treat her like one but we just agreed that we couldnttell anyone else harry said slowly i thought that was before you both started acting like utter fools hermione lectured him unless you can think of a plausible lie you need to go tell her as much as you need to let her think she involved that she allowed to come with us harry sighed he and ginny had done quite a number on themselves just now maybe if he listened to ron and hermione there was a way out of this mess okay he said but later when she finds out she isntactually coming and this all blows up in my face i want you both to remember that this wasntmy idea she deserved better than him she deserved someone who appreciated her and and trusted her someone who wouldntup and leave without a second thought oh who was she kidding she had made a complete idiot out of herself just now but how was she supposed to react to finding out that her boyfriend one of her best friends and her brother who just got back from the dead were planning on leaving and worst of all they werentplanning on telling her she never would ve seen it coming if she hadntwalked in on their conversation she had every right to be angry still even with the foggy glasses of anger through which she currently viewed the world she knew that she had no right to say some of the things she d said it was easy to see where harry was coming from if she threw out her own feelings however doing that was a lot harder than it sounded she was hysterical she couldntbe logical as well harry had drawn his line in the sand she d given him a choice tell her the truth or it was basically over and he hadntpicked her there was no mistaking that was there but she had been a bit of a brat gin she looked up from her bed and saw him standing in her doorway concern was etched in his face and he stepped in hesitantly as if she was going to whip out her wand and hex him at any moment and maybe she would if her wand wasntall the way across the room she sniffed her eyes were probably red and puffy and she hated that he was going to see her like this and know that he d won what she asked and even though the remorse was setting in she was still very incensed i i came to talk he said he took a deep breath she knew that it wasnteasy for anybody especially two people as stubborn as she and harry to apologize about before if you want me to tell you i will he was so sweet her harry always trying to be everything to everybody wanting to keep her at his side and yet wanting to distance himself from her as much as he could she loved him so much but she hated that and maybe right now she hated him just a little bit don t she said suddenly her voice hardening she could tell him that she was sorry and that she was wrong regardless of how she felt right now but that was hard it was easier to be angry she stood from her bed obviously you dontthink i deserve to know i never said that i just you know i thought that this whole reading each others minds thing would would make us closer and it turns out you ve been keeping secrets from me like you dontkeep secrets from me he had her there she kept plenty of secrets but there was only one or two that he d actually find important still none of those secrets were as serious as this one she wasntplanning on disappearing without a trace without even telling him this one is different she yelled harry stepped into the room and silenced it she wished he hadn t so everyone in the house would be able to hear their argument maybe if her mum heard it she wouldntneed to worry about harry leaving her mum would probably put him in a cage and shackle him to the iron bars only letting him out for meals and washroom breaks her problems would be solved you re leaving you wonteven tell me where you re going because it too dangerous they werentgoing to get anywhere like this she decided to change her tactics how long have you known she demanded harry looked torn almost as if he was considering lying to her that would be incredibly stupid of course because she d be able to tell she could always tell apparently though she couldn t or she would ve realized earlier that he was keeping something from her how could she have been so stupid how could she have missed it she was in his head and she couldnteven tell that something was up how long she repeated when he said nothing she asked since the wedding er he said actually since before then we were we were planning on leaving after the wedding right after and and if it hadntbeen for me getting captured she said slowly you would have was that why he d broken up with her at the wedding she felt like she was dreaming she had to be and she would wake up soon and he d be lying there beside her and everything would make sense maybe she d even laugh a little at how silly her mind could be sometimes yeah he said finally probably he took a step toward her and she backed up she was being miserable and she knew it but she couldntseem to get her brain and heart to agree on anything she would die without him but it turned out he d have no problem being away from her hell he was actually planning on getting away from her was he looking forward to it was it his idea to leave it would be easier to make sense of everything if she knew why he was leaving what he was going to do but he wasntallowed to tell her it wasntsafe she hated the tears that fell from her eyes and the sob that escaped her lips she turned away from him and a moment later she felt his arms encircle her we re joining the order again he whispered and when they get a lead on a horcrux we re going to leave and go look for it on our own and then we re coming back until they think they ve found the next one then we ll do the same thing over again and again and again until they re all gone she closed her eyes so so you re not really leaving she said slowly desperately wanting to cling to something that allowed them both to end this stupid argument she felt sure that there was more to it than this but she really didntfeel like arguing right now i guess not he said clearly picking up on what she was trying to do no no i not leaving at all if you think about it she turned around in his arms and smiled oh okay then harry fell back against the bed wow he panted mm ginny agreed he rolled onto his side and looked at her her hair was a shock of red and covering most of her face he reached out and brushed it out of the way before kissing her i have to go he said finally no yes why ron and hermione are coming to early training tomorrow and they ll probably come up to bill room in the morning to make sure i up harry explained if i not in that bed i donteven want to think about what ron would do i dontcare said ginny stubbornly i do harry said the trio footsteps echoed through the castle as they entered the great hall you re early mcgonagall said she turned around and stood straighter oh miss granger mr weasley what brings you two here so early professor harry said we ve come to talk to you about the order we want in ron said if that okay with you hermione added nudging ron in the ribs mcgonagall folded her arms across her front and peered through her spectacles at them have you discussed this with your parents miss granger she asked i well i will she said but it wontmatter will it i ll be eighteen tomorrow still mcgonagall said yes hermione said i ll talk to them about it very well said mcgonagall she smiled warmly i can think of no finer additions to the order than you three thank you professor they said we need to get to headquarters ron head whipped up when his dad words echoed through the house let stay here he whispered in hermione ear it wasntas though he hadntbeen looking forward to being included in actual order business but there were so many people in his house and the opportunity to be completely alone with her even for just ten minutes was too good to pass up no she pushed him off of her and sat up we made a commitment when we joined the order it hasnteven been a full day and already you re getting lazy ron groaned fine let go the pair got to their feet and left his bedroom on the way down the stairs they nearly bumped into harry and ginny who were coming out of ginny room why was harry in his sister room at this time of night he was about to voice his question but then he remembered that hermione had been in his room and he would be a hypocrite if he said anything to either of them there was an awkward moment where they all stood still and looked at one another you uh missed a few buttons ron told his sister and then continued down the stairs without waiting for her response what is it mr weasley harry asked when they entered the kitchen his father said nothing but merely ushered them toward the fireplace when they were all at headquarters tonks spoke we ve received a tip that there is going to be a death eater attack in brixton a muggle family parents two small children who tipped us off harry asked it not important kingsley said coming up behind them tonks will brief you while we get the portkeys ready once we re all set grab a portkey and go miss granger mcgonagall said have you spoken to your parents since we spoke this morning hermione shoulders slumped no i haven t then i am afraid you cannot accompany your friends tonight a part of ron jumped for joy at the thought of hermione staying behind safe and sound at grimmauld place but a more realistic part of him realized that they would probably need all the help they could get if they were going to take on a band of death eaters tonight professor harry said it twenty minutes to midnight hermione looked at the clock that right she said and by the time we re ready to go it ll be past midnight and i ll be eighteen mcgonagall looked back and forth between ron harry and hermione for several moments before nodding very well follow me tonks said i hate that i cantcome ginny said lacing her fingers in his hair i don t harry said honestly be careful ah but that no fun he teased she tightened her grip on his hair and he winced okay i promise i ll be careful be here when i get back she smiled always oi lovebirds fred called harry and ginny looked over at him and scowled it time to go cantsee a bloody thing ron muttered well at least it wasntonly hermione then she blinked against the darkness and tried to guide herself by listening to the sounds made by everyone around her what do we do now hermione whispered she d paid attention during the briefing but in her mind she d been imagining that the attack was in full swing it seemed that nobody was there yet we wait came tonks reply this seemed a little no very idiotic if the attack hadnthappened yet couldntthey prevent it wasntthat what the order was all about saving and helping others but said hermione we can act now and save the family that isntwhat we re here for tonks told her our job is to round up the death eaters but that isntright she protested that isntfor you to decide hermione tonks hissed quiet down and keep in position but hermione couldntquiet down not now we re just supposed to wait for the death eaters to come and attack then we go save the family yes said harry what re you going on about asked ron if the death eaters show up and see that the family had been evacuated they ll know something is up and they ll split before we get the chance to catch them it made sense of course pretty much everything made sense to hermione and if this family was a wizarding family she would sit back and let tonks and the others do whatever they thought would work this family was muggle though they were totally defenseless two small children how could ron and harry go along with this if we dontdo this right the first time lupin explained they ll get away and they ll go on to do this to even more muggle families you dontwant that do you no she said grudgingly i shh everyone immediately fell silent and looked on as several small lights appeared in the distance the death eaters had lit their wands dontmove ron hand gripped hermione left arm and harry hand gripped her right arm they were making sure she wasntgoing anywhere until they got the signal hermione closed her eyes she d known that becoming an active member of the order meant she d see some awful things but she d always figured the awful things would be done by the other team she couldntbelieve this was really going on what if these children died because nobody would listen to her and take action sooner a scream let move hermione felt ron and harry let go of her and suddenly everyone was running forward leaving her standing alone like an idiot stupefy protego expelliarmus stupefy impedimenta everyone around her was fighting and she well she couldntremember a single spell not one why was this happening to her she d never had a mental blockage like this before she was supposed to be the one who was good at thinking of her feet and yet she was standing completely still just watching as everyone else took care of business she was lucky she didntget a stunner in the chest while she stood there gaping at ron and harry her best friends since she was eleven who were both deeply engrossed in their individual battles hermione she spun around just in time to see a death eater advancing on her stupefy ron yelled the death eater fell before he could utter a curse hell hermione be more crucio ron fell to the ground and began writhing in pain hermione blood ran cold he was screaming so loud stupefy she cried she said the first spell she could think of well no the first one she thought of was avada kedavra but she couldntsay that one she d wanted to which was scary in itself but she knew she couldnt shouldn t the second death eater fell and the screaming died away ron lay there gasping for breath he grabbed the wand he d let go and then struggled to his feet are you all right she asked and it was then that she noticed the tears running down her cheeks y yeah he said dontstop fighting he turned back to where he d been before but not before giving the unconscious death eater a swift kick in the ribs next time hermione thought looking at the death eater she d stunned next time if you so much as try to hurt him you wontget off so easily the death eater went down and harry looked up just in time to see draco malfoy running by he thought of dumbledore and then of that night at malfoy manor and vowed that he wouldntlet the bastard get away this time he took off after malfoy ignoring tonks who was calling to him and ordering him to stay within sight most of the death eaters were either stunned or had apparated away already clearly malfoy was trying to flee harry wouldntlet him he used the trip jinx which he had ironically enough learned from malfoy himself malfoy was sent flying onto the grass harry dove forward and snatched malfoy wand then threw it away he turned the boy over taking his own wand he pressed the tip into malfoy throat as he leaned all his weight onto his nemesis here we are again harry said p potter malfoy not so tough without your dear old dad around are you malfoy went to speak but harry jabbed his wand harder into him the strongest sense of loathing harry had ever known washed over him he had attempted an unforgivable before on bellatrix lestrage but he hadntbeen able to do it and although he d thought that he d be able to do one that night when malfoy had cornered dumbledore he probably wouldnthave been able to go through with it but he knew now as he looked down at malfoy that he would be successful if he tried one tonight and not just that he knew he wouldntrest until he d really done it until he d given malfoy exactly what the boy deserved harry it was hermione he could tell by her voice but he refused to take his eyes off of his enemy he was so close he couldntget distracted now and give malfoy a chance to slip away this was the end of the line it had to be go away hermione why did his voice sound so strange dont just turn around and walk away b but she said and he could hear the fear in her voice he could picture the look hermione must have been giving him and he hated it but he was too involved in the moment to care he not worth it it doesntmatter harry said i need to do this he cantget away again malfoy must have realized that harry meant business because he started fighting against him trying to get away please hermione said this isntright what would ginny say he closed his eyes tightly fuck why did she have to bring up ginny harry hated hermione just then almost as much as he hated malfoy because she knew exactly how to manipulate him and she wasntafraid to do it fine harry said through gritted teeth he looked down at malfoy again i letting you go but this is the last time you get away if i ever see you again you re dead you have my word on that he punched malfoy once and then got to his feet harry hermione started but he held out his hand to quiet her just not now they walked in silence back to the house that had been under attack moments ago harry felt different now everything felt different now what if hermione hadntbeen there to stop him he knew the answer he would ve killed malfoy and and was it wrong that he was disappointed that he d been interrupted oh no death eaters were in sight but the house had been set on fire harry and hermione jogged over tonks and the others were sending spells toward the house trying to extinguish the fire but nothing was working no someone called harry looked over and saw that it was the muggle woman she was standing beside her husband and holding a small infant but hadnttonks said there were two small children my daughter is oh she in there she still in there he looked at the burning house and then back at the muggles standing on the grass watching as their house burned to the ground with their child inside and without thinking twice about it harry ran into the house not hearing hermione and ron calling after him he coughed as the smoke began to fill his lungs he squinted but couldntsee a damn thing through his glasses he ran in deeper hello he yelled and then coughed can you hear me he tried to get down low but there wasntmuch room to maneuver a beam fell from the ceiling and nearly took him out he clutched his wand in one hand as he moved hello he looked through a doorway and saw a small dirty face looking back at him the little girl gave a small squeak it okay he said come here she didntbudge please your family outside he said you ve got to come with me it not safe in here there was no way of getting her out he d have to stun her and he didntwant to do that he coughed and nearly doubled over he could hardly breathe in there it was getting too smoky and he d have to leave soon whether she was with him or not he reached for her take my hand he yelled i wonthurt you her eyes flickered from his face to his outstretched hand and then back finally she looked at his wand and started to cry he cursed and pocketed his wand please he said just just take my hand she reached out hesitantly and grabbed harry hand he pulled her to him and looked around the beam that had fallen was blocking the doorway he couldntgo back the way he came he stood there helplessly for a moment before realizing that he could apparate he squeezed his eyes shut and held his breath the cool air hit him and he found himself on the grass outside the house the little girl was still in his arms he released her and then surveyed her for damage her face was dirty from the smoke and her pigtails were half out she had bright red hair and a cute button nose and he immediately thought of ginny she began to cry harder when he let her go and so he picked her up again and carried her over to her mother who snatched her out of his arms and gave him a half grateful half frightened look before turning back to her husband all the while sobbing incoherently disclaimer i dontown harry potter harry let malfoy go instead of trying to get him put into azkaban because azkaban is incredibly worthless at this point the dementors arentworking with the ministry anymore and draco would probably be out in no time especially if lucius had anything to do with it i dontknow about jkr 7th book version harry potter but my post hbp harry wouldntbe happy doing malfoy in unless he did it himself maybe you think the canon harry is going to be more gentlemanly about it and maybe you re right but mine is going to be taking names chapter thirty three the party what part of be careful do you not understand i said i was sorry sorry you ran into a house when it was on fire how daft could he be was he trying to get himself killed and just where were ron and hermione during all of this they were supposed to watch him and make sure he didntdo something so harry harry winced and dropped his head forward onto his arm can we do this later i kind of busy right now ginny looked at him fiercely for a moment before nodding and sitting down harry was sitting backward on a chair in one of the bedrooms in grimmauld place and audrey was rubbing something over his burns bugger he yelled she jumped up off the bed and knelt beside him she frowned at him but rubbed the side of his face soothingly that stings that means it working said audrey keep still make you think twice about running into a burning house next time huh his voice echoed in her head what did you want me to do just watch it burn you cantbe the hero all the time harry you need to learn that drink this audrey said completely oblivious to the way harry and ginny were communicating she handed him a potion and he made a face after gulping it down is there anything i can do she asked you can stop lecturing me for a second he told her smirking i know i dontmean to act like such a cow it just scary i have to stay here and sit on my hands while you re out there doing who knows what and to keep from going crazy i tell myself that you ll come back okay and then you show up like this what am i supposed to think he frowned you worry too much you dontworry enough then i guess we re perfect for each other then she smiled grudgingly and stood up the door opened suddenly and a small girl with red hair poked her head in and smiled muuummmm she yelled a moment later a woman entered the room behind the little girl her eyes darted around once before landing on harry excuse me she said is this a bad time no audrey said she put a large bandage over harry back and handed him a shirt all done that should be good as new in a few hours she looked at the small girl then up at the woman how is she good the woman said the other doctor erm healer checked her out audrey smiled and then left feeling out of place ginny made to leave as well but harry stopped her and told her she could stay oh my said the woman taking a few hesitant steps toward harry are you all right oh yeah it nothing harry said casually he shrugged and then winced ginny scowled it not nothing you git ginny muttered this is ginny he said ignoring her dontmind her she a little hacked off at me right now the little girl tugged harry glasses off of his face and put them on hers harry laughed and then squinted up at the woman again i i just wanted to come and thank you she said what was this all about ginny must ve made a noise because the woman turned and looked at her he told you hasnthe she asked um actually ginny said glancing at harry he hasntsaid a thing what she going on about it not important gin he saved my daughter life he did what our house was on fire and she was inside he went in after her if it hadntbeen for him ginny gasped oh she was such a horrible person she d given him an earful about his injuries and he d only done it to save that precious little girl oh harry i so sorry i awful no you re not why didntyou tell me you just let me stand here and yell at you i dontknow it not that important you dontthink it important that you ran into a burning house to save a little girl who you donteven know and will probably never see again well i guess it is a little anyway the woman continued the the man downstairs said he was going to e erase our memories i wanted the chance to thank you first ron found hermione sitting on the floor in the living room of grimmauld place and leaning up against the wall she wore a sort of far away expression on her face happy birthday ron said i mean i sure it hasntbeen that great yet or anything but the party tomorrow should be fun hermione nodded it ll be nice she agreed ron frowned and sat down on the floor beside her i know i not normally good at emotions and all that rubbish but even i can tell that something wrong she shrugged do you ever get the feeling that we re not all going to make it out of this what what makes you think that remember before when i told you i thought that we would all be together forever i was fooling myself i wanted so badly to believe that i was right she said but we have to think logically harry almost died tonight and not because the death eaters almost got him but because he just too much of a hero for his own good yeah but that just harry ron said after a moment he always been like that and he always just escaped death because someone has always been there to keep him in line but he soon he going to be in charge dontyou think and what then she asked we we should have been there to stop him from running in there we should have been watching out for him we need to be his friends we need to take care of him he isntfour ron said he doesntneed us trying to be his babysitters he does she argued as long as he acting recklessly he needs us to be there to hold him back and not let him run ahead without thinking things through hermione he said pleadingly he just wanted to change the subject he didntwant to sit here and talk about whether or not harry number was almost up how morbid was that harry not the only one who almost died in the past you got hurt pretty badly at the department of mysteries and you weren t er acting recklessly were you no she said if i had been reckless though i almost positive that i would have died i ron began but audrey came down the stairs then and he forgot was he was going to say how harry he ll be fine audrey said nasty burns though good thing he didntwait to have them looked at earl the other healer called audrey name and she excused herself that a relief hermione said but do you see what i mean harry didnteven want to have audrey examine him he only did it to get ginny off of him he just doesnt think sometimes i know ron admitted some of what she said made sense and he knew she was somewhat right he also knew that she was only saying these depressing things because she wanted harry and everyone else to come out of this alive but they had conflicting methods when it came to dealing with problems ron avoided the situation while hermione liked to face it head on really though he continued what are we going to do telling harry to be more careful will only get him hacked off at us we have to take it upon ourselves she said i cantstand by and let something awful happen not again harry and ginny appeared at the base of the stairs and hermione fell silent what re you two talking about ginny asked the party tomorrow ron supplied surprising even himself with his quick thinking i said i bet fred and george get drunk first and i said they had better not hermione added because my parents will be there i sure they ll behave ginny said she appeared to consider what she d just said er i sure they ll try if you ask them to maybe harry made a face and then lightly tugged on the ends of ginny hair c mon i knackered let go home ginny are you still awake yeah i cantsleep without you same cantyou come down here for a bit not without getting caught all right so are you going to tell me what bothering you or am i going to have to guess what there nothing bothering me yes there is i can tell i canttell you you can tell me anything not this harry okay fine but tomorrow when you cantlook at me dontsay i didnttry to spare you whatever it is it cantbe as horrible as all that i almost killed someone tonight what who at the raid we were all fighting and i saw malfoy i couldntlet him get away i dontknow what came over me and if hermione hadntstopped me i would ve done it i would ve killed him oh harry you hate me i love you i have no idea why you would because you re sweet and kind and because you drive me absolutely crazy er in a good way that is because you make me laugh because you spent most of this school year staring at me and looking away really quickly when i glanced over at you and then you turned around and snogged me in front of my brother my ex boyfriend and about fifty others because you re totally oblivious to how great you are which makes you even greater because i fell for you when i was ten years old and i built you up so much in my head and it turns out you re nothing like what i d always hoped you re even better and it doesnthurt that you re completely adorable not to mention an amazing kisser there was a soft pop as harry apparated into her room you you thought of all that just now he asked sheepishly she nodded yes she said and i can keep going if you d like no he said he sat down on the edge of her bed and half smiled i trying to brood and you arentmaking it easy on me she hit him over the head with her pillow and smiled at him but sobered immediately we do you think we should talk about what you said before harry eyes dropped to the blanket on her bed i guess he said he pulled out his wand and cast a silencing charm she leaned forward and reached for his hands look i not going to pretend that the thought of you you know is something i like but it necessary i guess hell even i ll have to do it at some point no harry said stubbornly you won t i ll never let the death eaters get that close to you eventually she said with a sigh you re going to turn your back for a second and they ll be ready harry they ve tried it before they ll try it again there nothing we can go about it if they did try something harry said i would be the one to i mean you shouldnthave to he shook his head even if you did it would be different it would be self defense malfoy was different he was running away gin and i followed after him i threw him to the ground and i wanted to do it a part of me still wishes i had how sick is that ginny closed her eyes for a moment but she had to open them again all she could see in her mind eye was harry pining malfoy to the ground and muttering that awful curse it seemed like something a monster would do but that wasntthe case she wouldntblame harry if his emotions had gotten the best of him and he had done it in fact she was fairly certain her dad and charlie and maybe even bill had done it in the past none of them were monsters it not sick she insisted she wished he d look at her she needed him to see the sincerity in her eyes there a war going on and everyone has to pick a side or die malfoy picked the wrong side he deserves whatever he gets the night that dumbledore died i promised myself that i d get my revenge on them all especially malfoy but the more i thought it over the more i started to think that maybe malfoy wasntas evil as he wanted everyone to think i mean myrtle said he would cry in the toilets and i even caught him that one time but then at malfoy manor i saw how cocky he was how awful he was and he made it look like he d been torturing you just to mess with me he twisted the blankets in his fist he wasnteven allowed near where i was being held ginny said at least that was what snape had told her yeah harry said i knew it wasnttrue but the thought of him doing that to you i not ever going to let it happen not again i swear on on everything if something happens to me she began but he put his hand to her lips nothing is going to happen but if it does ginny i just saying well dont just say he said fiercely nothing is going to happen to you because it just cant dontyou get it if you if they took you from me that would be it i i wouldnteven fight anymore because there would be no bloody point and they d kill everyone else in the entire fucking world but if you were already gone the others wouldntmatter to me at all i d have no reason to even get out of bed in the morning let alone win a war and it selfish and stupid and a whole bunch of other terrible things but it the truth i doing all this so the world can be safe for you and i dontknow our kids she smiled slightly you think about that sort of stuff she asked harry shrugged i guess if you live your life knowing you might not have a future it makes you wonder what sort of future you arentgoing to get to have you re going to get a future she insisted with me if you want it i mean yeah harry said nodding almost imperceptibly i think i could handle that and if you ever need to talk about this i here she said i always going to be here no matter what harry drew in a breath everyone on that side is fighting dirty they d kill us all without even blinking if i could just do that back to them we d stand a chance and i know i only as good as they are if i sink to their level but if that what i have to do in order to get the job done i ll do it i d do anything to just get this all over with ginny rested her head against his shoulder and breathed in his scent i know you would she said that what scares me they re really kind of sickening arentthey ron asked hermione looked up from her book and followed his eyes to ginny and harry who were staring at each other and not speaking i dontknow said hermione i think they re sweet sweet he repeated tell me if you think this is sweet he opened his eyes wide and stared at her she stared back for a few seconds before laughing uncomfortably and realizing how ridiculous they must ve looked you re right she said i dontknow how they do it ron looked back at harry and ginny oi d you have to be so annoying they jumped slightly and turned to look at ron we re not even doing anything ginny said we re just sitting here no we re just sitting here you two are being weird ginny rolled her eyes and stood i going to get something to eat and then maybe help mum set up what time is everyone coming at dunno said ron i ll come with you harry said he gestured rudely when ron coughing fit began sounding distinctly like whipped and then he got up and followed ginny out of the room hermione rolled her eyes at the two of them she went back to her book desperate to get her mind off of the upcoming party her parents would be there and she wasntsure how she would react to it she wasntsure how they d react to it she hoped they didntget into another awful fight they hadntspoken since before ron funeral when ron had proposed throwing hermione a birthday party mrs weasley had suggested inviting hermione parents she hadnteven been sure if they d come but ron was so insistent she didntwant to tell him that she d gone completely off the deep end last time she d seen them yes now that she thought back on it she was willing to admit she d been a little less that lovely to them so she d smiled and gone along with it presently they were going to arrive any minute and although she spent most of her wizarding life telling ron to be mature and be the bigger person whenever he had a confrontation with malfoy she was finding out that it was easier to dispense advice than it was to take it after a moment of being lost in her own thoughts and concerns she realized that ron had shifted on the couch and was now sitting significantly closer than he d previously been she looked up from her book again and smiled questioningly at him what wrong she asked oh nothing he said i just realized that i hadntgiven you your birthday kiss yet birthday kiss she asked with a small smile yeah haventyou ever heard of it no she said playing along cantsay i have care to demonstrate sure i mean i d hate for you to not be properly informed on something he told her she was saved from replying when he leaned forward and pressed his lips to hers they separated after several long moments actually hermione said i think i have heard of that but if you really think about it we ve known each other since we were eleven i ve missed out on six other birthday kisses and you ve missed out on six as well ron laughed i guess we ll have to do something about that then they never fully reimbursed one another though because george came in a few minutes later and interrupted them your parents just got here he said and they ve got some packages for you muggle things you might want to get down there before dad self control snaps and he opens them himself clutching her husband hand mrs granger knocked on the door to the weasleys house the er burrow and when she received no answer she walked in she looked around nervously it wasntas though she thought the weasleys were strange the fact that they were wizards aside they were actually rather charming people though their language was slightly off colour and it wasntas though she thought molly and arthur were unfit parents still though there were certain things that a mother didntfancy having another woman do for her own daughter it was easier to resent the weasleys for stealing her daughter than it was to hate her daughter for choosing a family other than their own she knew that she was being irrational but she didntcare when it came to hermione all she had ever hoped for was that her baby was happy and healthy and taken care of but she d always just assumed that she would be the one making sure all of those things were happening molly weasley smiled widely and embraced her and as she looked into the face of the woman who had replaced her she had to bite her cheek to keep from crying there was a sound of shrieking laughter just outside of the kitchen and thinking that it was hermione her heart leapt and broke at the same time it turned out that it was only hermione friend harry and the redhead girl ginny harry had thrown ginny over his shoulder and she was laughing and yelling for him to put her down harry spotted mrs granger and placed ginny back on the floor the pair sobering immediately er hi mrs granger mr granger he said hello said mrs granger warmly she had always liked this boy i ll go get hermione she just upstairs he said s okay i ll go one of the twins really they looked so similar that she wasnteven all that concerned that she couldntdistinguish between the two volunteered i apologize for the way the house looks said mrs weasley we ve been so busy trying to set up that everything is sort of well everywhere no mrs granger said it fine in truth she thought that the burrow was actually very quaint it was smaller than her own house and with seven children of their own as well as hermione and harry she didntunderstand how they all fit but somehow molly and arthur managed to keep the house from caving in on top of them though she suspected it involved at least a little bit of magic is there anything we can do to help mr granger asked no no mrs weasley insisted you re guests sit down and relax i ll take those ginny said and then relieved mr granger of the packages he held oh this one heavy probably a couple books yeah hermione will love it she been itching for something new to read harry moved to help her carry them into another room mrs granger smiled at the young girl before her she d only officially met ginny weasley twice and both times the girl had been slightly less than cheerful the first time had been the day the kids had been released from school when the grangers had joined the weasleys for dinner in the backyard ginny had frowned through her entire meal and gone up to bed instead of playing that kwiddich thing with her family the second time her somber mood had been completely understandable she had just been rescued from wherever it was that she d been held and her brother ron had been killed ginny hadntbeen the only one who had been hurting then though hermione had been absolutely devastated mrs granger couldntstand watching her daughter be in so much pain she had only wanted to bring hermione home and take care of her the way she used to but it was mrs weasley who had taken care of her and that was too unsettling at first she had believed that this whole witch thing was an april fools prank of some sort and when it turned out that it was real she had allowed her daughter to go off to a strange school that was thousands of miles away without any means of contacting her short of an owl her one concern would be that hermione would turn her back on their world and way of doing things using magic was surely easier than doing things the manual way hermione had been far more advanced than the other children her age and it was no question that she would excel at whatever task she faced at hogwarts mrs granger hadntminded when hermione went to stay with the weasleys at first she was pleased mostly that her daughter had made friends soon though she began to miss having hermione in the house still she d let her daughter go it was selfish of her to force hermione to stay with them when she clearly wanted to be at the burrow but could she be blamed for wanting to spend even a little time with hermione she d been almost completely shut out this past year her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs ron entered the kitchen and smiled in greeting it was a strange thing to see someone who she had thought to be dead was up and walking around as though nothing had ever happened when she had received the owl saying that ron was very much alive and well she hadntbelieved it but had known better than to think hermione had sent the letter as a joke his hand was clasped tightly in hermione s and it almost looked as though he was pulling her into the room against her will she knew it was a mistake coming here she locked eyes with hermione who much to her surprise smiled mum dad said hermione hi this was by far the most awkward moment she d ever shared with her daughter including the time they d spoken about the birds and the bees happy birthday said mrs granger hesitantly happy birthday her husband said and she nearly forgot that he was even standing beside her she d released his hand ages ago thanks hermione said she held out her arms awkwardly and hermione stepped into them i ve missed you she admitted to her daughter i ve missed you too hermione sniffed i sorry about everything but you sort of just showed up and ron was and and i couldntgo home it was selfish of us of me to expect you to come home after everything that had happened her mother said they separated after a moment hermione greeted her father as mrs granger wrapped her arms around ron and kissed his cheek i um hello mrs granger ron said awkwardly i very glad that you re okay she said sincerely suddenly a thought occurred to her and if i may ask what exactly happened ron looked at hermione who hesitated for a second before sighing and gesturing toward the kitchen table maybe you two should sit down hermione said we still have a little time before the rest of the guests arrive are you going to tell us what going on around here mr granger asked yes hermione said looking at her feet we ll tell you everything are you okay mrs granger harry asked the four teens had taken their turns talking explaining everything they could to hermione parents without saying too much and jeopardizing their security the guests had arrived just as they were wrapping up and the party was now in full swing harry she said her eyes still wide i just well oh i need a drink harry tried not to smile as mrs granger grabbed a firewhisky after entertaining a friendly and harry was relieved to note a non voldemort related conversation with mcgonagall and lupin for quite some time ginny came over and he excused himself well harry said sitting down beside her on the couch what d you want for your birthday ginny shrugged i ve already got everything i need she said i didntask you what you needed he said leaning in a little closer to her i asked what you wanted she smirked you she said me you ve already got me c mon he said be serious i ll get you anything you want it doesntmatter to me what it is just tell me you she told him let go to my room he looked around suddenly very aware that over half the people in the house were direct relatives of ginny s and the other half were nearly all members of the order he knew that his face probably held a very scandalized look but he couldnthelp it you your entire family is here look around they re all completely pissed they wouldntnotice us if we caught fire and started doing flips around the bloody room come on but gin fine never mind forget i offered forget no no that wasntwhat he wanted to do at all he was merely going to suggest that they do it discreetly leave one at a time even no i never said that i oh i think that what you said she leaned forward slightly giving him a rather lovely view down the front of her dress harry rolled his eyes gin ny he said aloud getting dangerously close to begging i didntsay that exactly i was merely um weighing the pros and cons and i ve decided that the pros greatly outweigh the cons all right ginny sighed you win let go he was well aware that she d twisted the conversation around but he certainly wasntabout to argue with her they stood up and were making their way through the crowd of people when they heard hey ginny ginny cursed and harry turned to see fred coming toward them have a drink he said and thrust a bottle of firewhisky into both her and harry hands he stood there watching as if to make sure they would accept them um thanks said ginny well well what drink shouted fred and the rest of the weasley sons cheered and thrust their glasses into the air it a party sighing they both tossed their heads back and took a long drink it burned on the way down it wasntcalled firewhisky for nothing of course but after harry sixth or seventh sip it wasntas bad ron came up behind them and started talking effectively blocking their exit route to the stairs damn there was no escaping now if ron figured out what they were trying to do well that wouldntbe good where hermione asked ginny ron gestured to the corner where hermione was chatting with kinglsey honestly we re at a party and all she wants to do is talk about smart things harry grinned and took a nice sip of his drink he and ginny somehow ended up surrounded by five of her brothers something that made harry uneasy they all looked at him as if they knew exactly what was on his mind and there was no way for him to get it off his mind now remember the last time we drank ginny whispered in his ear oh yes he would have to be awfully plastered not to remember that shite ginny was such a tease they mingled with the rest of the guests and fred who apparently had designated himself bartender never left them without a drink in their hands by the time the party was starting to thin out and it looked as if they might actually get away both harry and ginny were rather drunk this isntgonna happen he told her cantdo the charm cantdo anything she grinned and rubbed against him when she weaved out of the crowd to go over to hermione and he thought fleetingly that she d never intended on acting on her words but merely wanted to see how worked up she could get him tonight minx he muttered huh said ron psst hermione hermione looked up when ginny called and ginny gestured toward the kitchen she could feel herself wobbling slightly on her feet as she walked c mere hermione excused herself from her conversation and met ginny in the deserted kitchen what is it she asked can you do the contraceptive charm ginny whispered why she rolled her eyes at hermione question she looked around wildly making sure none of her brothers were listening it would be disaster if they were harry and i she whispered loudly are a little drunk so can you i d really appreesh appreesh appreciate it i donteven know how hermione said sorry s okay ginny said dejectedly she felt a hand around her wrist and turned to see harry standing behind her upstairs no charm so we just wont i mean we can still he was blushing and it made her laugh okay she agreed harry tugged on her sleeve and started to pull her over to the stairs g night hermione he called what ll i do if anyone starts looking for you she asked you re smart think of something they left hermione and eventually made it up to ginny room standing in the doorway he unzipped her dress as she pulled his shirt over his head when ginny turned to pull harry into her room she nearly screamed oh she gasped and her hand flew up to her mouth tonks buttoned her shirt and lupin flushed we were just snogging harry supplied yeah ginny cried in my room they both muttered apologizes and left as tonks passed by ginny grabbed her arm and halted her do one thing for me she said and nobody has to know about this tonks raised an eyebrow you would tell it might slip out ginny said vaguely tonks sighed what do you need contraceptive charm your mum would kill me have it your way then tonks sighed and pulled out her wand i am in desperate need of a subplot for ron and hermione to be quite honest i really only interested in this pairing when they re not together or when they re bickering and i not going to break them up or constantly have them arguing unless i come up with something i like or i get a good suggestion i going to keep this story predominately h g with r hr just on the side but of course any suggestions will be greatly appreciated and if used credit will be given where credit is due disclaimer i dontown harry potter this chapter is a transition chapter which is why it shorter than usual expect the next chapter to be better hopefully thanks for the suggestions everyone i really liked a lot of them chapter thirty four the next hurdle harry head hurt judging by the noise ginny made beside him her head was also hurting hangover potion she muttered into his neck did you make one he asked no she whined but i really need one harry forced his eyes open and winced against the light that shone through the curtain he rolled over and nearly fell out of bed when his eyes landed on ginny clock oh not so loud harry i dying here ginny the clock it too early to get up it nearly breakfast ginny shot up her hand immediately flew to her forehead ouch she said then she looked at him with wide eyes dontjust stand there get dressed and apparate up to the twins room before someone comes looking for you the twins probably spent the night here harry reasoned i think all of your brothers did actually the only thing i can do is go up to ron room maybe he still sleeping and wontsee me sneak in or maybe he passed out on the couch last night and hasnteven been up to his room yet hurry up then and if mum tries to come up here and wake me up dontlet her harry forced himself out of bed and pulled on his clothes okay bye each step was murder as harry climbed the stairs up to ron room he felt as though he was walking toward his doom and maybe in some sense he was he said a silent prayer that ron had stumbled into his bedroom late last night and hadntnoticed the empty bed beside him he passed hermione who was coming out of ron room she handed him a glass hangover potion she said softly i was just coming to find you he gulped it down gratefully and although the taste was rather awful he felt his head immediately begin to clear thanks he said she looked at him expectantly for a moment i m uh going up to ron room harry said tentatively he isnt he isntawake is he hermione bit her lip shite harry said d you think he ll believe that i passed out in the loo after spending the night throwing up cantget mad at a bloke who was up sick half the night can you actually hermione said ron got up quite some time ago he already been to the loo and he ll know you re lying oh harry would you like me to come up with you no harry said he knew ron would be furious with him but he also knew that ron would think harry was a complete coward if he dragged hermione up there as his shield it ll be okay you can go down to breakfast oh and try not to wake ginny just leave the potion beside her bed yeah hermione nodded giving him one final look of concern she turned and began walking downstairs harry paused before going into ron room what was he going to say ron was going to kill him it wasntas if he could pretend nothing had happened with him and ginny when he thought back on it he couldntbelieve how stupid they d been they d just disappeared together ginny brothers might ve been drunk but surely at least one of them hadntbeen completely incoherent and what about ginny parents how was he going to face them at breakfast this was a disaster taking a deep breath harry pushed ron door open and went inside er good morning he said ron fixed him with a nasty glare before pushing past him and going out the door this so wasntgood ron avoided harry gaze all morning and only spoke to him when he asked harry to pass the pumpkin juice harry didntmind very much if ron wanted to act immature that was his prerogative ginny tried several times to speak to him and each time ron acted like a complete arsehole to her needless to say ron wasntthe only one who was angry at the moment thankfully the other weasleys didntknow why ron and harry werentspeaking during breakfast mrs weasley had inquired about why they were so quiet but both boys had shrugged and muttered something about being tired before going back to their meals it was to be a full moon that night so when harry and ron went to hogwarts for training they practiced with tonks instead of lupin we re going to do some more physical training today tonks said when she came in i hope the party wasnttoo much for you last night because we have quite a bit to cover today they started by running laps around the quidditch pitch as always ron and harry ran in silence and harry was grateful for it because it gave him time to think of how he was going to make things right again he and ron had had their share of arguments in the past they d sometimes gone days even weeks without speaking but they had been kids then they were adults now and they should ve been able to deal with their hostile feelings far better than they currently were however harry knew that pointing this out to ron would most likely earn him a punch in the face so he said nothing still harry had to wonder what would happen when he ron and hermione left and went searching for horcruxes if he and ron got into an argument over something would the entire mission be jeopardized because neither could get over it and keep focused and what about hermione would she get caught in the middle like harry always did when she and ron feuded she would obviously side with ron now where would that leave harry he hated thinking about things like this about worrying himself over fights with ron it made him feel like a girl but he couldnthelp it not when it came to ron or hermione they d always been there since day one and what if they both decided they didntwant to be there any longer what if they went off together and left harry alone he would have ginny of course but she was different sometimes harry just needed to talk to a bloke his girlfriend had red hair and freckles but she wasntanything like ron let do that thing ron said and for a moment harry thought ron was speaking directly to him rather than to tonks y know the thing where harry and i fight he pulled out his wand before tonks had even agreed and faced harry tonks must ve noticed something was up between the two friends because she looked at harry questioningly do you want to harry she asked if he said no ron would hate him if he said yes ron would still hate him but at least ron would get out his aggression and harry would be able to look at his best mate without receiving dirty looks in return er harry said fine harry pulled out his wand and hoped for the best so tell me ron said audrey had just been over to examine and treat both ron and harry and now they were lying on their backs staring up at the sky with orders not to move until tonks returned did you have fun with my sister last night he was too sore and far too tired to speak with as much malice as he d like i dontknow harry said sounding just as weary as ron felt did you have fun with mine you donteven have a sister ron said hermione my sister harry said simply in a way harry was right but in another way he couldnthave been more wrong harry hadntwatched hermione grow up the way ron had with ginny harry hadnttaken baths with hermione when they were little and he d never put a bandage on her knee after she d fallen she d never snuck into his room in the middle of the night crying because she d had another dream about tom riddle and he was the only one she felt could protect her and although harry would jump in front of hermione in a second if he thought something bad was going to happen to her it was different than it was when ron jumped in front of ginny not by blood ron said since when do you care about blood harry challenged and ron knew he was right blood didntmake a family harry was as much his brother as bill charlie percy and the twins were if he absolutely had to pick someone to be with ginny it would be harry but it was a lot easier to feel good about his sister relationship with his best mate when it wasntbeing flaunted in front of him and it was even easier when he didntknow exactly what that relationship entailed merlin what if harry died he didntnormally let himself think about things like that but it was a possibility and what would happen to ginny if harry was gone ron wouldntbe able to pick up the pieces not this time he wanted his sister to be happy she deserved it she deserved to feel the same way as ron did when he was with hermione but what if she could only ever feel that way with harry after all ron was certain he could only feel that way with hermione if you hurt her i ll cut it off ron threatened changing tactics harry shifted slightly beside him and then said if i hurt her i ll cut it off myself ron couldntstifle the small laugh that escaped his lips he rolled onto his good side to regard harry you re a real git you know that harry said lightly you shagged my sister and now you re calling me names pretty much harry concluded and you re only hacked off with me and ginny because hermione still wontlet you shag her ron felt his ears begin to turn red hermione spent the next day with her parents the weasleys were called to hogwarts but she stayed at the burrow to see her parents off we want you to come home mrs granger said as they stood at the door and prepared to leave but we know that you dontwant to and we have to respect that the second you want to come home though mr granger piped up donthesitate to contact us we ll be here to pick you up as soon as we can i appreciate that hermione said i really do but i going to stick this out until the end what if you get hurt hermione wrung her hands i willing to take that chance she said sincerely i dontcare what i have to do i going to help harry and the others win this fight why is it your responsibility mrs granger asked why is it suddenly your fight it always been my fight hermione told them i have been involved since the day i went to hogwarts just because i ve never really given you all the details doesntmean i haventbeen in this sort of situation before hermione parents frowned i know that there a chance i could get seriously injured she continued i may even die but i think my life is a small price to pay if our side can win this war dontsay that mrs granger cried it the truth she said whether you agree or not harry parents are dead and so is his godfather and so are a ton of others that he loved he lost so much but he still going and as long as he fighting so am i i cantlet him go alone i won t ron can go with him mr granger said you dontneed to i want to she said especially if ron is going why couldnther parents seem to understand what she was saying was she not articulate enough how could she make them realize that this whole thing was more important to the survival of both wizards and muggles than her parents realized and acknowledged i doing this for you too she said if voldemort wins this war the first thing he does will be to come after people like you who donthave magic by being so active in this war i ve already put a target on both of your backs now it my job to defend you hermione all i asking she said softly is for you to understand why i not coming home with you today mrs granger and mr granger looked at each other and then at their daughter nodding mrs granger said we we understand harry was running laps when he looked up and noticed mcgonagall standing by the pitch he slowed to a jog and then stopped altogether when he was sure she was there to talk to him professor he asked noticing her expression what is it come with me mcgonagall said weasley too harry signaled ron and they followed mcgonagall into hogwarts as they made their way up to dumbledore old office they kept throwing questioning glances toward one another but neither had the guts to ask mcgonagall about what was going on it didntappear as though she would give them any clues anyway the rest of the weasleys were waiting in the office when harry and ron arrived ginny gave him a nervous look he stood unmoving for a moment before ron spoke a strange sense of panic in his voice where hermione harry felt a sickening sense of dread pooling in his stomach hermione no not hermione nothing could ve happened to her she was supposed to be at the burrow she was supposed to be safe as long as she was there the death eaters couldnttouch her could they suddenly the world felt like it was caving in on top of him hogwarts had been attacked so had the burrow at the wedding was grimmauld place next was there no safety left in the world at all anymore where was hermione wherever she was she had to be okay and they would get her back because they just had to it was hermione she was his sister in every sense of the word but thank merlin it had been hermione and not ginny yes ginny was still okay and it was an awful thing harry was doing feeling relieved that hermione had been taken instead of ginny but really wouldntron do the same thing if the roles were reversed it didntmean harry wanted hermione to be hurt just as ron wouldnt want ginny to be hurt but ultimately if it came down to a decision of who to rescue between his two friends and his girlfriend harry would choose ginny and ron would choose hermione that was just the way it was now she fine ginny said quickly she spending time with her parents mrs weasley said before they leave harry sighed in relief but if hermione wasntpresent the information they were about to hear couldntbe all that important could it so why are we here ron asked dunno said fred we re just as clueless as you george said well maybe not that clueless fred added with a snicker professor ginny asked harry and ron are here now can you tell us what you needed to talk to us about mcgonagall nodded severely i am afraid she said that the recent developments of which i am about to speak will serve only to complicate matters what recent developments mr weasley asked mcgonagall paused and then said a second prophecy has been made harry felt the blood drain from his face what he said but about me yes mcgonagall said there are two names on this one as well me and voldemort harry said he didntthink he needed to guess you are indeed the first name mcgonagall told him but the second name belongs to miss weasley for every 93 people reading this story i get one review dontlet yourself be one of those other 92 people hehe disclaimer i dontown harry potter i woke up the morning after the last update to 107 reviews waiting for me in my inbox and i ve gotten more and more since then thank you all so so much chapter thirty five the second prophecy what what does it say fred asked ginny gulped and looked at harry who slowly took the seat beside her and stared at his shoes we do not know said mcgonagall as it is we have no way of hearing the prophecy so how do we find out what it says ginny asked finally finding her voice this was insane how could she and harry be prophesized about isntit obvious we have to go to the department of mysteries harry said quietly absolutely not mrs weasley cried no ginny isntgoing back there after what happened the first time round and harry isnteither for that matter molly mcgonagall said reasonably the circumstances under which they would travel to the department would be very different than in the past i will only agree said mrs weasley after a long moment if they go during the day with a guard several guards but then others will be there harry said i mean we cantclear the entire floor without attracting some attention can we i am afraid not mcgonagall said it will have to be at night no mrs weasley said stubbornly you ll just have to send someone else to retrieve it um molly dear mr weasley piped up if the prophecy only has ginny and harry names on it then they re the only ones who can get it i going harry said so am i ginny said instantly you are certainly not mrs weasley said ginevra weasley you will do as i tell you ginny glared at her mother but said nothing she knew that arguing with her mum was about as productive as arguing with a wall and twice as frustrating she would have to think of something she would sneak out if it came down to that surely harry would let her come with him for this i still going harry said when mrs weasley rounded on him really harry wasnteven going to fight to get permission for ginny to accompany him we need to hear this and if ginny cantgo i the only one who can get it harry when can i go professor he asked mcgonagall how about tonight you will need protection of course mcgonagall said kingsley shacklebolt and any team he puts together i in ron said immediately hermione will probably want to come too no way we re standing around doing nothing said george yeah fred agreed we re coming with you lot harry will be accompanied by aurors only mcgonagall said d you think voldemort side knows about this yet i received word of this news early this morning said mcgonagall though i suppose it is a possibility we need to be prepared for anything that may come up ginny reached out and clasped harry hand in her own he looked up at her briefly before dropping his gaze again she felt herself frown and tried to use their connection to speak with him but he kept his wall in place and wouldntlower it the adults argued back and forth for several more minute before mcgonagall held out her hand i will call a meeting with the order she said in the meantime these two she gestured to harry and ron should to get back to their training ron threw ginny a concerned look before leaving and she nearly forgot that he d been acting like such a prat not two hours earlier she wondered what had happened with her brother and harry but then upon noticing how both boys were wincing and moving so stiffly she decided she would rather not know harry stood and mumbled a goodbye before moving toward the door ginny wasntgiving in that easily tightening her grip on his hand she followed him not letting go until they were both out of dumbledore old office coming ron asked i harry said and by now he knew enough to know that the look ginny gave him meant trouble meet you at the pitch right ron said gruffly bye gin when her brother had taken his leave ginny turned back to harry mind telling me what happened in there she asked what d you mean you wouldnteven look at me harry i i know harry said i sorry he sighed i always dragging you into this stuff i d be involved regardless of our relationship she said softly maybe he said but you wouldntbe in this much danger there wouldntbe a prophecy with your name on it sitting in the department of mysteries right now merlin ginny do you even realize how risky this is how risky what is harry lowered his gaze again no she said fiercely and shoved him as hard as she could manage you arentdoing this you dontget to write me off because you re the boy who lived and i just your stupid little girlfriend maybe you re going to save the bloody world but when it comes to that prophecy i am just as important as you are i know that he yelled but you dontknow what this thing says it not i can tell you right now that it not going to be something good how do you know when is it ever something good he asked and his voice broke slightly she put her hand against his cheek it going to be okay and if it not what then then we just deal with it she said like always harry smiled slightly like always he repeated the weasleys had returned to the burrow just after hermione parents had left all of them seemingly on edge hermione looked to ginny for an answer but the girl shook her head and told hermione that ron could tell her when he got back from training when hermione nodded in acceptance ginny had trudged upstairs and gone into her room but not before throwing one last glare in the general direction of mrs weasley later when ron arrived home harry had stayed behind apparently to get in a few more hours of training he told her what had transpired in dumbledore office at hogwarts a second prophecy hermione asked ron nodded yeah that what mcgonagall says at least he told her anyway harry going to the department of mysteries tonight to hear it the department of mysteries hermione screeched but he do you think that best i mean after what happened there before ron shrugged i dunno he said harry seems to be okay with it i think he trying to forget about it hermione was beginning to feel rather unsettled forget how will he be able to forget ron this this isntgood this is exactly what i was talking about before we need to go with him there ll be aurors with him ron said sitting down beside her how much trouble can he get into with a whole bunch of guards keeping track of his every move what can we do for harry that they can t hermione frowned sometimes ron just didntget it the aurors hadntbeen there in fifth year when everything had happened they hadntbeen around after either when harry had kept apologizing and apologizing to them all saying that if it hadntbeen for the order he would ve led them all to their deaths that night regardless of whether it was true or not while harry had technically led them there and they may have died they had chosen to follow him and so it wasnthis fault at all was it hermione didntthink the aurors would understand how complicated this situation was what if harry stumbled across that veil again hermione would be lying if she said she didntfind it more than a little creepy the way harry had been so drawn to it both harry and luna had seemed to know something about it that hermione ron ginny and neville hadn t because they were both so fascinated that they d nearly gone right through she hadntthought it was something so terribly awful until after sirius had gone through and hadntever come back we just have to go she said i think it best if we do we can t said ron we wontbe allowed mum wonteven let ginny go and her name on the bloody thing ginny furious your mum canttell either of us what to do said hermione we re both of age well even if that true the aurors probably wontlet us come d you know how much of a risk they re taking just by letting harry go in after hours they wontwant two extra people that they have to watch hermione sighed he was right and she knew it but would she really be able to just sit back and let this happen harry was possibly the strongest person she knew but at the same time he was also the weakest his emotions often got the best of him and what stronger emotion was there than the love for someone lost harry didntopenly talk about sirius she could only remember one time when he spoke of his late godfather and that was to ginny really then how was anyone to know what he felt about sirius what if he got the idea in his head to reach into the veil and try to bring him back would it be possible what if he pulled someone else out what if harry was pulled in and then there was the concern that harry wouldntbe able to pull anyone out and he wouldntbe pulled in what would that do to him harry often took it upon himself to save everyone else and if he felt that he was the reason they were in such a situation just as he had with ginny and surely just as he still did with sirius he would stop at literally nothing to right his wrong ginny not allowed to go she asked after a long pause nope ron said i guess mum thinks that death eaters are going to be sitting up there waiting for everyone to walk through the doors so they can kill them he shook his head she doesntrealize that we re in just as much danger here as we are out there so you think ginny should be able to go ron made a face and then said what hermione had not expected yeah he said i guess the prophecy as much about her as it is about harry right and if harry does need someone to look after him like you say he does who better to do it than ginny she she the only one he d ever keep in line for hermione smiled gone and grown up have you ron stuck his tongue out at her and she rolled her eyes maybe not she said but i take it you ve decided against murdering harry for what happened at the party cantmurder him he said then who would beat voldemort who is it ginny called if it was her mum ginny wasntgoing to let her in she was still furious about not being able to go with harry tonight didntshe deserve to go the prophecy was about her after all she didnteven try to figure out her mother logic any longer this war must ve made her go insane ginny knew she could hardly blame her mum for being protective between percy ditching the family bill being wounded so badly ginny herself being taken at the wedding and the entire fiasco with ron not to mention that fred and george were constantly up to their ears in trouble and charlie was in danger every single day while working with those awful dragons mrs weasley had a right to worry but it was just so bloody inconveniencing sometimes and of course she got the worse of it she was the baby and the girl those were two strikes against her that she couldnterase no matter how hard she tried no matter how safe she already was and no matter how brilliantly she fought and protected herself she was used to it when it came to her family to an extent she could tolerate it and when she was in a good mood she could almost appreciate her parents and brothers concerns it was different with harry she was his girlfriend not his daughter and she had decided that it was about time that he learned the difference it was not up to harry potter to keep her safe she was her own person and she could take care of herself quite well but what was there to do running out on her own to prove how grown up she was would just do the opposite solidify everyone thoughts that she was too young and too irresponsible to handle taking up an active role in this war it wasntas though she could threaten to break up with harry unless he started to treat her better he treated her wonderfully except when it came to this one issue and she knew that if she threatened to ditch him unless he let her fight he would end up ditching her first to keep her safe he always had her best interests at heart git and if they did break up that would be awful she didnt want that she was fairly certain that harry potter was the one she was meant to spend the rest of her life with she couldntmake him see it her way and she couldntpossibly let him do things his way she had dug herself quite the hole it us come in then she said she sat up in her bed as ron and hermione entered her room i heard hermione said and you ve come to make everything all better ginny asked blandly actually hermione said ron and i are here to help you out so lose the attitude ron added with a small smile or we re out of here help me asked ginny skeptically how she felt her heart leap at the various ideas that entered her mind what were ron and hermione going to do for her she ordered herself not to get her hopes up of all people ron would not be helping her the way she really wanted to be helped finding some way to go with harry to retrieve the prophecy even if she had to pull the wool over harry eyes this one time she was willing to do it whatever it took we talked it over said ron and we think mum making a stupid decision so ginny asked though not rudely hermione closed the door and then produced harry invisibility cloak from behind her back she said so we re getting you to the department of mysteries harry arrived home from training twenty minutes later ginny had come out of her room by then and everyone traveled to headquarters by floo powder her mood had lightened considerably but she tried to come off as upset as possible she didntwant her mum wondering why she was suddenly so cheery and since she was going to make her mum think she had locked herself in one of the rooms in grimmauld place to sulk while really she would be off at the department of mysteries she decided she had better start acting miserable now her heart was thumping so fiercely that she thought for sure the others would hear was she really even considering pulling this off and how was she going to convince harry to help her she had the invisibility cloak on her and even if harry argued with her and refused to let her come she was going to go anyway he didnthave to know when she saw her opportunity she pulled harry aside and they spoke in hushed tones i coming with you she said what he asked and much to ginny surprise he didntsound very annoyed just yet did your mum change her mind she shook her head then how re you going to be coming with me he asked she took a deep breath and forced herself to explain the plan to him just as hermione had told her i going to use your invisibility cloak to sneak out and you re going to make sure nobody catches me for the life of her she couldntget a read on what was going through his mind his face was completely expressionless almost to the point that she had to wonder if someone had just stunned him from behind harry took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt what do i need to do he asked he was crazy to be letting her come with him he was likely to get in loads of trouble with the aurors if ginny was discovered but what could he do this mission was as much his as it was hers and even he couldntturn a deaf ear to her when it came to this prophecy the cloak fit her more comfortably than it did him and as he walked around grimmauld place he had to wonder if she was even following him any longer she made virtually no noise whatsoever as she walked they had lowered their walls for the occasion harry thought this was for the best he didntneed ginny getting misplaced and left behind in the department of mysteries because he couldntcall out to her without the aurors noticing he knew mrs weasley was liable to kill him as it was imagining what would happen if he couldntfind ginny was something he didntwant to contemplate just now where are you right beside you was her reply and he felt a hand smack his bottom he wasntexactly sure how they were going to work this entire scheme but he knew that ron and hermione were going to cover for them he was rather pleasantly surprised that they were both willing to spend their entire night downstairs with mr and mrs weasley in order to make sure nobody went upstairs to where ginny was supposed to be and discovered that she wasntthere crossing his fingers he turned and faced lupin and the aurors kingsley and tonks responsible for getting him to and from the department safely little did they know they were also responsible for ginny weasley and keeping an eye on her was easier said than done and not only because she was wearing an invisibility cloak no way we ll all fit in there tonks said looking at the telephone box i ll go first remus can go with harry kingsley can come in last they all nodded in agreement harry waited a moment as tonks went into the telephone box and followed procedure once she was gone harry stepped into the box he felt a brush against his arm and knew that ginny had entered the small area just before him lupin followed in behind him and harry made certain that he put himself between the two if he could help it he was going to make sure nobody ever found out that ginny had come tonight even though he was fairly certain lupin would cover for them harry wasntwilling to take the chance six two four four two lupin muttered under his breath as he dialed a cool female voice somewhat familiar to harry spoke welcome to the ministry of magic please sate your name and business oh this was not going to be good would the invisibility cloak hide ginny or would some sort of alarm go off if harry only said two names because magic would be able to tell that there were three people in the telephone box remus lupin and harry potter lupin said he went to continue but harry interjected and ginny weasley he muttered out of total obligation and then looked up at lupin to gauge how much trouble he was in lupin looked confused for only a moment before smiling of course he said and ginny weasley the three of us are here to take a tour of the ministry that was the best excuse they could come up with harry heard ginny snicker but apparently the reason was accepted thank you visitors please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes harry didnteven read the badge he was handed just pinned it to his robes and waited for the telephone box to begin moving visitors of the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium harry closed his eyes and willed the silly little box to move faster finally after what seemed like ages it stopped moving the ministry wishes you a pleasant evening so many shelves ginny muttered to herself she couldntremember there being this many prophecies the last time she was here they had all blown out the shelves to cause a distraction which had destroyed hundreds maybe even thousands of prophecy records was it possible that more had been made since then exactly how often were prophecies made lupin had offered to help harry look around while the other aurors stood guard seeing her opening ginny snuck in the door before harry and now the three of them were eagerly scanning the shelves she was not surprised that lupin had reacted the way he did he was an adult and a strong member of the order but ginny still considered him to be someone she could trust and go to if she had a problem he was the closest thing harry had to a father and if ginny had to tell someone the secret about their connection she would probably choose lupin they all searched in silence for quite some time the words seemed to blur before ginny eyes she had read so many names by this point that she wasnteven certain she would recognize her own or harry s if she were to come across their prophecy found it harry called the relief and anxiety evident in his voice let get the hell out of here they got back to headquarters and ginny scurried upstairs quickly then threw off the invisibility cloak and came back downstairs do you have it she asked yeah harry said and held it out to her he turned to tonks where can we go to listen to it upstairs mcgonagall said i ll show you where harry and ginny followed their old professor up the stairs of grimmauld place and down a corridor until they arrived at a room ginny couldntremember ever being in before she glanced at harry and he looked equally confused they had explored this house from top to bottom when they d stayed here previously how had they missed this room had it been locked all this time can we listen to it by ourselves harry asked do you think that is wise mcgonagall asked i cannot express how important this prophecy is if you forget exactly the phrasing we won t harry said quickly promise potter mcgonagall said sternly you had better not disappoint me harry held up his hands and mcgonagall nodded she looked at them thoughtfully for another second and then left you ready he asked the two of them stepping into the room he closed the door behind him clutching the small ball in his hands she swallowed i love you she said suddenly even if if it something bad i not going to stop i going to hold you to that he said but she got the feeling it came out more serious than he d intended he asked again so ready she nodded harry took his hand off of the ball and ginny watched as it the precious prophecy that stood to ruin everything she d worked so hard for fell to the floor and smashed into a million pieces she shut her eyes tight it felt like hours before a small voice rang out the one with the power is unforeseen and unsuspecting she is the beginning and end for only together can the true power be harnessed but the dark light is forever lurking inside and she is the one who shall be led astray once more and only too late will it be discovered but either must die at the hand of the other and redemption must be found in the purest of sacrifices for only then can goodness prevail the one with the power is unforeseen and unsuspecting ginny looked up at harry what what does that mean she asked the question hung in the air just a second longer than she d hoped i dunno he said if the power means the same as it does in the first prophecy then it love she had figured that already she was focusing more on another part the darkness that forever lurked inside that would be tom ginny didnthave to wonder she is the one who shall be led astray once more she quoted but it was impossible that someone a seer would prophesize ginny becoming a traitor unless there was another meaning does that mean what i think it means she must mean me since i the only other name on the prophecy but that doesntmake sense led astray i would never i know he said though with great difficulty but how could i mean it even references the other prophecy ginny sniffed this isntgood she whispered this isntgood at all it ll be okay he said she shook her head what do what do we do we do the only thing we can do harry said without a moment hesitation we lie we make something up she sniffed again and harry frowned obviously realizing that she was beginning to cry c mon quit it he pleaded we cantpull this off if everyone sees you like this after wiping her tears away with his thumb he pulled her into his arms and whispered we need to come up with a fake prophecy to tell everyone but we cantdo that she said everything was vanishing before her eyes the prophecy is a big deal we cantlie to the order harry if someone were to find out we d be in so much trouble that why we make sure nobody finds out he said dumbledore said once that a prophecy only comes true if the people in it make it true we just wontmake it true nobody ever needs to know it was a foolish plan with many flaws but in this moment of desperation it sounded perfect to ginny okay she said slowly but do you think we should at least tell someone about our connection i mean maybe we can use this somehow no said harry we cantdo that please she was startled why not because he said everything that i do my wandless magic sensing voldemort with my scar mcgonagall and the others always make a big deal about it and study it and try to define it somehow they cheapen it they exploit it and i not going to let them do that with what we have together this is this is the only thing that matters to me they can use my power and my mother love and even me for that matter all they want but they cantuse this ginny nodded against him i dontwant them to use it either she said it just harry sometimes you have to admit we dontmake the best decisions i know harry said and the minute we notice something is going wrong we ll tell dumbledore the truth but until then i cantdo it gin i canttell him can you she shook her head no she said i canttell dumbledore either and if either of them had bothered to look at the small portrait that was barely visible in the dark shadows of the room they would have realized that professor dumbledore had already heard everything dontforget to check out my new one shot lacking i going to be on a trip with friends for a week or so and so the next update will be in two weeks sorry for the inconvenience hope everyone has a great long weekend disclaimer i dontown harry potter this passing long weekend i took a nice five day trip to quebec city and montreal it really gorgeous there and french is so my favourite language and then i spent four days of last week in ottawa needless to say i ve spent far too much money this past month i ended up rewriting this entire chapter just a few things i needed to incorporate that i couldntput off any longer hope this is what all you people saying what about that polyjuice thing have been waiting for chapter thirty six the department revisited molly weasley was not easily controlled ron knew this of course he did he had nearly eighteen years of experience being her son keeping her away from the room ginny pretended to shut herself away in was admittedly harder than ron had expected he and hermione struggled to keep his mum busy all night in hindsight some of the things they d come up with to occupy her time seemed a bit silly but the pair had been desperate ron mum tried to go up to ginny room fifteen times if she tried once ginny hasntcome down at all mrs weasley speculated yeah ron said well she still a little upset hermione supplied i should go up and speak with her no ron cried i mean you know how ginny is she ll get over it actually it was probably nothing short of a miracle that stopped mrs weasley from realizing what was happening right under her nose really the weasley family went to extensive measures to keep themselves safe but ginny had slipped away completely undetected when everyone returned home it was as though an enormous weight was lifted off of ron shoulders he was relieved that he no longer had to keep careful watch of his mum for if it had been discovered that ginny was gone there was no doubt in ron mind that it would soon be realized that he and hermione had been a part of the cover up but even more than that he was so relieved that everyone was safe and sound having to sit around headquarters while harry was out on a mission gave ron a new appreciation for ginny his sister was always forced to stay behind and he had never truly realized how frustrating and nerve wracking it could be until then the entire night in the back of his mind he was wondering what harry and ginny were doing at that moment he wondered if they had any trouble getting into the ministry he wondered if ginny had been discovered he wondered if they had met any unexpected trouble along the way and if anyone was injured after all they did not have the best track record when it came to the department of mysteries while harry and ginny were upstairs listening to the prophecy ron curiosity nearly got the best of him he squirmed in his chair knowing that harry and ginny deserved to hear it first alone but also dying to know what it said it was no secret that this prophecy much like the last one would greatly influence the rest of the war what if ginny was in danger because of this if voldemort got wind of this prophecy actually ron would be surprised if voldemort hadntheard at least a whispering of the news by now would he come after ginny but no he had already come after ginny twice who was to say it wouldnthappen a third time ron was suddenly enveloped by the strongest sense of protectiveness he d ever felt toward ginny falling victim to a diary when she was eleven was an awful thing but if tom riddle somehow found a way to hurt her now ron would die before he let it happen hermione hand touched his and he flinched it was only then that he realized he d been clutching onto the arm of his chair so tightly that his knuckles had turned white how long is this prophecy ron muttered he suddenly heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs and his sister appeared around the corner followed closely by harry right away ron could tell that something was off hermione must ve sensed it too they exchanged looks and stood quickly is everything all right hermione asked ginny nodded yeah yeah fine can we all listen to it now ron asked he didntmiss the look that passed between his best friend and his little sister what he asked harry just smiled and ron had been around him enough to know that it was forced sure he said ginny and i wrote it down i ll read it he began but mcgonagall cut him off not so fast she said we need to go to hogwarts and alert albus of this before anyone else hears what the prophecy has to say ron frowned but said nothing he followed everyone through the fireplace to hogwarts and then up to dumbledore office where the rest of the portraits began grumbling about being woken up before we begin dumbledore said i am afraid that i will need to speak with harry and miss weasley alone as i do not have the luxury of moving about as i once did would you all be so kind as to step out for a moment albus motioned to the two seats at his desk and harry and ginny took them once everyone else had gone he spoke harry he began do you recall a conversation we had not very long ago in which you asked me about my other portraits harry furrowed his brow er yes he said you said that there was one in a place called spinner end and another one in grimmauld place yes the portrait said i am willing to bet that neither of you have ever been in the room you used tonight to listen to the prophecy you see there was a reason that minerva brought you to that particular room he heard harry curse softly under his breath and knew that the boy understood so you heard then harry said finally ginny mouth dropped open you heard everything didntyou i did indeed you know that the prophecy we plan on reading to everyone isntthe real one albus nodded i am truly sorry he said but i cannot allow you to share your fabricated prophecy with the others you will need to tell the truth and if we dontwant to harry said i also heard what the prophecy said albus said and if you do not wish to share the contents i will simply have to do it for you professor ginny said please cantyou reconsider put yourself in our shoes i cannot lie to the order miss weasley said albus to be quite honest i am rather displeased to find that either of you would we re sorry very sorry we just we dontagree with what the prophecy says you said it yourself harry piped up a prophecy is only true if we make it true to an extent said albus harry surely you must realize how dangerous withholding the truth from me could have been harry looked down i did what i had to he said you told me over and over that love is what i need to beat voldemort i have that now and now this stupid prophecy is saying what that i cant love ginny because she going to become a a traitor that ridiculous how do we even know that this prophecy wasntjust made up by someone on voldemort side albus clasped his hands together though he did not agree with harry decision to lie he could not deny that he understood the boy need to protect ginny weasley harry potter had been through so much and there would be so much more to come of course that albus often forgot the boy experiences in the magical world spanned a mere six years ginny weasley had asked albus to put himself in their shoes but the truth of the matter was that albus had once been in harry potter place he remembered quite well the burden that was an uncertain destiny tom riddle was not the first of his kind before there was lord voldemort there had been grindelwald and before there was harry potter boy who lived there was albus dumbledore and it had been up to him to eliminate the evil that threatened their world in a moment i am going to ask you to go and tell minerva that everyone is allowed back into this office albus said ignoring harry question once this happens one of us will recite the prophecy the true prophecy it is up to you to decide whether it is you or i who will disclose this information harry jaw clenched as though with great difficulty he ripped the piece of paper in half the knowledge and insight albus dumbledore could offer harry was quite clearly of no interest to the boy and in truth albus was not certain he wanted offer harry his assistance in this sense for albus had learned that one needed to learn some things on their own ginny didntthink she d ever been this nervous in her life having to make up a prophecy and lie to everyone was one thing having to tell the truth and really there was no way to gauge how everyone would take that truth was a whole other thing entirely would her mother cry would hermione try somewhat pointlessly to make perfect sense of everything she wondered what could be worse a bad reaction or no reaction at all it was no secret that many of her brothers did not like her relationship with harry few of them seemed to realize that if anyone was going to be able to protect her it was him bill was mostly involved in his own life at the moment he had a new wife after all and he was still somewhat recovering from what had happened to him at hogwarts but despite her efforts to remain blissfully unaware she was certain that charlie disapproved of her being with harry she had been picking up on the looks he d been giving her for weeks now she didntknow if it was because harry potter had become just another synonym for danger and she was now tied to that danger or because charlie was her big brother and didntwant to think that she was with any boy ginny couldnttell being that percy had only just come back to the family he was not in any position to lecture ginny or anyone else in any way and he knew it still ginny was sure that he had his opinions if there was one thing she had learned about percy while growing up that was it he always had opinions on everything even when nobody was asking him the twins made a lot of jokes but ginny knew that they were actually quite protective of her underneath everything she had heard them discussing her once before when they hadntrealized that she was there they spoke of her in a way that had it been anyone else would have infuriated her but because it was them she had just smiled and then walked away and ron well there was no wondering on this one he made it awfully clear how he felt about his baby sister and his best friend as long as they didntkiss or touch or do any of that fun stuff ron was happy that they were together you ready harry asked her as everyone came back into the office she could only manage a feeble nod reaching into her bra she pulled out another small piece of paper on this one they had written the correct prophecy so they could look at it later and scrutinize it away from prying eyes ginny hated that she would not even have enough time to make sense of these words before her family got to hear them as well still she cleared her throat and read the words that she had hastily jotted down not thirty minutes before when she was finished she avoided looking up by keeping her eyes on the paper until finally the words began to blur together let do this one line at a time lupin suggested and ginny thought that was a smashing idea he motioned for her to re read the first line the one with the power is unforeseen and unsuspecting ginny read the power fred said that must be referencing the first prophecy harry said he looked at mcgonagall right mcgonagall nodded yes she said indeed it does sound that way she is the beginning and the end for only together can the truth power be harnessed ginny read this one must be you ginny percy said it says she and you re the only female whose name is on the prophecy and unforeseen and unsuspecting it certainly sounds correct ginny agreed with this too for who in their right might would suspect that little ginny weasley could be holding the fate of the wizarding world in the palm of her hand but ginny began and then swallowed thickly the dark light is forever lurking inside and she is the one who shall be led astray once more and only too late will it be discovered mr weasley frowned the dark light he said could that mean tom riddle he was the one who led her astray before probably harry said wait mrs weasley said dubiously am i to believe that my daughter has a part of lord voldemort inside of her and that he going to turn her into a traitor that ridiculous was it ginny could not deny that the voice inside of her head was sometimes not her own may we have the next line please mcgonagall requested clearly for the time being not one of them was prepared or willing to address the issue of ginny turning to the dark side but either must die at the hand of the other and redemption must be found in the purest of sacrifices for only then can goodness prevail the first part again goes back to the original prophecy harry said it nearly word for word nobody disputed this instead charlie spoke up what is this sacrifice and who is going to be making it he threw a rather nasty glance at harry and ginny felt suddenly inexplicably compelled to draw her wand and bat bogey hex her brother until he wiped that awful look off of his face a pure sacrifice hermione said there are only a few things that it can be what are they well said hermione and ginny felt certain that this information was to be quoted directly from a book her friend had read in the library for a sacrifice to be pure it must be something that is difficult for the doer to complete but something that nobody would ever ask him or her to do how is that any different from a regular old sacrifice a pure sacrifice she continued has to involve pure emotions what purer emotion is there than love this isntlike being cold because you took off your jacket to give to a shivering girl or cutting back on luxury items because money is tight it isntabout doing something because you feel a sense of duty it about doing something because you want to think about the things that you would gladly do for a loved one that you wouldntdo for someone you merely liked or hardly knew for that matter dying ron said hermione nodded when you attempted to save ginny she said that was a pure sacrifice see the difference you wouldntdie for the person behind you in line at the ministry but you would die for the person across from you at the dinner table what about when harry almost died to save that girl george asked hermione smiled at harry well there are extraordinary circumstances that cancel this out but dying for a stranger is incredibly rare nobody is dying for anybody mrs weasley said sternly least of all ginny bill added several people in the room nodded at this and ginny wondered if any of them realized that if it came down to living without harry or dying so harry could live she would choose the second option in a heartbeat harry fell back against his bed and sighed he was so exhausted that he could barely stand he had been awake for well over twenty four hours his body needed sleep but his mind was screaming for him to stay up and examine this prophecy more thoroughly he felt that there was something more to it than he was seeing and if he could just find a new way to approach the subject he d be able to figure out what it all meant or maybe this was just wishful thinking and he should ask hermione in the morning he wondered if he and ginny should tell hermione about their newfound connection having all the facts would certainly make it easier for hermione to help them he spent longer on his occlumency tonight than he normally did but then again he had more pressing on his mind than he normally did at last he closed his eyes and felt himself drifting off to sleep there was a soft pop somewhere to his right whoever was apparating into charlie old bedroom to disturb him was certainly not welcome at this moment in time groaning and refusing to open his eyes he grumbled out what get up hermione said quickly we have to get to headquarters now harry sat up why what happened there was another pop and ron appeared beside hermione there an attack at the ministry hermione said mcgonagall thinks voldemort might be there ron added reaching down deep and finding the energy he needed to get out of bed harry jumped up and began pulling on the closest pair of trousers he could find there was something else something that hermione and ron werenttelling him he could feel it one didntgrow up with two people without being able to tell when they werentbeing completely honest what else he asked hermione hesitated then she said they went to level nine the department of mysteries hermione remembered with impeccable detail the last time she was at the department of mysteries she remembered how the air had been charged that night how everything had seemed to move in slow motion how her senses had been so acute that she could sense every breath ron took beside her she remembered the fight and the injury and the overwhelming danger of the situation she remembered how they had broken countless rules by sneaking out of school as well as by breaking into the ministry she remembered how all six of them had nearly died that night she remembered that she had never felt that alive not before and probably not even since she had argued with ron nearly every single day but she had never been in a true fight with wands before the end of her fifth year in fact up until then she and ron had mostly sat on the sidelines while harry fought it out she knew that she was a valuable member of their trio and that she contributed things that nobody else could knowledge and rationality and sober thought but despite this it was harry getting the stone at the end of first year and it was harry saving ginny at the end of their second third year hadntbeen a fight so much as it had been a long giant misunderstanding between everyone it was harry in fourth year pulled through a portkey while ron and hermione sat in the stands and wondered why nobody had come out of the maze yet but fifth year they had taken a more active aggressive role true both she and ron hadntlasted very long in the battle but that was beside the point really if it hadntbeen for the order and dumbledore even harry wouldnthave lasted past that night ready at ron words hermione was brought back to the present they were standing in a spot they d stood in just over one year ago after their thestral ride but before they had encountered the veil yeah she said she clutched her wand the words kill the spare echoed in harry mind and he wondered why the hell ginny was with them right now they d all scrambled out of the house and rushed out to the ministry as quickly as they could and amidst all the excitement nobody had thought to ask why ginny wasntstaying at headquarters this was so bad harry couldnteven believe that this was happening it was no coincidence that voldemort and his death eaters had come to the department of mysteries mere hours after harry ginny and the order had they had gotten wind of the prophecy they must have but how who was there a snitch within the order harry knew the answer before he d even asked the question of course there wasn t in truth harry had been somewhat suspicious of percy when he suddenly decided to return to the family but percy seemed generally remorseful about the way he d treated his parents and the way he d turned his back on everyone harry had never really held percy in high regard but he knew better than to think that even he was capable of being a spy for voldemort so ruling out the order how could voldemort have known did he send someone to spy like he had when the first prophecy was made and the person had overheard again if that was the case harry wondered how much of this second prophecy had been passed to voldemort had he heard it all or had he only heard a portion of it like last time what would happen when it was discovered that the prophecy had already been taken from the department of mysteries and listened to or was it possible that voldemort didnthave any clue there was a prophecy with harry and ginny name on it could he be looking for something else there was a rule at hogwarts that teachers and students were not allowed to be romantically involved in any way hermione believed that this rule was a necessity granted most of the teachers at hogwarts were old or dull or unattractive or any combination of those three but every now and again a teacher came along who had beautiful hair and straight white teeth and a smile that could turn a student into a puddle of goo on the floor lockhart for example this rule was in place for several reasons primarily it was because teachers could not be biased and any student who was er getting private lessons from a teacher was likely to receive marks higher than what they deserved favouritism it was called and favouritism applied to several things not just in class while patrolling she and ron had often caught harry or ginny or seamus outside of gryffindor tower after hours but instead of deducting house points or giving them a detention ron would send them off without a warning and hermione rarely said anything about it in the workplace office romances were discouraged dating a co worker could get in the way of your work especially if you had a messy break up being involved with an employee meant that you might give them the more popular jobs or the promotions that others deserved but in war when the person you loved was facing death you were far more likely to favour them hermione experienced this firsthand when battle broke out and instead of going to help moody who was struggling to fight four death eaters at once she went to ron who was easily handling two it would not be until much later when hermione would discover moody fate that she would wonder if she should have gone to him instead by the time she got across the room to ron she was out of breath and had nearly been stunned twice but it was a good thing that hermione did go to ron because just as both death eaters went down a third came up behind him giving him no time to react avada it felt as if everything was happening at once but it was all moving in slow motion and hermione could see two and three moves ahead of herself she saw herself raising her wand and crying out and then she was doing it touching on something she d never even known was inside of her crucio the person screamed and there was a voice in her head telling her to stop but she didn t she didntwant to nobody was taking ron away nobody was even going to attempt it not if she had anything to say about it for a split second she wondered if she had just lowered herself to the death eaters level still she did not let up hermione ron grabbed her and pulled the wand out of her hand she felt as though she had just been slammed back into her own body as though she had been someone else just now suddenly the energy was draining from her the overwhelming feelings flowing out of her and she was left looking at ron with wide eyes i just she said there was a loud scream and hermione would have paid it no attention except that she knew who it was ginny ron said looking around desperately finally they spotted her she was fighting against the death eater that was restraining her and then before anyone could react she was dragged out of the room and down a corridor then they saw harry taking off after her something was wrong with this harry could feel it but what was he supposed to do not go after ginny because of a weird feeling harry it was ron where d she go he didntknow but it was too much effort to speak all of his energy was going toward finding ginny so he communicated his confusion by looking around wildly could he use wandless magic to find her honestly he didnteven know how he would go about that so he figured it probably wasntsmart to waste time trying harry help it was ginny he felt the same sense of terror grip his heart but he also got the same strange feeling that he was walking into yet another trap this way ron said and they took off in the direction from where ginny voice was coming the second harry turned the corner and spotted her standing by herself in the middle of the darkened room he knew what the problem was if ginny needed him and needed him to find her why wouldntshe use their connection to tell him where she was and why wouldntshe ginny yeah where are you with tonks she hurt and i guarding her so you re fine you re not with ron and me right now i donteven know where you and ron are why what wrong it nothing i ll explain later just please be careful ron harry whispered that that not ginny what ron cried what d you mean of course it is no insisted harry it not it a polyjuice harry dontgo near her ron stepped forward toward who he thought was his sister and harry reached out to pull him back again it a trap he hissed harry would run to ginny and then voldemort would appear and kill ron and then make harry duel him or perhaps he had learned from previous mistakes and would simply do away with harry the moment he got his chance ginny not in trouble this isnther ron spun around and stared at harry as if he had three heads how do you know that the person pretending to be ginny reached into her robes and pulled out a wand pointing it at ron back she said cruc stupefy harry cried out shooting the spell over ron shoulder at the stranger ron looked bewildered how could you how could you tell harry did not want to explain that especially not here c mon he said instead let get back they both looked over each other shoulders as they ran back to the fight but along the way harry caught sight of something that was far more pressing that any battle in the department of mysteries i ll catch up to you he said what go back to the fight said harry i ll be right there where re you going i said i ll catch up to you ron stared at him long and hard before leaving once he was gone harry rushed off after draco disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter thirty seven avada kedavra draco waited but even after several minutes he didnthear the telltale sounds of battle he cursed feeling himself beginning to panic had potter and weasley figured out it was a trap that it was really pansy parkinson under all that ugly red hair and freckles for a fleeting second he let himself be concerned over pansy what would happen to her would potter torture her for information after all draco had learned not to put anything past harry potter when it came to ginny weasley but then the second was up and draco did what he did best began to focus on himself again he couldntafford another failure what would the dark lord do when he found out that draco had messed up again it was nothing short of a miracle that the dark lord had spared him after the fiasco at hogwarts the only reason he was still involved was because his father was continuously promising that draco would learn that it would be smart for the dark lord to keep him around because one day he would be a better more loyal servant than anyone had ever been before but draco didntthink he could be a loyal servant truthfully he could not imagine living the life his father lived in and out of azkaban never knowing when the dark lord would grow angry and do away with him he didntwant that in fact he wasnteven sure he wanted to fight anymore all throughout hogwarts he had anticipated the day he could finally become a death eater he had dreamt about the day he would get the chance to earn his dark mark battle and murder and power had once been words that enticed him beyond all else he was still up for the power but battle these battles were different than the silly encounters he d had with weasley and potter in the corridors at school they were different than the duel he d challenged potter to in their first year here he didnthave crabbe and goyle to protect him he was on his own and as he was discovering he wasntas gifted with a wand as he d once thought perhaps paying attention in class something he d done only in potions so he didntmiss it when snape pointed out potter mistakes or nearly reduced granger to tears would have been an idea at least worth entertaining and murder he hadnteven been able to go through with killing dumbledore a senile old man who played for the other team one that he did not like or even respect if snape had had to bail him out then what would happen next time draco had spent most of his life thinking knowing that he was on a higher level than everyone around him he was a malfoy after all his name alone communicated everything he always got what he wanted because of who his father was but the dark lord didntcare about who his father was and harry potter side certainly didntcare about that he could be killed just as quickly as weasley and look at who his father was it seemed that there was no way out of this mess this time draco did one of the few things he seemed to do well anymore he fled perhaps if he found a way to get home before he was caught he would have enough time to pack a bag and disappear forever he might even be able to convince his mum to come with him after all his mum was in just as much danger as he was they were all guilty by association lucius malfoy involvement with the dark side had pretty much sealed all three of their fates years and years ago and the dark lord had threatened to have his mum killed unless draco succeeded in capturing potter which draco now knew he could not draco ran but spun around when he heard footsteps behind him a pair of strong hands wrapped around his forearms and he was shoved against the wall it took him a moment before he realized who he was looking at what did i say before harry potter spat he said nothing he knew very well what potter was talking about what did i say before he was vaguely aware of how pitiful he was of all the ways to meet his end having it delivered to him by harry potter was possibly the last way he would have chosen he wondered if potter would be too noble and too good to actually carry through on his promise to kill him even after everything potter was still a bloody saint he really wouldntbe able to live up to his promise of killing draco would he sometimes potter was downright sickening but this time draco was holding his breath and praying for potter mercy but he recognized the look in potter eyes it was the same one he used to see when he looked in the mirror p please malfoy choked out nearly sobbing it was pathetic but then again so was he please dontki shut up harry yelled he wasnteven sure what he was really about to do but he felt certain that he wouldntbe able to do it if malfoy verbalized it there was no question in harry mind that he could do this but did he want to it was almost as if he had risen out of his body and was now floating several feet in the air looking down on himself and malfoy and he saw it as clear as day draco malfoy was a boy who had been quite unfortunately caught up in this war he was trying as best he could to survive another day malfoy hadntchosen to be born into the role of voldemort follower any more than harry had been chosen to be born into the role of voldemort conqueror but harry was going to rise to the occasion because there was nothing else for him and draco well perhaps there was nothing else for him either in reality he was hardly any different from harry as harry was beginning to learn nothing was ever as it seemed there was no black or white only grey and the line between right and wrong could often be blurred or even washed away entirely this war this life was as much about the things you did as it was about the things you did not do the choices made and the actions executed were just as important as the desires stifled and the impulses ignored who was he to decide what was right and what was wrong harry perspective was different from malfoy or wormtail or scrimgeour or even ginny s no one else was the one destined for heroism like harry no one else felt the burden and pressure he experienced daily but then again nobody else was living malfoy life harry knew that his side was the right side but if he was malfoy would he not think that voldemort was the answer to the world problems or would he not at the very least hold his tongue and follow his orders but that therein itself lay the problem malfoy might have thought that what he did was right but at this current moment in time harry was the one in position to decide who was right and who was wrong and so he decided to do the most loving thing he thought he could do for someone like malfoy he decided to set him free he gritted his teeth and told himself then and there that he would not allow himself feel bad about this later on he d seen the curse several times before but it had never seemed to glow as green as it did now coming from the tip of his own wand several of the order members including tonks and lupin needed to be treated by audrey and earl so the meeting at headquarters was postponed until after everyone was properly looked after this was fine with harry he hadntgotten a decent night sleep in three days hell it was past lunch now and he hadnteven been to bed yet he fancied a nap and a cancelled order meeting was exactly what he needed to get it he said nothing the entire way home and would not open his mind to ginny though he could feel her trying to get in while the rest of the household stayed in the kitchen to eat the food mrs weasley was making harry slipped past them all and climbed the stairs to his room should he tell them what he had done or could they all tell he felt as though there was a sign hanging above his head would they simply not want to know if mrs weasley found out would she kick him out of her house he wasntcompletely blind he picked up on the looks ginny had been giving him she was concerned but she didntknow what he had done if she knew she wouldnteven look at him at all at best she would look at him the way she would look at a stranger or someone she detested he was carrying around a secret one that he knew for certain he couldnttell anyone he could do it too he was very practiced at keeping large secrets after all but this secret felt as though it would kill him if he didntget it off his chest if he kept it tightly wrapped up and locked away down deep inside of him he had attempted to get ron attention he could tell ron ron would understand and ron wouldntjudge him and ron wouldntget that awful look on his face the one he knew hermione or mrs weasley or even lupin would have if he confided in them instead but ron had been too preoccupied with an intense looking conversation he was having with hermione to notice that harry needed him his hands felt dirty and so the first thing he did was wash them he scrubbed and scrubbed but the feeling didntgo away it was as if something was stained onto his skin something that only he could see or could the others see it too he looked at his reflection in the mirror and saw ginny standing behind him mum asked me to come up to see if you wanted her to send you up anything to eat she said hesitantly i saw malfoy at the ministry harry said softly hoping ginny would understand what this meant she didn t or perhaps she did but she said nothing and harry hoped it was because she didntknow what he meant rather than she was too busy trying to come up with a way to get away from him that she was forgetting to speak he dead now he added if she didntunderstand this he would just have to come up with another way he couldntsay the actual words ginny eyes widened at the news of malfoy death and then she gasped when she put two and two together and realized what harry was implying did you do it she asked bluntly before she could stop herself well at least she d finally figured it out he looked down and said tell your mum not to bother i ll be down shortly he could feel her eyes on him for several more moments and he could tell that she was struggling to say something or to not say something finally she left without another word he let out a breath he hadntrealized he d been holding he wondered what would happen next he wondered about the horcruxes about the final battle about himself and ginny he felt as though his mind was operating on another level but really it was probably only because of a lack of sleep wasntit he leaned toward the sink and splashed water on his face he could not deny the strange unfamiliar surge of feeling he d experienced earlier after what had happened with malfoy it was unlike anything he d felt before even while doing wandless magic this was power he had felt responsible for everything that had happened to his parents and sirius and dumbledore and ginny and ron but it was only after his meeting with malfoy that he did realize the true weight and burden of murder even so strangely harry could not feel guilty about what he had done if anything he felt ashamed and even somewhat afraid but not for the reasons for which he knew he should he had to some degree enjoyed the feeling the rush that had accompanied his encounter with draco so much so that he knew he would not be opposed to doing it again if only to experience that same feeling but wasntthat completely sick and awful was a warning bell going off in his mind at this very moment he wondered if tom riddle had felt this way after his first kill first kill there would be more harry nearly shuddered with delight at the thought he wondered if riddle had become what he was lord voldemort because of this feeling hermione often said that harry was ruled by his emotions was it possible to be ruled by this as well would harry head down the same path as voldemort he knew that he was probably overreacting after all it had only been one time but wasntthat even more of a concern it had only been once and already in the back of his mind he was thinking about next time what he would do differently how it would feel what he would say who it would be in muggle storybooks the heroes always triumphed always overcame the evil and the countless temptations but was it possible for heroes to make the wrong choice to become the very thing they were born to defeat just because those stories were never published and read to small children did that mean it wasntpossible that it never happened from time to time was it really so hard to believe that the line between good and evil blurred so much that one did not even realize when he or she had crossed it what if the prophecy had gotten it wrong what if it wasntginny who would be led astray but harry he would do anything to protect ginny and win this war even if it meant getting his hands dirty in the process but wasntlove supposed to save him in the end could it be possible that love would also be his destruction with love he knew that he would make it through this war but what if the person he was when all was said and done wasntwho he d started out as this newfound sense of euphoria was still rushing through his veins harry took a good long look at himself in the mirror his eyes were just as green as his mum had been and his hair was messy and always stuck up in the back just like his dad had his experiences growing up had never been truly influenced by his parents still sirius and lupin had always said he d received his good heart from his mother and that lily would be proud of how kind he could be harry knew that his dad was the reason he had such a knack for getting into troublesome situations and he was willing to bet that it was not a coincidence that both he and his father had fallen in love with fiery strong willed women these things had been handed down directly from his parents but then as he continued to examine his reflection his eyes came to rest on his scar and harry was forced to wonder though not for the first time if his parents were not the only people who had passed some of their traits onto him harry said nothing at headquarters he merely sat back and let ron speak listening as his friend described the trap involving a polyjuiced version of ginny he decided that his biggest concern for the moment was going to be trying to stay awake throughout this boring meeting now reflecting upon the events at the department of mysteries he was relieved that he had actually recognized this trap for what it was it appeared that his training with mcgonagall was paying off more than he d realized not only was she teaching him to harness and strengthen his magic but she was also teaching him how to calm himself and properly assess critical situations with a clear level head he had certainly been able to do that today he knew he shouldntgive himself too much credit though it was his own fault that he and ron had been tricked in the first place when it was first speculated that the other side could be planning on polyjuicing ginny the girl had been forced to cut and highlight her hair she had been given a bracelet that tracked her every move which she was never supposed to take off after a while harry had begun to notice that ginny hadntbeen wearing her bracelet on top of that she had used a glamour charm to get rid of the highlights in her hair eventually her hair had begun to grow longer and it was now difficult to tell that she d gotten it cut at all with everything that had been going on around headquarters and the burrow nobody else had seemed to notice that all the precautions they had taken to protect ginny had been erased seemingly overnight harry had noticed of course but he had made the decision not to say anything unless she was going to headquarters ginny never even left the burrow how much trouble could she get into even if she did find herself in a sticky situation harry would be there to save her had that girl posing as ginny really been ginny harry would have saved her but what he hadntever considered before was that a polyjuiced ginny wouldntput her in danger it would put everyone else in danger if he hadntrealized in time that it was a trap set up by voldemort he could have led ron to his death tonight so harry lupin said how were you able to tell that it wasntreally ginny it took harry a moment to realize that lupin was talking to him i he said and then felt himself begin to panic he knew that he couldntreveal the true reason he had known because he had used his connection with ginny he and ginny had decided that they werentgoing to tell anyone about this just yet and he did not want to go back on that decision even if it meant having to make up an answer i know ginny he said eventually maybe mr and mrs weasley raised her and maybe ron and everyone else grew up with her but i know her better than any of them i could tell that it wasnther something about that person pretending to be ginny was all wrong something that i cantput my finger on even now and on top of that she was calling for help as he spoke he realized that this was probably what had first caused him to be suspicious of what had been happening you know calling my name calling for me to come and save her and the real ginny would never have done that everything he had said especially the part about knowing ginny better than anyone else had been true but even as he spoke he could not bear to look up and see what sort of expression was on ginny face he had managed to avoid looking at her since their short conversation at the burrow and although he felt certain everyone had noticed that there was something going on with the pair he didntthink anyone would dare bring it up at this moment in time apparently lupin and the others seemed to accept his answer although hermione ever brilliant hermione was giving him a look out of the corner of her eye that told him he d have to answer a few more questions when they all returned to the burrow the meeting gradually switched from the polyjuice incident to other important matters such as moody apparently the auror had suffered rather extensive injuries and had to be taken to st mungo for treatment with an almost unnoticeable quiver in her voice mcgonagall told everyone that moody condition was critical and that the healers all said his chances of recovery did not look very promising after harry spent the entirety of dinner ignoring everyone by remaining silent and not looking up from his plate even once he went up to ginny room and attempted to speak to her he d been a complete arse to her and everyone but she was supposed to forgive him she loved him didntshe and to be honest he was who he was he d never pretended to be anyone other than a miserable bastard shouldntshe have realized what a relationship with him would be like ages ago besides he forgave her every time she did something wrong although really when did she do something wrong he could think of only a handful of times that she had apologized after an argument and had done it because she had been genuinely wrong he found that her door was slightly ajar but he knocked anyway ginny he said can we talk not now she said and harry nearly walked right in because he didnteven think for a moment that ginny would say no she always helped him when he needed her to but gin please just go away it important though i sure it is she told him sounding slightly angered because with you isnteverything important you cantseem to take a breath without the daily prophet wanting to write about it and i thought you realized how ridiculous that is but i guess you don t you re selfish harry today has not been one of your finer ones is it because you re tired we re all tired we re all running on no sleep not just you and yet the rest of us were able to carry out friendly conversation at dinner the rest of us were able to act like human beings you want to talk dontyou think i wanted to talk earlier after we got back from the fight and i tried so hard to get your attention dontyou think i wanted to talk after i found out that i had been polyjuiced and that you and ron had nearly been killed because of it i yeah he said stupidly i guess so so i tired of you being so unavailable unless it suits your own purpose are you are you breaking up with me he asked finally no she said slowly but not so slowly that he had to wonder whether or not she d been seriously considering it but i hacked off at you right now really hacked off and it doesntmean that i dontwant to talk later about what you said before about malfoy and while i realize that that could be the reason you ve been acting so cold today it doesntexplain every other time you shut me out for some stupid reason or another this is a pattern with you one that i really wish you d break if she was waiting for an answer she was going to be sorely disappointed because harry took a step back from the door and then trudged downstairs he knew that she was right that although he d had things on his mind he d still had no reason to treat everyone so poorly but he was still angry with her for saying it he saw ron who was without hermione for the first time all day and although a part of him still wanted to talk about malfoy a larger part of him wanted to sulk he knew that by sulking he was being just as miserable and childish as ginny had accused him of being but he couldnthelp it he didntwant to help it are you all right dear mrs weasley asked she sounded concerned even though he d been acting like a prat to even her today and he felt a wave of guilt hit him square in the chest er yeah he said i just want a little fresh air i ll be outside mrs weasley shook her head do you think it wise to please harry said i ll only be only a few feet from the house i have my wand i just i just need to see something other than four walls closing me in for a little while she relented but watched him through the kitchen window he opened the door after undoing the locks which was rather time consuming actually and stepped outside feeling comfortable finally as the cool air of the night hit him harry was on the grass staring up at the sky he couldntremember the last time he d been outside for a reason other than one directly relating to an order mission the air was cool it was only days away from october and the leaves on the trees were now falling to the ground in reds and yellows his head hurt or maybe his heart and for the very first time since this war began harry potter honestly started to contemplate giving up it was a fleeting thought as ludicrous as a muggle thinking about witches and wizards but it was there what if i just let voldemort win and he had to admit that he was tired of fighting of trying to be the hero of having to protect everyone he cared about they all told him not to act like such a hero all the time but really wasntthat what they all needed from him if he gave up if he stopped playing that role wouldntthey all die when was it going to be someone else turn he looked up at the black sky and tried to count the stars but hardly any were out there was only one that harry could clearly see directly above him bright and twinkling almost as though it was communicating through some sort of morse code hang in there he heard approaching footsteps a moment later ginny lowered herself down onto the grass beside him and then shifted until she was flat on her back they stayed that way for quite some time not speaking but simply looking up at the sky there was a thick silence between them and the air around harry felt charged with something he didntquite comprehend ginny turned her head to look at him her eyes saying i ll forgive you if you forgive me harry felt around for her hand and clasped it in his own as he was beginning to realize he didntalways need to use their connection to understand ginny she squeezed his hand with hers he rolled onto his side and kissed her softly they soon forgot themselves though and ginny used her free hand which was fisting the collar of harry shirt to pull him over on top of her their bodies pressed together a startling fit and harry had to wonder at least for a second or two if it was possible that someone had created them with the another one in mind he lowered his wall and when he felt ginny do the same he communicated his thought with her she laughed into his mouth and began pulling his shirt over his head apparently ignoring his thoughts that they should not allow themselves to get carried away she stopped although they had managed to warm themselves up together it was still rather cool outside and so she allowed him to keep his clothes he attempted to roll away from her but she following the soft weight of her body pressing him to the ground the hand that had been holding hers let go in search of more favourable resting spots the noise coming from the back of ginny throat was enough to make him forget that they were in the middle of her backyard and that if anyone looked out the window they would probably be able to see what was going on outside the sound of hedwig returning from her latest hunt registered in harry mind he knew that someone would open a window to let her in and he also knew that upon doing so that person attention would be drawn to the two figures snogging on the lawn let go inside they pulled away slightly and harry looked up at ginny she really was the most beautiful thing he d ever seen just to the right of her he could make out the same star he d been looking at earlier it was still blinking but in a different pattern this time delivering a new message if hermione had been out there with them she could have told him that the star he was looking at was called sirius dontforget to check out my new one shots scientist and symbiosis disclaimer i dontown harry potter i realize that the last chapter was bound to upset a few people but i think it was somewhat necessary in my opinion hbp when it wasntfocusing on relationships and snogging was all about the fleeting of innocence really in a world where the daily prophet arrives and ron has to ask who dead today what else do you expect i agree that having harry kill someone so soon especially malfoy probably wouldnthappen in the books but i feel i should remind some of you that this isnt one of the books while i canttell you how flattering it is that people compare this little story to jkr writing i can assure you that the way things happen in this fic and the way i hope things happen in the seventh book are two extremely different things remember above all this is still a work of fan fiction i want to keep this story mainly about relationships but it rather difficult to ignore that there is a war going on and harry has many responsibilities i think the question how far is everyone willing to go has many possible answers and these are just mine i not going to make harry some hardcore murderer or anything like that but i at that stage where i cantrealistically continue this without some of the order getting hurt and dying and how fair would it be if harry and co didntget in on the action at least once or twice there will be necessary deaths in here as well as murders and many of them will probably be firsthand from some of our favourite good guys if you dontlike this i really am sorry but i think you should probably find another fic to read chapter thirty eight progress upon hearing that moody was most likely not going to recover hermione allowed herself a moment to feel guilty and then closed her mind to the thought that she could have done something to prevent such a tragic event from taking place any one of the people fighting at the department could have done something she would never feel guilty for choosing ron above all others but she did feel guilty about the other thing she had done had she really even done it she clearly wasntin the right state of mind when she d pulled out her wand and used an unforgivable though if anyone deserved it it was a death eater she was an awful person now wasntshe she d spent her entire life establishing herself she had a perfect spotless record for doing everything right and that was all shot to hell now because she d used one of the worst spells a person could use merlin the ministry should just take her wand and erase her memory so she could go back to being a regular muggle with no knowledge of the magical world or anyone in it she didntdeserve to be a witch magic was such a gift and she d taken it for granted by doing something so awful she shouldntbe allowed to go away with ron and harry to look for horcruxes she shouldntbe allowed to fight in this war she was supposed to be the one to keep ron and harry in line she was supposed to maintain her sanity while everyone else went crazy she was supposed to think rationally and weigh the consequences before each and every one of their actions she was supposed to keep them all alive but it turned out that she sometimes leapt before she stopped and took a look around she could have killed that death eater or worse they could ve ended up like the poor longbottoms how was she supposed to watch over ron and harry when she couldnteven control herself she d once thought that killing another human being no matter what side they were fighting on was the worst thing a person could do and surely it would mean no going back that once someone had committed murder they could never be just a normal person now though she knew differently she suspected that many of the order members possibly even a weasley or two had used the killing curse in the past she also suspected that by the time this war was over harry would be joining that list as well the thought had once frightened her caused her to worry so much that she could hardly think straight let alone meet her best friend eyes now she was forced to wonder if she would end up on the same list was this war making her hard or was she merely starting to realize just how much it would take to win she had to ask herself a very serious question and she had to make an important decision how far was she willing to go she knew the answer before she even thought about it she would go as far as she had to she would do virtually anything even if it meant breaking every rule in the book and totally losing the old hermione in the process and she refused to let herself feel bad about that ron harry whispered into the dark you still awake ron reply was a simple yeah although harry had wanted to speak to ron earlier he had to admit that when he had whispered to ron moments ago he d sort of hoped that ron would have really been asleep can i talk to you for a second it the middle of the night ron said but he didntdirectly protest so harry assumed it was okay to say what was on his mind remember that death eater you told us about amycus er this is why you re keeping me up asked ron it was clear to harry that ron wasntoverly enthusiastic about discussing this but harry really felt he needed to know what had happened yes harry said i need to know i wouldntask if it wasntimportant did you y know kill him yeah ron said well i mean i guess i might have i not sure you re not sure asked harry this wasntthe answer he d expected didntyou use the nah said ron i didntreally i mean i didntuse avada kedavra but i might as well have he was tied up and the house was on fire i knew that if i didntuntie him he d he d die in there but i apparated out without helping him he dead now i think people can consider that murder but what do you consider it ron hesitated a moment i dunno he said i haventreally thought about it harry knew that this was a lie if ron was anything like harry and he was he d obviously thought of nothing else until he d reached a conclusion he could accept ron harry said i fine said ron i reckon it counts as murder what d you think i think harry said that you did what you had to do yeah ron said sounding pleased with this answer yeah i did and i d do it again it was silent for a long time and harry wondered if ron had fallen asleep again he was torn between feeling relieved and disappointed that he would not be able to discuss his dilemma with his best friend tonight why re you asking ron inquired breaking the silence startling harry i oh he said it just that malfoy died at the department of mysteries yeah ron said and harry could tell by his tone that he was waiting for the rest of the story yeah he said i mean i i followed him after the whole ginny thing and i pressed my wand to his neck and i said it avada kedavra i said it i killed him ron bed creaked harry squinted in the darkness and was able to make out ron silhouette sitting up in his bed good ron said harshly you dontthink that i i dunno overreacted i think that malfoy was a bastard a despicable evil little ferret said ron he called hermione a mudblood and made fun of my family and it seemed like his sole purpose in life was to give you a hard time he the reason dumbledore is dead i think that he was the nastiest person i ve ever had the displeasure of meeting and if i were you i would ve done the same thing in a second so if you re asking me all these questions about amycus because you feel guilty about what you did you shouldn t because malfoy would just love to know that you re beating yourself up inside over him harry felt himself smile thanks ron he said and when he closed his eyes he found that this time he was finally able to get to sleep it was a morning near the end of october when charlie began noticing how much he had missed in his absence it was no secret that he had spent the better part of the last ten years living in romania only coming home when he could which was not very often he had missed quite a few important moments in his siblings lives he hadntbeen around to comfort ginny after the chamber of secrets incident and he hadntbeen waiting up all night at grimmauld place with the rest of them when their father had been attacked by the snake he d been in romania when ginny and ron were in the hospital after the department of mysteries as well as when ron had been poisoned on his birthday he was the only one not there at hogwarts the night the death eaters had invaded and bill had been hurt charlie loved his job but he loved his family too and it was fair to say that when he d had to choose between the two he often chose his job sometimes though it wasnthis choice he was a grown man now with a career and a life independent from the burrow and he had certain responsibilities he couldntjust leave and come home at the drop of a hat not even now in the middle of a war he d taken a long leave of absence so he could devote himself to working in romania with the order which had paid off completely because harry and the others had been able to find a horcrux there because of all this though he sometimes felt rather detached from his family he assumed that bill felt this as well and knew that percy who had only just come back to the family must feel this way too in the past few years charlie had only been home a handful of times percy hadntturned out as loyal as hoped and charlie wondered if it would have been different if percy had had the influence of his two eldest brothers at home during his last few years at hogwarts the twins had been different each time he d seen them and if it were possible even more devious than before ron kept getting taller and taller and more in love with hermione every year and ginny if it hadntbeen for the weasley hair charlie wouldnthave even recognized her when he d come home this time as if on cue ginny and hermione came down the stairs and entered the kitchen morning ginny said smiling brightly at him before sitting down on the opposite side of the table an owl arrived with the daily prophet and charlie read it as mrs weasley served breakfast the delicious smell must have been strong enough to reach ron bedroom because ron and harry quickly appeared charlie recognized ginny then because of the look on her face when harry came into sight she looked exactly like the little girl she used to be obsessing over the legend of harry potter he sat down beside her and kissed her cheek whispering something in her ear that charlie didnthear and perhaps he didntwant to hear charlie did not spend as much time with harry potter as the rest of his family did and so he was slightly more objective when it came to harry relationship with ginny his baby sister his only sister he wasntquite sure whether he approved of it or not granted he was aware that he d never think anyone was good enough for ginny and that if anyone was going to make her happy it was harry but he was more realistic than his mum who said that their relationship was harmless and he was apparently more concerned with harry intentions that his father who said that harry was a perfectly respectable young man harry might ve been harmless and respectful in everyday life but he was seventeen clearly arthur had forgotten what it felt like to be seventeen and randy beyond belief charlie hadn t all the good intentions in the world couldntstop harry from being a teenage bloke with a pulse it wasntall that long ago that he had been in harry position after all well as close to harry position as one could get without actually being the boy being hunted down by one of the darkest wizards ever and wasntthat just another reason why harry shouldntbe so closely attached to ginny bloody hell ginny had been captured by death eaters because of her relationship with harry and now this whole prophecy thing it all seemed to spell disaster everyone around the burrow tried to be optimistic and supportive always saying things like when the war is over but nobody ever seemed to stop and realize that this war was not going to be won on hopes and dreams and positive thinking there was a very real chance that many people were going to die that harry was going to die being that charlie wasntas close to harry as everyone else it was easier for him to accept that harry would probably not make it out of this war alive voldemort would be defeated that was something charlie allowed himself to hope for he was willing to pay the ultimate price if it meant the difference between victory and defeat this was something that he knew harry was willing to do as well and though nobody ever spoke of it charlie was fairly sure his family all knew or at least suspected that harry would have to pay this price in a perfect world the harry potters would live but in a perfect world there would be no wars to begin with they were living in dark times and the sooner everyone realized it the better still charlie did not have the heart to tell his sister this what would he say hey sis try not to get too attached to your boyfriend word on the street is that he wontmake it to his eighteenth birthday she would castrate him he loved all of his siblings equally but he had always been most protective of ginny perhaps it was because she was the youngest or maybe even because she was the only girl but whatever the reason he d always taken care of her bill had been gone by the time ginny was at an impressionable age and percy had been too wrapped up in studying to worry about her ron and the twins had never seemed to realize that ginny was their sister and that they should be nice to her because one day they would grow up and want to be closer with her he d stuck up for her with the twins he used to take her for rides on the back of his broom he d been the one to put a bandage on her when she d fallen and scraped her knee and now she was really the only weasley sibling who intimidated the twins and she went for flies alone on her own broom and when she fell she would just stand up and dust herself off she had not just matured mentally either she had always been a cute little kid and now she was a beautiful young woman at the wedding all of the teenage boys on fleur side of the family and disturbingly enough even a few on their own side had stared at ginny with lust in their eyes it was sick to think of his baby sister as sexy and the fact that boys and men looked at her that way made him want to start taking names ginny was chatting away now with fred charlie watched as she picked up a plate of flatcakes and absentmindedly put one on harry plate and harry refilled her now empty glass with pumpkin juice they smiled at each other and charlie marvelled at the way they were so in sync with one another the only two people he d ever seen work that way before were his parents and even that was rare george told an off color joke and through the laughter some of the pumpkin juice harry was drinking dribbled down his front though ginny was turned the other way talking to hermione she picked up a napkin and turned back to harry she leaned closer to him and wiped his shirt and because she was still wearing her summer pajamas she was probably giving him quite the view down her shirt but charlie noticed that harry eyes stayed on her face and what was more the look in his eyes was not that of lust it was love and in some way this bothered charlie more than anything else their relationship wasnt cute or innocent they were in love merlin how had charlie missed it before they were young too young to be feeling the way they obviously did most people probably waited their wholes lives for someone they could find love with and of course his poor sister had to find it right away with harry potter the chosen one the boy who if they were all completely honest with themselves surely everyone knew would not be around in a year he vowed that when this was all over he would be there to pick up the pieces and glue her back together he only hoped that the glue would hold hermione was reading a book on her bed when ron knocked on the door um hey he said she closed her book and waved him in i got kind of bored downstairs i mean i can only annihilate harry at chess so many times hermione smiled he is rather bad at it isnthe even i can beat him now you can that is bad he teased sitting down beside her on her bed i like to give him a hard time about it since when is harry bad at something that almost as foreign as you being bad at something i bad at a lot of things she insisted and harry is too he wasntexactly top of the class at school yeah but school doesntcount honestly ron how we do in life is decided by how well we do in school she lectured i ve been telling you for six years that you cantslack off because you ll regret it later and you never seem to listen to me how do you think her voice died away as ron leaned forward and kissed her he pulled back a moment later and grinned looks like i finally found an off switch for your lecturing he declared now why didnti think of that back in fifth year when you were going totally crazy over studying for owls hermione rolled her eyes because you were too busy being a complete git ah that true he agreed but i cottoned on eventually it sure took you long enough nobody ever said i was smart ron said smiling i think you re smart she insisted no you don t yes i do you re very smart not as smart as you said ron you re a thousand times better than me at chess she said and you re a better fighter hmm am i she nodded i think i like this conversation what else you re also better at quidditch i couldntfly a broom to save my life and you put up with trelawney all those years so you re far more patient than i am which really says something about me considering you arentpatient at all he chuckled then leaned in and kissed her again they were interrupted sometime much later by the sound of ginny exaggerating gagging go away ron said he moved off of hermione when did he end up on top of her and looked at his sister i dontbother you when you snog harry harry and i do not snog with the door wide open nor do we do it in your room ginny said in a singsong voice but since i dontfancy listening to you two all night i ll just be grabbing my pajamas and going upstairs with harry not something i want to think about said ron ginny shrugged innocently and winked at hermione have fun you might want to consider an imperturbable by the way she left closing the door behind her hermione sat up and checked the clock it was just past midnight should i go ron asked softly hermione shook her head i well ginny going to be in your room so where would you stay it doesntmatter he said i could go up to bill room or ron hermione said i want you to stay she fought to contain her smile when she saw him swallow hard i just um i ve been meaning to ask she began wishing she could skip the question but knowing that she d go crazy later if she didntget an answer yeah lavender she said ron sighed i dontmean to bring her up again i just want to know what you did with her what d you mean he asked though she was fairly certain he knew exactly what she meant i know you did more than snog her hermione said but i want to know how much more ron eyes widened i hardly anything he said i mean i i touched her um chest a couple times but nothing else i swear hermione let out a breath she hadntrealized she d been holding that was exactly what she d wanted to hear well maybe she would ve preferred him to say that they hadntdone anything other than snog but she knew that he would be lying and she didntwant that did she besides it wasntas though mclaggen hadnttouched her chest as well though she hadntexactly given him permission to he d sort of just done it at slughorn christmas party she wanted to do other stuff he said awkwardly but i couldn t she she wasnt you hermione beamed then reached for her wand what re you doing with that he asked i going to imperturbable the room like ginny said to she said unless you dont no ron said quickly i definitely do okay then she said and cast the spell brilliant he said it was late at night and charlie was too tired to be bothered to apparate back to his flat in romania as he climbed the stairs to his old bedroom he passed by ginny room and saw a faint blue glow under the doorway he felt his jaw clench why did his sister bedroom need to be imperturbabled she was only sleeping after all he knew realistically what the real reason behind an imperturbable was after all he d used a few in the past but he also knew that his sister had no business needing one there was nothing he could do at the moment he made a mental note to wake up early and wait for her to lower the charm so he could barge in immediately and catch his sister and harry potter red handed as he kept on his way up to his room it occurred to him that ginny shared a room with hermione although he couldntimagine hermione needing an imperturbable he much preferred that to ginny he was well aware of the double standard that existed if it turned out that ron was in there with hermione charlie would probably laugh and forget about it but if it was harry in there with ginny he would go ballistic still he couldntbe bothered to care about how unfair he was but if hermione was with ron that meant that ginny was sleeping somewhere else anyway charlie went up to ron room and saw that the door was closed but the room didntappear to be charmed he went down into his own room and grabbed his invisibility cloak yes harry potter wasntthe only one with that handy little instrument wearing the cloak he went back up to ron room and pushed open the door he found ginny there lying in harry bed with her back pressed against his chest he stepped into the room and shut the door behind him the twinge of annoyance he d felt earlier grew into something larger and he was a second away from waking ginny up sending her to sleep in his bedroom and parking himself in ron bed just to make sure she didnttry to sneak back when harry shifted his arm wrapped around ginny seemingly on instinct and then he opened an eye what re you doing here he asked charlie didntthink ginny would answer as she appeared to be asleep he was surprised when she said ron downstairs with hermione i donteven want to think about all the nasty things they re doing in my bedroom harry laughed you ve got the dirtiest mind out of anyone i know he said how d you know they re not just sleeping like us oh so we re sleeping are we she asked sounding dejected yeah said harry why got a better idea i can think of one or two things ginny charlie baby sister said she shifted backward against him and he groaned your parents are just downstairs he said my parents have never stopped you before no your parents have always stopped me before he said they ve just never stopped you and fuck ginny i only human ginny smirked but said nothing charlie held his breath and tried not to shift too loudly on his feet hoping they would fall asleep soon so he could open the door and sneak out as much as he wanted to pull off the cloak now and throw a huge fit he knew that ginny would make the rest of his life a living hell if he did he had long since missed his chance to make his presence known and if he was discovered now he would be flayed alive for spying but was it really spying if your intentions were honourable though he felt certain he had every right to know all of her personal business charlie knew that his sister would feel differently and she was not someone he wanted to go toe to toe with when angry i think your brother hates me harry said after a moment of total silence my brother there are six you ll have to be a bit more specific than that said ginny yeah harry said charlie he hates me what asked ginny why do you think that dunno haventyou seen the looks he been giving me all week no i haven t she said because i would ve given him hell if i had he he always been really protective of me i guess he just not ready to accept that i not a little girl that none of my big brothers are the most important male in my life anymore hmm you re not scared of charlie are you there are quite a few things that i scared of said harry but charlie isntone of them oh so what are you afraid of i dontknow he said stupidly harry ginny said pointedly this is me you can tell me the truth harry paused for a moment i well i not scared of dying i not he said i know that i well i just i think i okay y know knowing that it going to happen it not going to happen gin shut up she kicked the blankets off of herself and stood up ginny he repeated sitting up behind her and grabbing her wrist softly ginny stopped but didntturn back to him and charlie fought to hold in his sigh of relief if she hadntstopped she would ve plowed right into him and completely given him away that was the least of his concerns at the moment though he was thoroughly interested in where this conversation was going and upon seeing ginny expression he found himself wondering if they hadnthad this conversation before i cant imagine not seeing you everyday i cant i canteven stand the thought of it and you talk about it like you ve already made your peace with it like you arenteven going to try to stay with me hell harry dontyou want to live you dontact like it that not fair he said sharply none of this is fair she said shaking her head you dontthink i know that she closed her eyes tightly i just i just want you to be okay he whispered if i when i gone why are you doing this she sobbed charlie felt his stomach churn while he was glad to know that harry was thinking realistic about everything and trying to get ginny to do the same charlie was going to have to seriously hurt harry for making her cry like this because he ground out if i if it happens you need to be prepared i that what scares me that once this over you ll be drowning and i wontbe around to save you that the only thing i worry about he rested his chin on the top of her head and closed his eyes i refuse to let you go she whispered and he wrapped his arms around her i dontthink it that easy he told her ginny turned back to face him and whispered something that charlie didnthear he saw the way harry features sharpened the way the air around him suddenly seemed so much darker and the person he was looking at wasntharry any longer it was a man who was going to do evil awful things in an attempt to save the world or more aptly to just save ginny his world no longer caring if he was detected just knowing that he needed to get out of there charlie opened the door once he was in the hallway he pulled the invisibility cloak off of him and apparated home to romania everything all right harry lupin asked the next day yeah said harry but he really meant no of course something was wrong why else would he have floo d to headquarters for no reason lupin sat down across from him at the kitchen table you know for a marauder son you can be a terrible liar harry sighed but cracked a smile i just it ginny he admitted did you two have an argument he shook his head no i donteven know last night we oh this isntone of those problems is it lupin asked wearing a large smirk no he said feeling himself blush we were talking about the war and merlin i just really have to figure out a way to keep her away from everything that going to happen why do you need to do that lupin asked because harry said wherever you end up he remembered her whispering just wait for me because i ll follow you anywhere you know said lupin i remember your father having the same problem with your mother harry felt his insides jump at the mention of his parents so what did he do well actually he did nothing said lupin james was smart enough to realize that nothing he could do would stop lily from fighting in the war and so he let her i mean he didnt let her she would have regardless but it was definitely easier on their relationship when he saw reason and stopped fighting her on it yeah he said after a moment and look at how they ended up he shook his head that not going to be ginny it might have to be lupin said softly looking harry in the eye lily lily was a beautiful person a wonderful friend a terrific fighter but your mother had to die for you if she didn t i donteven want to think of what the world would be like right now it two completely different situations harry argued enough people have already died to protect me my parents sirius dumbledore it my fault they re all dead and i cantbe responsible for ginny death too it voldemort fault lupin said fiercely he killed your parents he had his followers kill the others your safety was the most important thing to all of them they chose to die to protect you and i promise you that they re all happy with their choices wherever they are sirius didnthave to die harry said closing his eyes briefly that was my fault you made a mistake everyone makes them most people mistakes dontget other people killed you re not most people lupin said and ginny isn t either she a capable witch harry i know that said harry but she also the number one target because of me if anything ever happened to her i couldnttake that you love her more than anything harry said absolutely unembarrassed why should he feel embarrassed then you ll let her do what she wants it not that simple it is lupin argued i see a lot of your mother in ginny lily was never one to sit on the sidelines while james went out and fought she was always right there with your dad saved his neck more times than i can count and he was okay with that he had to be lupin said lily was fierce that was what james loved most about her lupin sighed you have to understand back then we d always figured that if we died it would be in battle but your parents like so many other order members were hunted down and killed personally by voldemort harry swallowed thickly my point said lupin is that you just never know if you force ginny to stay behind and not fight you re changing her and maybe she ll be alive when this is all over but she wontbe the girl you fell in love with do you really want that i i just want her to live nothing else matters if i could go back and never get involved with her i would if it would keep her safe would you have wanted your father to go back in time and not be with your mother harry paused that different they were only together for a few years but they made the most of it they were happier than most people are throughout their entire lives and if it had been me i wouldnthave wanted to trade that for anything harry sighed and put his head in his hands i hate not knowing how this is going to end i hate that so many people have died and that so many are still going to i wish i could just find these bloody horcruxes already and be done with it now lupin said try not to get your hopes up but we think we might have a lead on another one harry immediately sat up straighter what where who found it do you know which one it is minerva brought dumbledore pensieve here yesterday evening tonks and i spent this morning reviewing the memories he d showed you during your sessions and she thinks that the orphanage might be a location worth checking out that great harry said feeling his mood lighten significantly at the prospect of potentially finding and destroying another horcrux a second thought came crashing down on him though and he felt his stomach sink when he realized that he ron and hermione would need to leave soon in order to destroy this horcrux alone that meant leaving ginny and after the discussion they d had last night he didntthink she would be horribly willing to let him go what is it lupin asked apparently noticing how harry face fell nothing he lied i just remembered that i forgot to do something i should probably be getting back to the burrow lupin nodded they stood from the table um should i tell the weasleys or will there be an order meeting about this asked harry we ll probably hold a meeting in the next few days once tonks and i have been able to find out a little more about the location said lupin but feel free to tell any of the weasleys and hermione of course harry nodded say goodbye and then floo d back to the burrow to tell ron and hermione the news the orphanage ron repeated hermione leaned forward listening intently harry nodded that what lupin said he told them but it a muggle orphanage so any information we d get on it would have to be from muggle books i ll owl my mum and ask her to check the library hermione offered great said harry all i really know is that it was an orphanage in london it was definitely running during the late 1920s and all of the 1930s because that when tom riddle was staying there but how many orphanages in london can there be really only one way to find out ron said with a shrug you think your mum will find what we need surely she ll be able to come up with something said hermione can i borrow hedwig harry nodded and crossed his fingers hoping that mrs granger would be able to find exactly what they needed two days later hedwig returned during breakfast with a large package from mrs granger hermione downplayed it in front of the weasleys saying her mum had probably just sent her a few things from her bedroom at home but her heart was already beating faster as she sat the package on the floor beside her chair it felt heavy enough to contain at least one book and she hoped that her mother had come through and obtained the right information she struggled to eat breakfast at a normal pace wanting nothing more than to devour her meal in three bites and run upstairs where she would wake ron and open the box harry was already training at hogwarts but ron wasntdue to go for another few hours and so she could at least look at the contents of the package with him ron could tell harry all about it as they trained she finished her food slowly and then lingered for a moment more before going upstairs she could tell that ginny sensed something was up but hermione wasntgoing to tell her harry had not told ginny the details yet and as far as she knew he was not going to or perhaps he was planning on telling her just as soon as hermione mum got back to them regardless of his plan hermione knew that ginny wasntgoing to hear a word from her until she could know for sure how much she was allowed to disclose ron she said nudging him awake what d you want he mumbled not opening his eyes get up why i received a package from my mother she said i opening it i just thought you d want to be awake when i did he groaned and sat up okay let have it then she set the box down on his bed and opened it slapping his hand away when he reached for the topmost book hermione grabbed the note that was attached and began to read dear hermione i searched the library for hours but i afraid i couldntfind very many references to a london orphanage operating during the years you listed i managed to find two references that i think best suited your descriptions and this box contains the two separate books that i found them in page 159 paragraph 5 in the first book and page 308 paragraph 16 in the second book i checked the location out on the internet as well i found several newspaper articles on the building and i have attached one of them to the back of this letter i going to suggest taking a look at the article before the books i dontknow what you needed this information for but i sincerely hope that i was of some help to you i have also included 250 pounds in this package hermione i dontknow what you re about to do but i willing to bet that it is going to be dangerous please be safe your father and i love you very very much give our best to ron harry and the rest of the weasleys all my love mum well asked ron hermione turned the letter over and gasped as she took in the title of the newspaper article what that ron asked moving closer and reading it for himself an article my mum found about the orphanage about the orphanage he repeated but shite this says it burned down yes hermione said softly and look at the date of the article 1945 ron read aloud he looked up and their eyes met so so said hermione we ve just found our horcrux location please forgive my terrible lateness i ve been in a horrible mood lately for reasons i will not bore you with and every time i sat down to write this chapter it ended with harry dying and when i would give myself a shake and try again ginny was the one dying since neither was incredibly convenient for this chapter i decided to put the writing on hold for a while review and dontforget to check out my newest one shot left behind disclaimer i dontown harry potter i have serious love for all my readers from those who have been reading since day one to those who just started today but this chapter is dedicated to those who have been reading from day one today just going with it is officially one year old well it actually just past midnight now so i suppose i should say yesterday either way i just want to give a huge thank you to everyone who has spent a year of their life following this story the response i ve gotten with this single story has been huge overwhelming and one hundred percent unexpected chapter thirty nine the departure huh ron asked dontyou get it said hermione um does it look like i have any bloody clue what you re talking about hermione sighed then furrowed her brow i mean i might be totally off the mark here but the dates do match up would you just tell me already hepzibah smith she said remember harry told us about her dumbledore showed him the memory from her house elf she was the old bird with the hufflepuff cup right hermione rolled her eyes yes the old bird she said dryly that her he grinned what about her if i remember correctly and you probably do ron said under his breath voldemort visited her when he was fresh out of hogwarts working at borgin and burkes she showed him the cup and the locket and then a couple days later she ended up dead and both objects had gone missing hermione recalled she looked at ron expectantly er i remember that but what does that have to do with the orphanage voldemort was right out of hogwarts when he killed her eighteen a little older maybe um okay hermione sighed exasperated voldemort was born in 1926 go ahead eighteen years ron looked at her that math i cantdo he said simply she rolled her eyes honestly the year is 1944 she told him the orphanage burned down in 1945 the article says that it was ruled as arson but nobody was ever caught and reprimanded something in ron head finally clicked so he said slowly hoping he d finally figured out what she was saying you think that voldemort killed hepzibah stole the cup and the locket and then a little while later he burned down the orphanage and left the cup there that what i think hermione concluded voldemort understandably hated growing up there he had no family and harry even said that the women running the orphanage thought he was odd they all probably treated him like a freak i think he sent the place up in flames as revenge and then because he felt so powerful and so terrific he left one of his horcruxes there in the ruins wouldntone of the muggles have found it ron speculated i mean it not as though he put any muggle repelling charms on the area there were articles written about it and the fire was investigated people probably searched through the ruins night and day hermione appeared to consider this there are spells to make magical objects completely invisible to muggles she said eventually sort of like the way grimmauld place would be invisible to anyone who didntknow it was there i really hope you re right ron said i think i am she said confidently the coincidence is just too great the years match up almost perfectly and the fact that the orphanage was burned down voldemort never would ve left a horcrux there just because it was an important part of his life it was a bad part of his life but by burning it down maybe even killing a few people inside i bet he felt like he accomplished something great ron shrugged if harry agrees with you and it you so why wouldnthe we ll probably leave tomorrow maybe even tonight are you oh she said i just thought what if something else has been build overtop of the ruins maybe we ll get lucky maybe it in a ruddy neighbourhood and nobody wanted to build something there he said or maybe voldemort put another sort of spell around it keeping that sort of stuff from happening hermione pulled out the books and began flipping through the pages once she had read both paragraphs she pulled out the 250 pounds her mother had included and smiled this ll help us out a lot she said since we cantrisk staying anywhere in the magical world we ll need muggle money so we can stay in a motel or an inn and we cantgo to gringotts to change our money into muggle pounds if you add in the amount of muggle money i ve got up in my trunk we should be able to get by for a week maybe even more well said ron i sure hope it wonttake us that long hermione nodded absentmindedly we need to be prepared for the worst the worst ron said is not running out of money the worst is if a hundred death eaters are there waiting for us it a possibility hermione said after all with snape on their side voldemort must know that we re hunting down and destroying the horcruxes i wouldntbe surprised if he got a thousand death eaters waiting for us ron gulped you think he even got a thousand death eaters hermione bit her lip no she said not even close i bet but i sure that even if he only got ten stationed there to fight us that enough to get us in some serious trouble what said ron lightly you dontthink the three of us can take on ten death eaters of course we can hermione said but she didntsound horribly confident we leave tuesday morning harry said he ron and hermione were up in ron bedroom and he d just looked at everything hermione mum had provided before the sun comes up but we should leave tomorrow hermione said we re as prepared now as we ll ever be and the sooner we leave the sooner we can get to work there an order meeting tomorrow said ron tonks told us today during training it ll be about the progress they re making added harry hermione expression told him that she didntthink waiting that long was a good idea and harry agreed completely but his desire to go out and destroy another horcrux did not keep him from realizing how important it was to be properly prepared i d much rather go tomorrow but we need to hear what they have to say if they ve come up with something we need to know hermione sighed then nodded so we ll attend the meeting tomorrow night come home wait for everyone to go to bed and then leave without telling anyone harry nodded ron and hermione looked at him expectantly what he got the feeling that he was forgetting something but what okay what he asked ginny they said together well obviously he said but felt his stomach sink truthfully she hadnteven entered his mind he was so focused on the horcruxes that he hadnteven considered her he didntknow how long they were going to be gone what would ginny say what would she do mrs weasley yelled that dinner was ready and harry mercifully was saved from further speech he didntreally know what to say anyway he trudged downstairs his mind entertaining several different scenarios of how his talk with ginny would go he didntget very far though every scene ended with them snogging and he somehow didntthink that this was a horribly accurate prediction he sat beside ginny at dinner acting as if nothing was out of the ordinary his heart was beating faster than usual and he realized with no great amount of surprise that he was actually afraid of ginny the tiny witch beside him who just barely came up to his chin but she had proven time and time again that size was not a factor when it came to her and anyway he wasnttoo concerned that she would turn abusive when he told her his plans he expected her to hit him of course however he didntexpect it to hurt very much he just didntwant her to look at him like that the way she always did when he did something she didntwant him to do breaking up with her going off to fight without her he knew that she would want him to include her he knew that she would insist on going with him that couldnthappen and not because he didntwant her in danger though that was part of it she would need to stay behind and keep the order at bay harry was not foolish enough to think that mrs weasley wouldnttry to track them down lupin would figure out where they d gone in a matter of minutes if any of the order members followed them and blew their cover it could spell disaster for everyone involved ginny would have to what distract them divert them do something anything certainly she would be able to come up with something she wasnta weasley for nothing after all by the time dinner was finished harry was seriously considering putting off his discussion with ginny if she hadntgrabbed him put the shirt and pulled him into her room he probably would have waited until the following day to tell her anything okay ginny said shutting the door firmly behind her what going on what d you mean harry asked then knew it was the wrong thing to do playing the fool would not go over well she narrowed her eyes at him but before she could speak he cut in i leaving tuesday morning he blurted with ron and hermione where she whispered muggle london we think we might ve found another horcrux she stared at him for a moment as if trying to comprehend all of this you re sure she asked finally he nodded there going to be an order meeting about it tomorrow lupin told me about it a few days ago and hermione researched it of course she did ginny said lupin and tonks think the orphanage where voldemort grew up might be a location he continued and it worth checking out so instead of waiting a few days and going with the order you three idiots are going to run off on your own and get yourselves killed she snapped ginny he said voldemort knows we re onto him snape told him i know he did so we cantafford to waste any time waiting a few days could mean going into the final battle with only five horcruxes destroyed ginny covered her face with her hands and then ran them through her hair there no way you re letting me come with you is there she asked no he said softly but firmly i i need you here safe i coming with you next time she said fiercely a determined look on her face and i refuse to take no for an answer harry you need me i know you do and you know it too harry closed his eyes trying to fight against the portion of his brain that was agreeing with her i i not making any promises he said but i ll think about it she did not seem satisfied with his answer but instead of arguing she reached out and pulled him in for a hard bruising kiss when they pulled away both breathing heavily he said i dontget it you never do she said but not angrily and then kissed him again he decided that although he knew they would fight about this entire situation later he rather liked the idea of just snogging for now hermione nearly jumped out of her skin when harry suddenly unexpectedly apparated into the middle of ron bedroom everything all right she asked harry just blushed and turned his back to her the sound of a zipper cut through the air and hermione fought to hide her smirk oh harry she said yeah she bit her lip i think your shirt is on inside out he hung his head then laughed i suppose you caught me he muttered what happened he turned back around to face her and then grinned embarrassed er charlie started knocking on ginny door and we were lovely she said holding out her hand to stop his story she really really didntneed to hear the rest of his sentence she dropped her gaze to the floor as he pulled off his shirt and turned it the right way before putting it back on she found this funny yet embarrassing and was thankful that ron wasntin the room do i even want to know ron said appearing at the door why the two of you are in here alone with the door closed or why harry was half naked a second ago probably not teased hermione because you d kill harry and then my fun would be over oh you re just hilarious said ron he looked to harry and then started laughing what now harry asked impatiently hermione couldntfigure out what ron was laughing at nice love bite ron said flopping down onto his bed harry hand shot up to his neck and hermione noticed the red mark there like that do you you should see your sister ron shrugged is it supposed to bother me if she got a love bite on her neck who said it was anywhere near her neck harry asked so seriously that hermione knew it was trouble even if harry was only joking ron jaw squared and he sat up okay she said before anything could happen if you two cantplay nicely i going to have to separate you whatever said ron harry shrugged and sat down on his own bed so how did it go with ginny she was um said harry her reaction was intense i sure she ll get over it ron said harry looked at hermione and said we ll have to do something about your hair she was momentarily taken aback excuse me she said what was he talking about when we leave you ll have to be the one to rent us a room i rubbish at changing my appearance and if i just went as myself i too memorable whoever checks us in wontforget the bloke with the lightning bolt scar on his forehead ron too tall freckles it just stands out in someone mind we cantafford to be tracked down if you can use some kind of glamour charm to make your hair not as big you wontbe too memorable she didntknow if that was an insult or not but she decided it didntmatter he was right after all i ll see what i can come up with she said i ll ask ginny for help i can change my appearance said ron i did it all the time when i was er when i was away so if you need me to i can check in and you two can follow under the invisibility cloak will we both fit under there asked harry ron shrugged we ll just have to figure out a way to fit he said or we ll need to come up with another way to sneak off without being seen hermione paced around the room no matter how well prepared they were something was going to happen that would change their plans it was impossible for them to anticipate every possible situation and so there was room for error they could be taken by surprise and if they were it could mean serious trouble for all three of them though she tried she couldntseem to shake the overwhelming feeling that only two of them would be coming back from this trip ron sucked in a breath as harry apparated into his bedroom did you say goodbye to ginny he whispered harry nodded solemnly yeah he said we re all set to leave yes hermione answered quietly ron shivered they were leaving and who knew when they would be back if they would be back got the cloak harry nodded producing the invisibility cloak from behind his back got the money hermione pulled out an envelope stuffed with muggle pounds some from her mother and some that she had saved up on her own got the note ron held up a piece of paper on which he had written a note to his mum telling her not to worry and not to try and follow them even though the trio knew that molly would do both anyway let get out of here hermione reached out and clasped ron hand in her left and harry in her right we re going to be all right she said hopefully if one of us is separated from the other two harry began his voice shaking the other two have to get out safely ron went to protest but harry looked at him so earnestly that he faltered promise he said harry hermione said promise he repeated defeated hermione said promise ron nodded and agreed as well but when harry turned his back he and hermione shared a look and they both knew without a doubt that neither of them would ever leave harry behind they didntall fit under the cloak anymore so they settled for holding their breaths as they snuck out of ron room and down the stairs praying that nobody would wake up and discover them they made it down to the kitchen and out the door without difficulty and as the cool night air kissed their skin ron realized that this was it once they left they would not be coming home until they had a horcrux with them he wondered how long it would take and he wondered what sort of state everyone would be in when they returned goodbye he thought hoping that it was only temporary but knowing that he would sacrifice anything even his life for the two people at his sides be safe along with reviews i asking that everyone says a prayer for my friend who in a coma it would be greatly appreciated and for those of you who cantmulti task just do the prayer god bless disclaimer i dontown anything thanks so much for the feedback i love you all chapter four the new member would it be okay if i borrowed pig for a while i need to send a letter hermione explained ron didntlook up from the chessboard he and harry were currently playing on sure whatever if it to neville or luna tell them hello for me ginny said from her spot on the floor where she was half reading her book and half watching the chess game for me too said harry ron attempted to block them out trying his hardest not to come out of his own little world and lose his focus looking at hermione is exactly the type of thing that could cause that it had been three days since their kiss and neither of them had brought it up yet he doubted that they ever would it neither of them actually she admitted but i ll still put it in if you d like ron glanced up at her and saw the hint of a smile tugging at her full luscious lips shit he had no hope of focusing on chess now not after seeing that skirt she was wearing blimey when had hermione gotten such a good body he noticed over the years that certain things had developed but he never remembered her looking like that who re you writing to he asked curiously she blushed ron thought she looked exceptionally stunning when she was embarrassed nobody forget i said anything i can use pig though yeah before getting a definite answer she turned around and scurried out of the room he and harry exchanged confused looks before harry nodded ron got up from his chair telling ginny she could finish up the game for him and followed hermione hermione he called she was instructing pig who was flapping around enthusiastically on where to bring the letter and chose to ignore him hermione he yelled again she opened the window and let the hyper owl flew away yes ron what do you need she asked you didntanswer me who re you writing to she looked away averting his eyes i told you it nobody she shrugged after a few minutes of silence hermione sensing that he wasntgoing to leave her alone until she confessed said dontget mad okay i was writing to viktor what viktor krum why bellowed ron hermione glare at him her anger level rising for your information ronald weasley i can write to whoever i want whenever i want for whatever reason she said angrily not krum you can t what do you see in that git anyway questioned ron he isnta git he very polite and respectful which is more than i can say for you she snapped and i dont see anything in him he and i are just friends how many times do i have to tell you that you sure werent just friends with vicky when you snogged him though were you ron argued hermione eyes narrowed first of all his name isnt vicky it viktor secondly he snogged me and i only let him because i was absolutely furious with you at the time she stated indifferently and you re one to talk heard from lavender since school been out she asked tauntingly ron blushed and broke eye contact um er no he stammered he didntwant to admit that she d sent him almost half a dozen letters to which he had no reply her features twisted into an expression of irritation and nervousness dontlie she said quietly i dontcare if you ve been owling her are you two back together she tried to make it sound like question but ron thought it sounded more like an accusation merlin no ron exclaimed she sent me a few letters but i havent i haventanswered her he said why not that terrible ron even if it is lavender he couldnthelp but laugh at her pseudo outrage get some parchment and write her back this instant she ordered ron felt himself getting angry again not at hermione for bossing him around because he was used to that he was remembering the things his ex girlfriend had written in her letters and all the vicious things she had said about hermione he shook his head furiously i wouldntwrite that girl back for all the gold in gringotts ron that isntfair you might not want to get back together with her but you should at least reply to her letters and say hello insisted hermione he shook his head adamant about that particular matter look i know she can be a little hard to take at times hermione began ron rolled his eyes alright alright she was down right annoying in fact if i heard her say won won once more i might have hit her but in any case you still dated her so you owe her the follow up courtesies no why not you can be so stubborn sometimes you know that just write her back i said no i refuse to ever communicate with her again until she apologizes for the nasty things she said about you hermione looked shocked what kind of things dontmake me get into this ron silently pleaded with her he didnthave the heart to tell her all the spiteful things lavender had written he still felt bad for their first year when he had called her a nightmare and caused her to hide in the bathroom and cry how terrible would he feel now about this bad things he said and then he continued she had the nerve to hint around about the wedding trying to get me to ask her to be my date hermione scowled goodness no i think i might strangle that cow myself if she were here for a few days you said no right she asked nervously i didnteven answer her but i would ve said no when i didntanswer her third letter she went off on me about you again insisting that the only reason i wasntwriting her was because you werentletting me he explained she seems to think i ve replaced her with you and that we re having some sort of sordid love affair hermione laughed out loud she clearly out of her own head write her tell her there nothing going on with us and maybe she ll calm down a bit hermione suggested no said ron shaking his head again i sorry i can put up with a lot from her but i not going to let her say those things about you he looked around checking to make sure nobody was listening and whispered she called you a scarlet woman lavender said that isntshe the girl who practically shagged you in the middle of the common room every night hermione asked bitterly ron flushed and looked down at his feet hey i never said she was right he defended himself of course you didn t i sorry she apologized i think it really sweet that you got so defensive over me but i dontwant to ruin your relationship she just jealous wouldntyou be if she was spending the whole summer with another boy no ron insisted i wouldntbe because we arenttogether she isntthe one i want to he stopped and inhaled sharply i mean i dontcare if she jealous or not because it over between us this isntsolely because of you you know i know hermione said softly ron chewed his lip debating whether or not it was a good time to ask her they had just finished rowing true but they had also cooled down and were on good terms again he figured he might as well go for it er hermione i er i was thinking since we never got to go to the whole christmas party thing with the slug club maybe we could well if you want to that is maybe we could uh ron she said quietly almost so quietly that he barely heard her he looked up from the carpet and his eyes met hers if you re asking me the answer is yes but you d better do it soon before i reconsider she teased i sure viktor would love to come d you want to go to the wedding with me he blurted out quickly before she could finish her thought about vicky love to she smiled ron grinned back at her he thought about what she had said about writing lavender and got a devilish idea maybe i will write lavender back he said as they walked back to the drawing room where he had left harry and ginny and i ll be sure to tell her all about the fun you and i are going to have at the wedding harry was having a hard time concentrating on chess firstly there was the matter of his two best friends who were clearly oblivious to the other feelings harry used to be concerned that ron and hermione getting together would make him the third wheel but he had thought about it quite a lot lately and he had grown accustomed to the idea of his friends finding happiness in each other if something did happen to harry during the battle with voldemort he at least wanted them to have each other secondly he was sitting a mere foot away from ginny who smelt heavenly every time he took a breath in his nostrils filled with her scent was it perfume or was it natural his head was spinning when he felt something lightly brush against his leg at first he assumed it was crookshanks but after a while it moved under his trousers and further up his shin he glanced up at ginny who was smiling deviously at him he raised his eyebrows but she continued to move her foot higher up his leg he cleared his throat gin they re going to be back any minute now harry warned as if on cue the sounds of ron and hermione shouts filled their ears ginny got up off her chair and crept out of the room returning seconds later with a soft smile on her face viktor krum and lavender she reported we ve got loads of time before they finish rowing she sat down on his lap and kissed him her tongue immediately probing his mouth sometimes harry hated growing up it meant having to deal with change having to mature and face tougher obstacles that before it meant the death of loves ones and even the closing of hogwarts it meant the end was near and the final battle with voldemort was even nearer but other times like now harry loved it when he was little for some strange reason he didntthink snogging girls was appealing and now around ginny it was all he could think about in the previous summers spent at the burrow the house was filled with people you couldntget a moment of peace or time to yourself now bill was about to have a wife charlie was as absent as ever percy was gone fred and george had their own flat and mr weasley was working more and more that left harry ginny hermione and ron and mrs weasley of course alone to do whatever they pleased when they broke apart harry rested his forehead against ginny and said you know i beginning to think you like the idea of being caught i ve always enjoyed the thrill that goes along with sneaking around she laughed why d you think i used to steal my brothers brooms when i was little it wasntbecause i dreamed of the day i could join the quidditch team at hogwarts harry laughed and kissed her again moments later harry thought he heard footsteps approaching ginny flew off of him and sat back down in her own chair hastily ordering the move of a chess piece just as ron and hermione entered the room chuckling so harry your birthday is soon said hermione as she and ron re entered the drawing room yep he said smiling at ginny as the chess piece she moved was smashed by one of his what d you want to do for it asked ron nothing he answered i dontwant to make a big deal of it harry you ll be seventeen it is a big deal ginny exclaimed dontyou want to have a big party with all our friends or anything no i dontwant to impose on your family harry said besides whose parents would allow them to come ron shrugged and sprawled out on the floor okay but we re still going to celebrate insisted ginny it ll be fun just the four of us well what about everything sirius left you are you going to stay at grimmauld place hermione inquired she didntparticularly enjoy the thought of harry living alone in his godfather old house harry shook his head no i told dumbledore last year that the order could keep using it as their headquarters if they wanted because i didntwant it speaking of the order what will they do now that dumbledore gone asked ron wasnthe their secret keeper hermione nodded yes he was i suppose they ll have to get someone else now but who ginny asked minerva is the new secret keeper mrs weasley said entering the room professor mcgonagall harry asked brilliant hermione beamed professor mcgonagall was a very valuable member of the order hermione was sure she would be excellent as the secret keeper yes i thought so as well anyway harry professor mcgonagall is downstairs she wishes to speak with you about mrs weasley looked around at her children and hermione uneasily and lowered her voice order business hello potter sit down professor mcgonagall said when harry went down into the kitchen he pulled out a chair and sat down at the kitchen table professor mcgonagall remained standing looking down at him i sure molly has informed you that i am the new secret keeper for the order of the phoenix yes she did professor answered harry excellent excellent since you re the new owner of number twelve grimmauld place i already told professor dumbledore that the order could still using it as headquarters i here requesting permission to continue using it said professor mcgonagall completely ignoring harry interjection i perfectly aware that of what you told professor dumbledore but as newly instated secret keeper i felt it my duty to ask you again oh er thanks you can use it mumbled harry mcgonagall took a seat beside harry at the table there is one other matter that i wish to discuss with you she said quietly you re going to be of age in a few days time is that correct yeah three days said harry and i sure you re aware that hogwarts will most likely not be re opening its doors any time soon yes professor yes well that is why i really here you see we the order would like you to become a full fledged member announced mcgonagall what harry gaped at her as in join the order that exactly what i mean yes said mcgonagall but of course you wontbe any ordinary member you will have numerous aurors at your disposable for your missions you mean the horcruxes harry blurted out mcgonagall nodded i had a conversation with albus portrait recently and he told me what you two had been doing that night she said sadly i imagine that you plan on continuing harry nodded i cannot let you do it alone i wontbe alone insisted harry i ll have ron and hermione with me mcgonagall stared studying him harry was sure that she was about to forbid him from bringing his friends into this like she had done several times in the past and while the three of you are incredibly talented and have survived countless obstacles in the past she began i trust that you would appreciate the extra backup yes we would very much harry didntknow what to say mcgonagall usually attempted to talk him out of fighting and being where the action was and now she was not only giving him her permission but she was offering reinforcements this is not an easy subject to approach potter but it is in regard to lord voldemort harry nodded urging her to continue you are not a child anymore i daresay you are a man a wizard and a great one at that surely you realize that the final battle is approaching and it is only a matter of time now i know professor when the time comes you will be in charge she stated harry stared at her as if she had three heads you will give the orders and have complete control of the missions harry sat there trying to process all of the new information he was receiving at an alarming rate he was joining the order andhe was going to be in charge wow um thank you this is a lot of responsibility i know but dontlet it go to your head i trust albus dumbledore wholeheartedly and he held a great deal of confidence on you i counting on you do not screw this up thanks for the vote of confidence thought harry i won t said harry mcgonagall stood up very well i must be off but tell molly that the next order meeting will be on the thirty first of july will i be attending harry asked heavens no barked mcgonagall she leaned in close to harry that is your birthday a day that may very well be your last day of freedom be with your friends have a childhood for once in your life thank you um will i be able to attend the meetings after that inquired harry mcgonagall nodded and said yes yes of course in fact it would be most suitable if you were to come to grimmauld place straight away the next morning so one of the members could bring you up to speed she put on her traveling cloak and went to leave professor harry called as she made to walk out the door she turned to face him would it er is it okay if i told ron hermione and ginny if i told you no would you truly keep the information from then anyway mcgonagall smiled go ahead potter if they are to play important parts in the missions you will be organizing as i suspect that they will they should be properly informed right thank you goodbye harry lingered in the kitchen for a moment before climbing the stairs back to the drawing room ron hermione ginny and mrs weasley were all in various spots around the room waiting for him well hermione said anxiously mum says there a new member to the order who is it asked ginny harry looked at mrs weasley who winked and nodded it it me hermione and ginny gasped while ron yelled bloody hell earning a glance from mrs weasley everyone stared at him in shock well what d you think asked harry ron grinned blimey harry you re going to be in the order review disclaimer i dontown harry potter i could say this chapter took me a long time to write but that would be a pretty disgusting lie once i had the idea it took about five hours that probably an exaggeration actually but i not even going to explain myself because i ve come to that awful place where it doesntmatter there way too much going on right now for me to let myself worry about updating all the time but all of you selfish readers out there can relax and you can stop sending me emails too because we both know i just send nasty replies i not quitting this story for ashleigh my favourite person ever who died without waking on the twenty third and for eddie who died late wednesday night rest in peace chapter forty complications it was raining of course and hermione fretted for ten minutes wondering aloud why she hadntthought to bring an umbrella a little rain never hurt anyone ron said though it didntlook like ron at all he now had a smaller nose black hair and no freckles in sight harry marvelled at the change saying he looked like a complete git and subsequently about a thousand times better than usual hermione smacked his arm or what she thought was his arm given that he was under the invisibility cloak and insisted that she liked him exactly the way he was and that harry was merely joking i sure a little rain has never done anyone any harm hermione agreed but this is a lot of rain and i dontthink all of the straightening spells i applied to my hair will hold if this keeps up she quickened her pace a bit forcing the other two to speed up how many rooms are we getting asked harry he didntthink hermione would much enjoy having to share a room with the two of them or he didntthink he d enjoy having to bunk in with them that directly dependent on how many we can afford answered hermione she paused and looked around do you really know where we re going sure i do said ron when hermione nodded and resumed walked he looked in harry direction and shrugged as if to say i donthave a bloody clue in hell where we are harry smiled to himself under the cloak his friend really was a piece of work that looks like a hotel over there hermione said pointing to a place harry couldntquite see due to his poor vision see said ron i told you i knew where we were going hermione rolled her eyes and squealed when ron jumped in a puddle spraying her with water ron she scolded ron smiled innocently c mon he said stop making a scene we arentsupposed to draw unwanted attention remember he asked repeating the words she d used when lecturing him earlier honestly she said shaking her head at him harry and i should have left you back at the burrow did you hear that one mate said harry i think your girl making a pass at me keep a close eye or she might try to leave you and take up with me nah ron disagreed why would she want to trade down like that harry shoved him lightly and ron took a pretend swing earning him several strange looks from the muggles who thought he was punching air rather than an invisible harry okay hermione said strictly sounding much like a mother speaking to an over active child they stopped outside the front entrance to a small muggle building that harry assumed was a slightly run down hotel ron just stand there and try not to look too amazed by every little muggle contraption you see dontspeak unless directly spoken to why not he asked and honestly harry thought he was only asking this to drive hermione mad because you ll give us away she hissed just remember under no circumstances are you to do anything other than what we ve already agreed on yeah yeah said ron tiredly i heard you the first four times hermione appeared to be restraining herself though not without a great deal of effort from wringing his neck let go harry said holding the cloak very tightly around himself for it wouldntdo well for him to lose hold of it and randomly appear in the middle of a room full of muggles he followed ron and hermione through the doors a petite woman with a too pleasant to be genuine smile plastered on her face regarded ron and hermione from her place behind the front desk her nametag caught one of the florescent lights hanging above her and sparkled reminding harry greatly of percy and his polished head boy badge good morning the woman kate said what can i do for you this morning hello said hermione in a voice far more upbeat than one she ever used when speaking to either harry or ron we d like to rent a room she clasped ron hands and added for good measure we re on our honeymoon we first thought to go somewhere like italy but then harry wondered if hermione realized that only liars gave away heaps and heaps of useless information the way she was rambling on he seriously doubted it do you have a reservation kate cut in harry watched as hermione smile fell um no actually she said lamely harry could tell that kate was rather puzzled you didntthink to make a reservation i um we eloped said ron jumping in and doing exactly what hermione had instructed him not to do decided that a big extravagant wedding wasntour style hermione took a moment to process what he d said right exactly we re not very fancy people she said obviously harry thought looking at the cracking wall behind kate head and then down to the unusual stain on the floor just to the right of his feet why else would anyone want to stay here for their honeymoon kate smile returned full force that wonderful she said congratulations give me a moment and i ll go see what i can do wonderful said hermione who appeared to regain her bearings i just remembered something ron said quietly after kate had left her post and disappeared into the back room what that asked hermione you he said speaking in hushed tones are a terrible liar hermione frowned but didntbother trying to deny it kate returned her fake smile still stuck on her face i very sorry she said but it seems that we re all filled up for tonight harry wondered if this was true how many people could possibly want to stay here at one single point in time then again judging by the apparent size of the building from the outside he didntthink there were very many available rooms to begin with oh dear said hermione the trio had not planned on this in the least biting his lip harry waved his hand under the cloak the telephone began to ring causing ron to jump slightly and look around wildly hermione elbowed him in the side and glared at him kate smiled apologetically at ron and hermione then turned away from them and answered the phone using a greeting with which she sounded horribly practiced ron and hermione exchanged confused looks and harry wondered how long it would take before they realized that he d had a hand in this sudden phone call you re in luck kate said brightly after hanging up the phone and turning back to them one of our guests just called and cancelled their reservations we ve got a room available though it isntthe deluxe suite we usually have to offer couples on their honeymoon if you had phoned ahead we ll take it hermione said quickly how much it fifty three pounds a night replied kate she turned to her computer and began typing away how many nights will you be staying the cancelled reservation was for three days so that really all i can offer you at this time unless something else turns up they exchanged looks er said ron three days sounds all right excellent you ll be paying at the end of your stay so all i need is your name and fisher said hermione parker and charlotte apparently parker and charlotte fisher were a couple who had once lived a few blocks over from hermione when she was younger kate nodded robotically and put this into the computer she then looked up stared at them for a moment and got a funny expression on her face the jig is up harry thought instantly she leaned over the counter and raised her eyebrows haventyou any luggage we thought we d just buy whatever we needed said ron after a moment it was probably too long of a pause but if kate thought this she didntlet on i never pack the right stuff anyway in truth hermione was carrying a purse holding all of their shrunken possessions it awful really added hermione you wouldntbelieve what he considers necessities ridiculous there a shopping mall just down the way said kate since check in isntuntil noon perhaps you could busy yourselves there if you re not familiar enough with the area to go out hermione nodded great we ve got a few things in particular i suppose we ll need to get while we re here well said kate i hope you find everything you re looking for here in london hermione smiled tightly yes i quite sure we will ginny knew by the sound of her mum screams that the note had been found everyone yelled mrs weasley downstairs now they re gone sighing and preparing herself for one hell of a morning ginny pulled on some clothes and made her way downstairs it wasntas if she d been sleeping anyway how could she possibly sleep she d spent the past three hours sitting in the middle of her room in pitch blackness doing nothing but leaving her mind wide open just incase harry wanted to make an appearance he hadn t she didntdare let herself wonder what horrible thing could have happened that would prevent him from communicating with her that bloody git was probably alive and well and living it up with ron and hermione wanker the first thought ginny had upon seeing her mum was she looks terrible and it was true never not ever had mrs weasley looked as old as she did in this moment ginny felt a pang of guilt they all put her through so much and it really wasntgoing to end anytime soon was it she was forced to wonder though not for the first time just how much pain and grief ginny and her brothers would cause their mother during this war whether directly or indirectly ginny sobbed her mum ron is gone and so are harry and hermione yeah said ginny calmly though not one inch of her felt anything less than completely panicked when harry was mentioned she didntneed a reminder that he wasntsafe at home she knew bloody well enough that he was in as much danger now as he d ever been in before i know it was amazing truly amazing how fast her mum could switch from hysterical to furious you know ginny charlie began she noticed for the first time since coming down into the kitchen that he and bill were also present where are they i dontknow said ginny and bugger when did she become a worse liar than bloody hermione it sure sounds like you do said bill fine ginny corrected she looked at her brothers refusing to let herself glance back over at her mum if she had to see the tortured look her mum face held for another second she d spill everything i do know but i not telling you most certainly are her mum snapped tell me where my son has gone i can t ginny said resolutely harry had warned her that her mum would try to exercise any possible authority she could muster and that if it came down to it she would resort to mercilessly bullying ginny into telling the truth ginny thought she d prepared herself for any possible confrontation after all she d always been brilliant when dealing with confrontation she had to be she was a weasley how else would she survive in her own house if she couldntgo head to head with the best of them this is not the time for games ginevra i know that said ginny mum listen they re gone and there nothing any of us can do now you think that if i had a say i d be hanging around here hell no i d have gone ginevra do not stand here and tell me that you would have gone with those three ginny shrugged all right then i ll lie i have no ambition to ever join this fight i well aware that there a huge war going on out there but i have absolutely no intention of getting involved so what if my whole family going to be putting their arses on the line and harry goodness no i couldntcare less about his role in this i really just happy to sit in the shadows and twiddle my thumbs like a good little girl lock me up and come collect me when the big bad men are all gone would you her mum slapped her across the face then and her brothers gaped molly weasley had never hesitated when it came to yelling and screaming and punishing her children but she had never raised a hand at any of them no matter what they d done but ginny was unfazed i joining this fight mum she said i doing it whether you like it or not i not a little girl anymore you cantmake all my decisions anymore you dontget to call the shots and just expect me to then who does call the shots ginny interrupted charlie it clearly not you you said yourself that if you had a say in it you d have left with the others who in charge then harry he the boss of you now is he that enough yelled ginny what is your fucking problem her mum didnteven scold her for her filthy language or perhaps she did but ginny did not hear her either way i just saying said charlie calmly the fact that he was trying to keep his temper in check so he could come off as being the bigger person made her blood boil even more it seems to me that harry starting to show his true colours that one has you trained awfully well yeah charlie said this very matter of factly and in that moment ginny hated him and not a little bit either she hated him very much so much in fact that for a split second she wished him to go away and never return she hated his smug face his over protectiveness his utter inability to realize and accept that although he had never felt all the feelings ginny experienced with harry those feelings were real she didnteven realize that she d drawn her wand nor did she realize that she was now holding it out and training it on her brother neck ginny cried mrs weasley ginny ignored her mum just because you show your face around here on holidays and share the same blood as me doesntmean you know me or get any kind of say in how i live my life snapped ginny this was ridiculous she didntknow what charlie problem was but she decided that he was going to get over it very soon or there would be hell to pay you dontlike harry even though he never done anything to you he never done anything to anyone he didntask for this responsibility this burden and who the hell are you to judge him if you think i going to stand here and let you talk about him like that like he malfoy think again i love him just because nobody has ever loved you that way doesntmean ginny charlie stared at her and at her wand too surprised to say anything ginny was vaguely aware that she had made her point that she should stop now before she hurt her brother feelings any more than she already had but she couldntstop the words were coming out and there was no holding them back now she didnt want to hold them back she wanted him to feel bad to realize that although he fancied himself a saint he was merely a sad pathetic man did he even know how poorly he treated the boy she loved did he care how could he say those things about harry how dare he you might think harry a bad person but he is twice the man you ll ever be so what does that say about you ginny turned on her heel and went to storm out of the room but then she reconsidered it and realized that if she was already going to suffer the consequences of this later she might as well get everything off her chest you all treat me like an infant and so it isntany wonder you donttrust me enough to take an active role in this war but i not a child i sixteen i just as old as ron was when he was fighting in the department of mysteries i way older than harry was when he battled voldemort after the triwizard tournament yet somehow everyone seems to overlook those facts she paused ever been possessed by voldemort teenage self and been forced to do awful things or been tortured with round after round of the cruciatus curse between the chamber of secrets and what happened at the wedding this summer i think it safe to say that i ve gone through more mentally perhaps even physically than anyone else in this room and i ve survived why does nobody see that we re just being selfish said ginny you re all just being selfish you all know i can handle anything that thrown at me but you re too scared to let me try mum doesntwant to lose her baby girl and all of you boys like to pretend i some sort of damsel in distress you re keeping me out of this war and it selfish because maybe my role in this could help make the difference between a loss and a victory and if we lose what then little ginny will be safe but for how long harry is the only one who can beat voldemort and he needs love my love mrs weasley opened her mouth to speak but ginny decided that she wasntfinished yet if they want to get to harry and they do i am one of the first if not the very first on voldemort hit list did you know that no you it not as if those death eaters invaded the wedding for fun and it not as if they wanted hermione but grabbed me by mistake that entire thing was orchestrated so voldemort could capture me me i not asking you to be happy that i fighting but i am asking that you respect me enough to realize that i want to protect myself and harry that last sentence said it all didntit she didntwant to fight to protect her family or her friends just harry it was all about harry of course her family wouldntunderstand that but it was how she felt he was it for her his fate would decide hers she was certain that she would survive this war and that he would as well but if he didn t if every negative thing he said came true she knew without a doubt that she would go with him she didntwant to be somewhere if he wasntthere at her side was it even possible for a person to feel as strongly as she did sometimes it was a wonder that she didntburst inside from everything she felt for him she stopped just inside the doorway and turned to address her mother those three are gone she said i know where they are and i know what they re doing yes but you wontever get it out of me if you need to call an order meeting to try and find them then you do what you have to do mum but know that i every ounce as determined and stubborn as you are and i going to do everything in my power to make sure you dontfigure out what they re up to until they re back home and telling you themselves mum we re sorry about this really believe it or not we understand how crazy this is going to make you but we need to do this and we canttell you what this is either please dontcome after us you wontfind us but if you do it ll be disaster for both us and you stay home stay safe and try to remember that we will be home eventually love ron hermione and harry p s we love you and we ll be back soon and i promise we ll have all of our limbs still attached underneath it words that had been scratched out with several long slashes of a quill but which were still rather legible read or at the very least we ll have them in our hands and you can attach them for us as she re read these words for what must have been the millionth time since discovering the note that morning molly weasley closed her eyes at the thought of her son being severely injured perhaps even dying was this honestly happening how could ron even think to leave didnthe understand the danger involved of course he understands a tiny voice in her mind said that what he loves most about all of this it seemed ridiculous and yet it was so true that it caused molly body to shake with the force of her sobs ronnie please not one of her babies why was it that she loved her sons and ginny so much and yet it couldntbe enough to keep them safe why couldntshe do what mothers were supposed to do and make sure her children were happy and healthy and above all alive gone were the days that she would tuck them in at night plant a kiss on their forehead shut the door and know that they would be in that exact place when she came back into their rooms to wake them in the morning now the twins were moved out bill and charlie were far away up until very recently the distance with percy had been emotional as well as physical she thought it would be different with ron her final boy he had always tried to keep up with his brothers and had always admired bill and charlie very much but he d always been such a sweetheart and she d always thought that he d want to stay at home for at least a little while longer than her other sons the year before he d gone off to hogwarts she d looked out the kitchen window and watched him playing on charlie broom she d known that he would leave her to go away to school but he would return home with stories and smiles and would it be too much to hope that he d have top marks no she didntcare if he got top marks she wouldntexpect him to be head boy like percy and bill and she wouldntexpect him to be a quidditch star like charlie or have a sharp sense of humour like fred and george her ronnie would be his own person and no matter what that person was like she would love him just as much as she loved her other children unconditionally and then there was ginny even at the earliest of ages it had been clear that ginny was going to be something else a strong and perhaps selfish weasley personality but with a heart good enough to balance her out at even the worst of times molly thought that she would never have to worry about her daughter who surely would not play that ridiculous sport on those unsafe brooms like her sons insisted on doing her daughter would never get into any sort of trouble in school or do anything particularly daring she would be beautiful but she would never do anything inappropriate she would be passive and would never challenge molly in any way she would not talk back and she would certainly rather read about harry potter in witch weekly than fight and roughhouse with the boys as it turned out molly had been wrong about both of her children ron was not anything like one of his brothers because he had a little bit of them all inside him he was funny and helpful and good at quidditch and a prefect he was rather bright though she wasnthorribly sure he thought so himself he was as loyal as any gryffindor she d ever known not only to his family but to his friends and although she d nearly died herself when she thought she d lost ron she loved him all that much more for the way he d selflessly jumped in front of his sister and saved her and ginny too was nothing like molly had expected her to be her personality was strong and she was as stubborn as the best of them but ginny was just as competitive and talented at quidditch as any of her other children except percy of course and she had been known to get a detention or two in her years at hogwarts she was beautiful and not just through her mother eyes and though she handled it gracefully molly knew that like any other teenager that age ginny had done her share of misbehaving with boys or boy singular harry potter wasntin an article in the magazine in ginny bedroom harry potter was quite simply in ginny bedroom she was loud and perhaps even more aggressive than her brothers she was incredibly daring she went along with ron to the department of mysteries in her fourth year and fought at hogwarts in her fifth year and now as she had reminded molly a few minutes earlier ginny was playing an even more dangerous game molly put her head in her hands ron and ginny were her youngest babies they were supposed to be safe and free from the threat of voldemort who had been vanquished before either of them could speak they werentsupposed to be the ones fighting to get rid of voldemort once and for all even if that meant sacrificing themselves in the process she just couldntdo it she couldntlose one of her children they re good kids molly her husband assured her he d come home from work as soon as her owl had reached him harry would never let anything happen to ron and hermione will be logical and keep him safe perhaps ron would come home to her but at what price would the other two have to make the ultimate sacrifice that wouldntdo there was a reason after all why harry and hermione were also on molly weasley clock okay harry said he was under his invisibility cloak walking beside ron and hermione who were both wearing muggle disguises what does the map say we should be coming up to it hermione said her nose was buried in the map as they walked they trudged along for a minute more and then hermione stopped here it should be right here what the bloody hell exclaimed ron oh my said hermione looking up you re fucking kidding me muttered harry have we got the wrong location said ron no hermione answered this is exactly where the orphanage used to be harry looked around and saw that the surrounding london street was much the same as it had been in the pensieve memories some of the buildings on the strip appeared to be refurbished and he suspected that the road itself had been paved one or twice but it was undoubtedly the same area bugger said ron there there an entire building here what d you think it is asked harry gesturing toward the structure which seemed to be mocking them his eyes ran over the electric fences high concrete walls and no trespassing signs it was suddenly very clear that they would be in for an uphill battle what were they going to do he had expected it to be difficult to get the horcrux but he d envisioned a different kind of challenge altogether this wasntgoing to be about getting past traps and jinxes this was about getting past other people people who would surely not be incredibly anxious to let three strangers into their obviously private building for a quick look around it looks like some sort of government building hermione said or a military base but what would either of those be doing here she shook her head i dontunderstand it oh look she pointed to the side of the building past the fence guards muggles there are ways around them said ron holding out his wand no said harry we cantdo anything that ll draw attention the only way is to take out the guards and we cantrisk getting spotted or caught or worse disarmed as if those muggles could disarm us said ron proudly we ve got wands and they ve got guns hermione replied you dontwant to go up against those trust me you wouldntwin none of us would and besides we are not using magic ron sighed heavily is it possible that this is just a museum or something and the guards are only here to make sure nobody steals or breaks in this doesntlook like a horribly inviting museum said hermione why have electric fences no this is something else entirely i i think there more than meets the eye something doesntfeel right that not our concern said harry we donthave any business with what in there we just need the horcrux excuse me hermione said to a passing woman yes could you tell me what that building is she asked pointing to the unknown structure the woman looked puzzled for a moment um i sorry there said ron extending his own arm and gesturing i i afraid i dontsee anything the stranger said and to her credit the look she gave the pair was only one of mild trepidation ron and hermione exchanged a look oh no said ron we meant can you tell us what that building was there used to be a building there before right or are we just misinformed tourists the stranger smiled no of course um actually i not horribly sure i think it used to be an orphanage a long time ago but it was like this when i was little empty hermione nodded lovely thank you the woman smiled and then continued on her way okay said harry whatever this building is it definitely a magical one and the muggle elements are just in place to make wizards who look at it think it muggle and that everyone can see it so what do we do now bringing herself up onto her toes hermione put one hand on ron shoulder to steady herself there she said that truck what about it asked harry squinting he could only just make out an unmarked truck pulling around to the back of the building i think we just found our way in she said how re we going to shh said hermione i ve got an idea if we re lucky it just might work just might work said ron i dontthink that sounds too promising c mon said hermione we need to get back to the room disclaimer i dontown harry potter i hate writing this story it been so drawn out and even though i originally thought i had so many ideas i starting to doubt myself and hate them all the only reason i haventdeleted this entire thing is because i said a thousand times that i wouldn t i d just let someone else take over writing it but i donttrust anyone to do it justice lately i donttrust myself to do that either chapter forty one 62442 wait said ron say that again you have to hijack that truck hermione said before it gets past the gates i i cantdrive a truck honestly said hermione it cantbe much more complex than flying a silly broom why canti just fly a broom over the fence that what harry and i will be doing explained hermione but you need to be seen you cantjust fly over the walls and then show up out of nowhere and not expect any of them to ask questions in a place as heavily guarded as that one someone will get suspicious ron looked nervously from hermione to harry why cantharry do it no way mate said harry holding up his hands this is all you ron shoulders slumped fine but when we get caught just remember that this job wasntmy choice hermione smiled encouragingly you ll do fine she said far better than either of us i sure you re a much better liar than me that much is clear okay harry said so what the rest of the plan ron will drop off whatever shipment is in the truck the truck was unmarked so who knows what it ll be she said we ll get inside under your invisibility cloak she gestured to the bed where everything they d brought was laid out several objects made up the pile with many weasleys wizard wheezes products resting on the top ron ran a hand through his hair and glanced at them with uncertainty the things i do for you two he muttered we ll be needing this hermione said picking up the omnioculars she d taken from harry possessions judging by the outside appearance of that building i d be willing to guess that each door in there is locked and sealed with a security access code harry doesnthave his penknife anymore right i think if we can catch someone keying in their code we can use the omnioculars to get the code from the replay what else have you got in there then asked ron good thing you thought to dig through our things and pack stuff we sure didn t let see said hermione digging through the pile and holding up several objects a put outer harry sneakoscope my revealer a secrecy sensor and a few of the twins shield cloaks harry looked at her hermione have i ever told you that you re brilliant where d you get a secrecy sensor asked ron hermione blushed well i on one of the last days of school i had to report to filch office during rounds and it was just sitting on his desk you knicked it from filch ron cried i you know we re going to be putting it to much better use now than he would be if it was in his possession she justified did you steal the shield cloaks too and what about all the other products from the store hermione shrugged they were left in the twins bedroom at the burrow i assumed they werentserving any particularly important purpose from their places under the bed ginny gave me them actually i thought some of them werentgoing to be horribly useful but i took them anyway to humour her i suppose we owe her a rather large thank you because they re all going to come in handy it seems harry frowned at the mention of ginny but closed his mind to the images arising in his mind ginny at home trying to calm a hysterical mrs weasley and absolutely livid mcgonagall do i even want to know where you got the put outer asked ron probably not hermione said with a small smirk one that made harry quite curious indeed where she d gotten it okay said hermione she nodded to harry who glanced at ron ready ron asked harry let go said ron harry bit his lip in concentration and waved his hand the truck sputtered and all four of its tires blew out the street was deserted at this time of night and even then hermione had insisted on using the put outer the street was pitch black and without any lights save for the truck headlights which illuminated the area just enough for the trio to find their way to it without incident it was a moment before the driver stepped out of the truck and it was just long enough for hermione to worry that they d injured him when he stepped out into the dim lighting hermione felt her stomach churn he was a she well said ron in a hushed tone that complicates things just a bit hermione will have to do this part said harry me asked hermione but i you know what you need to do said ron this is your plan but we ll get caught whispered hermione frantically i horrible at lying plus i cant drive it was fine when i was the one doing it ron said accusingly that different she said though she knew it wasn t why was it fine for ron to do it but now that it was up to her she was too afraid it wasntfair and she knew that but he just couldntstop the awful feelings that were flying around inside of her she felt ron nudge her lightly between her shoulder blades politely but firmly urging her forward she moved but not before a fresh strong sense of panic washed over her and she nearly drowned in it she was going to do this and do it well because ron and harry needed her their safety not just her own depended on this going well but she as still allowed to be frightened wasntshe she had set out a very detailed list of rules for the three of them to follow but never once had she told them you are not to be afraid she swallowed thickly she could do this if she just approached this as a textbook problem and did it in steps she could do this she would do this go on then she said faintly and harry sprung into action the female driver was unconscious before hermione had even realized that harry had done anything move he whispered picking her up and pulling her back into the truck when hermione and ron made it to his side harry had already using his wandless magic to gain access to the locked area in the back of the truck hermione worked quickly to pull off the driver uniform and she was suddenly very aware of how horribly she was violating this woman they had knocked her out and now a stranger was undressing her if she felt awkward about undressing a stranger it was nothing compared to how awkward it was to remove her own clothes in front of both ron and harry because the back of the truck was very cramped it was after all loaded with unknown contents there was very little space for the three of them to move harry and ron could not turn away because they needed to watch for any signs of trouble and so hermione had no choice but to get nearly naked before them ron had already seen her in this little and harry was showing some tact by not looking directly at her she was too nervous to care that her bra and knickers did not match harry used his wandless magic to awaken the woman keeping her in something similar to a trance in this state she hadnthesitated to answer any of the questions they d posed including who are you and what is in this truck and what is the procedure you must follow upon delivering the items in this truck as it turned out this woman natalie didnthave the slightest clue what sort of supplies she was delivering drivers arententrusted with such information she d said they were merely used to get everything from one place to another once hermione was in position and began slowly and somewhat poorly driving around to the back of the building harry and ron slipped on the invisibility cloak and mounted ron broom think this place has a protective ward up asked ron i hope not harry said because we ve got no other way in they soon discovered that there was no protective ward up and that the electric fence was nearly twice as high as it looked they flew high into the air and harry was somewhat thankful for the unexpected turn of events because hermione probably would have fainted if she d had to ride this broom they touched down on the other side of the fence and their timing was ridiculously good because a side door opened to greet the truck just as they d finished hiding the broom in a bush they slipped through the door the inside of the building was everything and nothing at once and though harry did indeed take in the high ceilings marble floors and fancy d cor he got the feeling he would not be able to recall such details once he left the layout was like a maze inside and harry knew that it was not an accident that he and ron got lost every corridor looked the same and none of the walls were marked with unique or identifiable paintings a large plant occupied a square of space in each corner and fancy chandeliers hung from the ceiling but it was the same at every turn and harry was beginning to get flashbacks to the triwizard tournament why are there no doors and merlin what is this place he heard ron whisper he shook his head wordlessly not even knowing how to describe it there was a pull in the pit of his stomach that he recognized surely but from where and what was it did ron feel it too do you feel that he asked finally unable to keep the tense silence no what it harry voice died away when two men rounded the corner up ahead and began walking straight toward harry and ron is the shipment in then ned getting it now have you got everything ready just about just about it ll be done it had better be done it ll be done severus had better be right about this snape these people were death eaters all of them harry was suddenly very interested in what they were talking about so interested in fact that had ron not carefully but forcefully pulled harry out of the way the men would ve plowed straight through them what the bloody hell was that about ron whispered harshly but instead of referring to the conversation they d just heard he was staring accusingly at harry i you almost got us caught and for what it doesntmatter what they re talking about you said so yourself let follow them said harry did ron not hear or did he just not understand they re gone we re just going to get lost trying to find them ron reasoned we re already lost ron i have to ron angry sigh cut him off fine but it ll be your fault if we die without getting this thing harry flinched and decided not to add that it would already be his fault if that happened to any of them they turned and began to follow the men but as harry soon realized they could have turned down several different corridors and it would be impossible to decide which one was the right one without warning a door appeared and a man stepped out drawing his wand he gave it a complicated wave and the door disappeared he left his dark robes billowing behind him as he rounded a corner whoa breathed ron was it really that there were no doors or was it that the doors would only appear for people who belonged in this building if that was the case harry decided that he and ron were in trouble a woman approached and tapped the wall twice in the exact place where a door had just been harry watched as a small keypad rose out of the wall and hurried to grab the omnioculars from his pocket in order to catch the code she was typing in he recorded it and gripped the omnioculars tightly as the woman slipped inside would she be coming out any time soon they couldntstumble in unless they could be certain the coast was clear was it or would harry be leading them both to their deaths shortly after entering the woman reappeared in the corridor holding a package and left replay it ron urged harry did he played it once then twice the third time he slowed it down to be sure he was seeing the correct code and he was not prepared for what he found six two four four was that another two disclaimer i dontown harry potter which i actually pretty glad for i know that the prophecy says harry cantdie until the final battle or something along those lines blah blah blah but i going to completely and shamelessly twist and change this fact to suit my own purposes good great chapter forty two the cup ron felt harry stiffen beside him what is it he whispered let me see he took the omnioculars the metal warm and slick from harry hands didntwe get the code yeah we got it harry whispered it six two four four two ron knew that those numbers meant something well actually he didn t but the way harry was acting surely they held some sort of significance a date an address but this these people are death eaters harry murmured we know that said ron what was this all about was harry afraid of them harry wasntafraid of anything there are death eaters in the ministry ron blinked what the code ron he said it the ministry code the ministry oh but that would mean maybe it just a joke ron volunteered these death eaters i bet they ve got a wicked sense of humour c mon said harry ignoring him he began to move forward and ron had no choice but to follow him clutching the cloak and trying not to think about what they would find behind the password protected doors harry punched in the code six two four four two and for a moment nothing happened had it taken this long when the others did it the doors opened a moment later to reveal the inside of a lift exchanging looks of confusion harry and ron tentatively stepped inside what floor d you think asked harry ron shrugged then reached out and pressed b the doors closed and the lift began to move down and down until surely they were well underground without warning the lift stopped moving and the doors opened to reveal a room cast almost completely in shadows ron could see only a few feet in front of his face and could not make out any significant shapes the air was musky and thick around them there was a heavy blanket of silence and no indication that anyone else was down there really there was no indication that anyone else had been down there in several years let get started said harry he pulled off the invisibility cloak and held out his hand his eyes closed in concentration small beams of light radiated out of his hand until the entire room was lit there were boxes everywhere piled high on top of each other a wardrobe lay on its side against the wall small objects some broken and others charred had fallen out of their boxes and now littered the floor the rest of the building with its plush decoration and spotless shine did not even remotely resemble this tiny room everything was caked in dust and appeared to be at least twenty years old ron felt certain that the contents of these boxes were from the orphanage hermione hand shook as she reached for the door handle have a good night she said to the man ned who had greeted her she climbed back into the truck and fumbled with the keys for only a moment before the engine started up driving a car was far more complicated than she d hoped luckily she was a quick study and so she didntthink it was horribly obvious that she d never ever been in the driver seat of a car before she put the truck in reverse and held her breath as she backed up out of the gate and back onto the street she drove down to the end of the street and turned off the engine she glanced down at natalie the real driver of this truck hoping against hope that this was the last delivery the woman had to make for tonight she really couldntafford any slipups at this point she shifted in her seat to get comfortable and then reached into her pocket for her wand she didntthink she would need to use it but she felt safer with it clutched in her hand where were ron and harry now did they get inside all right had they been caught were they close to finding the horcrux or were they both in serious trouble and desperately needing her help it occurred to her that in this moment in time hermione was out of touch with literally everyone she had no way of contacting anyone she loved she wished she could talk to ginny she wondered what could be going on at the burrow right now and thought fleetingly that she shouldnthave let ron be the one to write the goodbye note at the very least she should have read it over hermione yawned and leaned back in her seat her head felt heavy and she was fighting to keep her eyes open how could she be so tired at a time like this adrenaline should be coursing through her veins promising her at least two or three more hours of consciousness her eyes closed and when she opened them twenty minutes later there was still no sign of harry and ron she d thought that she should stay there and wait for them but then again how would they see her it was pitch black she wouldntsee them if they were crossing the street three feet in front of the truck it wasntas if they d know to look for her there either what if they went back to the hotel room saw that she wasntthere and assumed that something had happened and she d been caught what if they came back and did something stupid in a desperate attempt to save her when really she was perfectly fine all along making up her mind hermione nudged natalie awake and got out of the truck using the put outer she turned the street lamps back on and then disapparated to the hotel room hoping to find ron and harry waiting for her ron had shifted through so many broken muggle toys and one eyed teddy bears that when he finally did come across a tiny golden cup with a badger engraved on it wrapped in a protective cushioning he d nearly tossed it back into the pile and continued searching after all he had never seen the cup harry had only described it and even though harry had been fairly detailed the object in ron hands didntlook anything like what he d imagined bloody hell he said ignoring the pain in his knees and jumping to his feet i think is this it harry quickly appeared from behind a pile of random objects a cloud of dust rising into the air with his movement he coughed and said let me see ron moved toward him and harry upon seeing the cup let out a barking laugh you found it he said he brought it up to his face and examined it from all angles you found it we can get out of here then yeah c mon ron grabbed the invisibility cloak and they threw it over themselves there was a keypad on the wall similar to the one they d used before hoping that nobody else would be in the lift ron typed in the code which he hoped was the same as it had been upstairs and was relieved when the doors opened to reveal an empty box they scrambled inside what floor were we on asked harry i does it matter that floor had doors to the outside it was on the ground level if we pick the wrong floor we cantget out we could just go out a window said ron and fall to our deaths right said ron bad idea ron closed his eyes and tried to picture the outside of the building there were five floors with windows plus the ground floor the buttons went from b to 15 did that mean they needed to get to the tenth floor deciding that if they were wrong they could simply try again ron pressed 10 and waited when the doors opened and the pair stepped out they were in the same corridor they d started out in had ron chosen correctly or did it only seem that way because every square inch of this place looked exactly the same there was a man standing just to ron right he was looking around with an intense curiosity and ron thought that he must be wondering why the lift had moved on its own of course he didntknow that harry and ron had just stepped out and were now standing a mere two feet away from him they began to walk slowly and ron hoped they were going the right way though there wasntreally any way of knowing harry held the cloak in place with his left hand and clutched the cup in his right they d done it they had the horcrux holding it in his hand was an amazing feeling he wanted to rush home he wanted to go to hogwarts and tell dumbledore that he d done it he wanted to rub it in the order face that he ron and hermione didntneed to be treated like children that they d succeeded on their own he wanted to tell mrs weasley to stop worrying that everything had turned out all right and that they were safe and sound he wanted to tell ginny that he was coming home he lowered his wall but didntget a response he assumed she was sleeping after all it was rather late it started a moment later a small twinge in his head that quickly grew to such intensity that he cried out voldemort it was all consuming and he didntrealize that the cup had slipped out of his hand he didntrealize that he d fallen to his knees he didntrealize that the invisibility cloak was no longer covering him as quickly as the pain came it subsided he gasped for breath and looked around to find ron on the floor beside him half covered by the cloak holding the cup just above the ground with the tips of his fingers he was looking at harry with wide eyes trespassers a voice cried and before harry could even realize what was happening someone yelled out the spell he didntrecognize there was a blinding pain in his stomach and then everything faded away ginny couldntsleep she should be exhausted from arguing with her family every minute since harry ron and hermione had left a part of her was exhausted actually but really how could she close her eyes and sleep when harry was facing so much danger at this very moment how could she sleep when any one of the trio could be dying right now she wished harry would open his mind to her even for a second she was dying here without him it was unbelievable how much she missed him and he d only been gone two days what if searching for this horcrux kept him away for another two days or a week or even more than that she closed her eyes and ordered herself not to think about what could be going on where they were she wouldntlet herself imagine the danger and she certainly wouldntlet herself imagine that they d found the horcrux and were currently on their way home was it really all that difficult for harry to lower his wall for just a minute and say hey ginny i not dead it was common courtesy she would do it for him surely he had to know that she would be a mess without any contact with him unless he was already dead and that was why he wasntcommunicating with her she was being too dramatic she knew that he wasntdead if harry had died she would know she would feel it somehow she knew that she would so he was alive and yet in these past two days he had been completely unable to spare a moment to make her aware of that fact he was going to be in for it when he got back this was ridiculous she should have fought harder she should have forced him to let her go with them she couldntdo this stupid staying behind thing she wanted just for once to be included to be treated equally she was a bloody capable witch maybe not as capable as ever brilliant hermione but she was just as capable as ron and she had a common sense that he often lacked so really why couldntshe fight she was tired of this every second that harry was gone was another second ginny allowed herself to hate him she would be one big ball of anger by the time he got back and he d give into her demands if he knew what was good for him somewhere between missing harry desperately and being absolutely furious with him she drifted off to sleep she didntdream she barely slept actually she awoke shortly after to an awful headache unlike anything she d ever felt before she sighed in relief when it stopped but it was soon replaced with a stabbing pain all across her middle one that made her fall back against the bed and writhe in pain and she knew immediately that it was harry panic gripped her and as she jumped out of bed to wake everyone she silently took back every bad thing she d thought about him tonight harry collapsed backward onto the floor and ron didnthave time to think he couldntstop to wonder if there was an anti disapparition jinx on the building he dove on top of harry and disapparated not even sure if he was still holding the horcrux but knowing that it wasntnearly as important as getting harry out of there when ron opened his eyes again he was in the hotel room he stood up and heard hermione gasp ron you re bleeding what it harry said ron they hit him with i donteven know what he passed out hermione dropped to her knees beside harry he bleeding really badly he he is ron asked he sounded like a child but he couldnthelp it was it really that bad it couldntbe this was harry harry didntmake stupid mistakes he didntget hurt he passed out quite a bit sure but the only times he ever ended up getting really injured were during quidditch matches we have to get home hermione said quickly she grabbed her wand off the bed he needs to go to st mungo s he cantgo there ron cried he has to it ll draw too much attention he argued damn it hermione we can t we donthave a choice he ll be furious when he wakes up if we don t he might not wake up hermione whispered something inside of ron snapped we ll take him to the order mcgonagall can decide he grabbed harry again and apparated home to the burrow unsure if hermione was following him there wasntenough time to care they landed roughly on the kitchen floor it was better he supposed than hitting the table hermione appeared smoothly beside him help is anyone here it harry she cried and really she was doing nothing to help calm ron panic how would they get help in time they needed to find mcgonagall was she at hogwarts what about headquarters and even if they found her quickly what could she do for harry they needed to get a healer where would audrey be or was hermione right about st mungo s harry would be angry but ron would take his friend wrath any day of the week as long as it meant harry lived ginny tore into the kitchen followed by the rest of the family and if ron hadntbeen so wrapped up in the situation he would have realized that it was far too quick of a response they were all awake already but why charlie awoke to the sounds of his sister screaming he sprung out of bed and stepped into the corridor fred and george were passing him quickly yelling his name for him to follow and he did unable to think of what could be wrong but knowing that it would have to be bad to evoke that type of fear from ginny he followed the twins down the stairs and ended up outside of his mum and dad bedroom ginny was there looking smaller and more frightened than he could remember hollering at the top of her lungs mrs weasley was beside her telling her to calm down insisting that she d just had a nightmare it harry she cried it not a nightmare he hurt i need to help him ginny charlie said harry got ron and hermione with him i sure they re fine he didntknow if he believed that and he didntknow if he even cared about harry well being after the argument he d had with ginny yesterday morning he knew he was being ridiculous how could he resent harry for the things ginny had said and yet not be able to resent ginny herself it was quite simple really looking at his sister right now he saw the same scared girl who had been possessed by tom riddle in her first year and this time around who was to blame harry potter he not fine she yelled she turned to the twins we have to do something fred and george exchanged looks it was obvious neither of them knew what to do how d you know he in trouble asked charlie hoping to point out how irrational she sounded i just know she said angrily look there help a voice cried there was noise coming from downstairs is anyone here it harry it was hermione voice and at the sound of it ginny turned and ran down the stairs everyone followed close behind and when they came to the kitchen and saw the state of the trio the only thing going through charlie mind was how could she have known oh gasped mrs weasley she ran toward them and dropped onto the ground beside harry ginny let out a soft sob and lurched forward toward the trio but charlie grabbed her around the middle and held her back she couldntgo there harry she cried and for such a small girl she put up quite a fight she kicked against him squirmed with all her might in an attempt to get free and go to harry he took a foot to the groin and a fist to the face but he refused to let her go if they were going to help harry they would have to act quickly they couldntdeal with ginny being an emotional wreck right now fred said mr weasley get minerva fred ran to the fireplace and went to hogwarts by floo george go to headquarters find audrey and tell her to meet us in the hospital wing george nodded and left mr weasley then pointed his wand at harry mobilicorpus harry still unconscious rose into the air and mr weasley led him toward the fireplace so they could floo to hogwarts ginny continued to fight against charlie he felt like a prat keeping her restrained like this but he couldntlet her go she would want to be at harry side and the healers needed to work quickly if harry was going to live they couldnthave a hysterical girl yelling and crying and getting in their way let me go she cried i have to go to him ron he called needing his brother assistance surely ron would be able to calm ginny down but when charlie looked around he realized that ron had run after harry just as ron would run after charlie bill percy or the twins he realized that harry really was another brother to ron in fact he was probably more a brother than ron actual brothers and hermione the only one who would ever have a hope of getting ron to listen to reason had gone with him of course she had he wondered how he had spent so much time observing the three of them and yet he had never managed to figure out that harry destiny was not just his own that it was also ron and hermione s and that if harry fought they would go because there really wasntanother option when a part of you was fighting for life the rest of you didntstay behind it couldnt get the fuck off of me charlie i mean it she went slack against him and in all of his life charlie had never seen anyone so distraught you cantbe with him right now said charlie it it doesntlook good gin and shut up she screamed let me go you bastard let me go i hate you for this he let his sister go then trying to comprehend what she d just said and she used the opportunity to run after harry ron and hermione disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter forty three brothers ron mum was talking and talking and talking but he really couldntbegin to care about what she was saying harry was dying actually dying and she seriously couldntstop talking for just one minute and slip into a quiet more manageable panic like ron he was moving in slow motion everything was going a thousand miles a minute around him he couldntget perspective this was harry his very best mate in the world his brother one of the most important people in his life the bravest strongest most heroic person ron had ever and would ever know and he was dying now really ron couldntwrap his head around it he understood what dying entailed his uncles had died sirius had died dumbledore had died hell he d even died once he understood that if harry died he would stop living he wouldntbe around for a quidditch game or two he wouldntbe at breakfast or lunch or dinner he wouldntbother ron about hermione or sulk in the corner or snog ginny and even though all of those things irritated him ron couldntimagine not having harry around and doing them for the rest of their lives what happened to him mrs weasley demanded what did they do to him molly said mr weasley calm down calm down harry lying there half dead and you re telling me to calm down mum said fred no said mrs weasley she sounded only half as hysterical as ron felt what happened to him that what i d like to know said audrey what was he hit with ron hermione said she d never sounded so desperate what said ron what spell spell but i i dontknow you werentthere asked audrey i yes i was there he snapped she had some nerve to even suggest that he wasntthere right by harry side right up until the very end but i dont know we were just walking and then he was on his knees yelling and then it it stopped and then these people were running toward us i thought i thought they d just stunned him or something i didntknow he was bleeding i didnt hear i dont remember he was rambling but how could he stop how could he explain that the sight of harry collapsing in pain crying out in a way he d never heard anyone cry out before was so shattering that he could not even breathe let alone stay aware of his surroundings if his own mum had been the one who d hurt harry after that ron still wouldntbe able to pick her out of a lineup right now just help him cried mrs weasley stop looking at ron get back to work save him molly mr weasley said again his calmness got to ron in a way nothing else ever had there was nothing about this situation that didntcall for absolute and total hysterics do you see him she said rounding on her husband do you see harry you look at him and you tell me you dontfeel the same as you would if that was ron lying there i never said that began mr weasley everyone said mcgonagall her voice cut through the room and demanded silence i understand that this is a trying situation but we cannot lose sight of what this is all about what the bloody hell was she talking about lose sight of what this was all about this was about harry what else was there may i have the object in your hand mr weasley it took ron a moment to realize that mcgonagall was speaking to him and not his father huh he said he didnthave anything in his he looked down and saw that his fingers were wrapped tightly around the cup his knuckles were white from gripping it he half handed half threw it to mcgonagall who held it close to her face and inspected it is this what i believe it is she asked he wondered why she didntjust use the word horcrux why she was speaking so cryptically and then remembered audrey presence in the room yeah said ron shall we step out to perform the spell to dispose of it properly was she in the same room as ron did she not realize what was going on just a few feet away from them the logical part of ron mind knew that mcgonagall was just as shaken as any of them it knew that she was trying to help audrey by getting all of the hysterical weasleys out of the way but the logical part of ron mind which was already probably smaller than it should have been wasntactive just now you i what harry might be dying and you think i give a damn about this this this shite are you bloody joking ron mr weasley said mcgonagall no he said i i cant we cantdo this am i am i the only one who realizes what going on harry cant die he can t if he dies that stupid cup is worthless nothing that you think is important matters right now do you understand that mrs weasley surged back into action i i demand some answers ron hermione tell us what happened to harry mum ron yelled his hands over his eyes just shut up please his mum withdrew stung and ron couldntfeel angry or ashamed he couldntfeel anything but concern for his best friend ron said hermione touching his arm he felt like a prat for exploding on everyone but what else was there to do harry cantdie he repeated he won t it just not possible harry not invincible whispered hermione yes he is cried ron do any of you remember who we re talking about it not a story about the boy who lived or the chosen one or whatever else they re calling him these days this is harry this is harry he doesnt he doesnt have any weaknesses he doesntget hurt he doesntever make mum panic this much that my job he this cantbe real it cantbe his voice cracked he lowered his eyes to the floor he couldntbelieve he d said all that he probably sounded like some ridiculous child who obsessed over mighty harry potter but really was there anything wrong with seeing harry that way it was pretty realistic when it got right down to it ron couldntbring himself to look at harry he didntthink he could stand seeing him like this stripped down to his boxer shorts his glasses sitting awkwardly on his face and his skin pale as death audrey worked for quite a while more she may have asked more questions but ron didntconsciously hear any of them it was amazing how everything seemed to blur together before his eyes and when he blinked all he could see was harry dirty face as he and ginny emerged from the chamber of secrets he saw harry on his broom rocketing toward the ground in search of the snitch he could hear harry voice asking him all about the wizarding world during the train ride in first year harry and a dragon during the triwizard tournament harry and malfoy during their duel in first year harry in the hospital wing because lockhart had magically removed all the bones from his arm harry eating chocolate frogs harry playing chess with him even though they d already played five games and it was getting quite boring harry grabbing his invisibility cloak and suggesting they sneak down to hagrid hut that was the harry he knew and for his life he couldntconnect that harry to the person lying in the hospital bed to his left it was possible for harry to die he d already said it but at the same time it wasnta possibility it just couldntbe where would that leave ron his name was almost always said in the same breath and harry s since they were bloody eleven they d been through everything they d gotten into fights but they d always gotten over it and really how many people out there would be willing to put up with him every day for nearly seven years and still want to be around him what if harry and hermione were the only ones he couldntafford to lose one of them they were everything to him merlin he loved harry not the way he loved hermione not the way harry loved ginny but he loved harry as much as he loved any of his brothers maybe more well no not more but it seemed that way now because harry was in trouble and the rest of his family was safe it amazed him how this one single event could stand to alter his entire life he d known that he and harry were putting themselves in a dangerous situation when they d gone into the building looking for the horcrux he thought he d realized that they would have a hard time and that they could die and blah blah blah but realistically the thought of losing harry never entered his mind not for real which was ridiculous because harry did so many dangerous things and as morbid as it sounded it was a miracle that harry hadntdied already he was a ticking time bomb he really was ron would never work up the nerve to say it aloud even to hermione but it was the truth wasntit ron knew he wasntdreaming this right now it had to be real because his mind would never come up with a scenario as awful as this on its own it felt like ron feet had just been knocked out from under him the walls were closing in the room was spinning or something else dramatic that could explain the awful feelings in his chest his heart was beating too fast harry heart could stop beating at any second he was going to be sick he had to sit down he needed to keep moving he had to get out of this room he couldntleave harry he had to do something useful he was in such a state that he d be good for nothing his mind was racing he couldntthink at all his skin felt too small to fit his frame he felt detached from his body altogether he looked up when audrey cleared her throat he lost a lot of blood she said there was some internal bleeding too it took quite a while to get it to stop so what does that mean for his recovery asked hermione how long will he have to stay here audrey paused for a moment i going to ask again she said looking at ron what was done to harry ron opened his mouth but hermione beat him to it ron said he didntknow she said honestly what else is there than that he doesntknow well what were you doing right before this occurred the more i know about this entire situation the easier it ll be to treat harry audrey was being nosey she had already treated harry to the best of her ability knowing about the horcruxes wouldntdo anything to help him if ron thought that it would make even the smallest difference he would have launched into a full scale explanation ages ago he glanced at mcgonagall who did not appear to be horribly impressed with audrey just now ron could understand being curious he could understand that when someone was deliberately being kept in the dark they would desperately want to know what the big secret was all about still no matter what audrey could not know it just wasntan option at this point they were so close to getting rid of all the horcruxes they couldntafford to have it all blow up in their faces by telling the wrong person he didntbelieve that audrey was a spy or a death eater or anything else but at the end of the day audrey had to look out for herself and if she chose to go to voldemort with that information he would hate her indefinitely but she would have legitimate reasons for doing so maybe it not important said hermione just tell us will he be okay audrey posture stiffened i sorry she said harry is my patient and i can only release his confidential medical information to family members you cow gasped hermione tell us like i said i can only disclose such details to family members and since you arenthis family oh mcgonagall would never put up with that ron was rather anxious to see an all out cat fight between audrey and mcgonagall a fight came if it could even be called a fight but not from mcgonagall i have been his family since we were eleven hermione cried and in a flash her wand was out and trained on audrey dontyou dare say otherwise you re going to tell me right now what is happening to him or you ll be in the bed beside him i know some nasty hexes do you want to test me hermione said ron warningly since when did he warn her to watch her step who was this girl it wasntthe hermione he recognized it was as if she was possessed there was a fierce look in her eyes a colour in her cheeks and it occurred to ron that hermione was just as concerned for harry as he was of course she was they were in this together the three of them and maybe they had a daunting task ahead of them maybe it seemed hopeless at times but they had each other they had a lot more than most people did he wished harry would wake up he didntthink his friend would believe him later if ron told him that hermione had threatened to seriously harm audrey tell me now how long will he have to stay here right now i d say about two weeks said audrey finally she turned her gaze back to harry she at least had the grace to look embarrassed at her previous behaviour but it could be less less than two weeks it couldntbe all that serious then it could be longer as well she added complications could arise and magic and potions cantcure everything in a day or two however i see no reason why harry wontbe up and about soon ron felt so relieved that he could not even express it in a single insignificant act he couldntsigh he couldntsmile he couldnteven speak he would move mountains if he could he would fight all of the death eaters in england he would fly without a broom it occurred to him randomly that he would need to learn how to do that if he was going to be flying anywhere from now on they d left his broom behind it was still in the bushes where they d hidden it ron realized that there would come a day probably someday soon where he would need that broom for something and he would be annoyed that he d lost it but right now all he could feel was overwhelming happiness that harry was going to be all right thank you mcgonagall said now i must ask that we leave miss fiske alone to tend to harry may i see everyone else in the headmaster office everyone reluctantly piled out of the hospital wing ron spotted ginny sitting in a ball on the floor just outside the entrance and it was then that he truly noticed her absence from the previous events gin he said ginny sniffed he dead she whispered isnthe ron knelt down beside her no he said no harry fine he ll be fine she studied his face for a moment as if searching for a sign that he was lying to her but i i cantfeel him anymore she said what d you mean ginny took a breath there something i ve got to tell you mr weasley mcgonagall called miss weasley yes professor i ask that you please join the rest of us ron nodded and glanced back at ginny can it wait he asked ginny shrugged with a hand from ron she got to her feet she seemed so tiny beside him smaller than usual and he automatically put his arm around her as they walked not that she needed his help his sister was strong that was for sure nobody could deny that upstairs mcgonagall sat the hufflepuff cup on dumbledore desk this is the horcrux she asked ron nodded i sure hope so he said no bloody way we re going back there even if it isn t mcgonagall waved her wand around and said that foreign but by now somewhat familiar incantation it seemed like it took ages for her to finish ron tightened his grip on ginny as they waited for any sort of reaction questions ran through his mind the same as always what if this wasntthe real horcrux what if they d gone through all of this for nothing but the purple glow came and even though it was a small comfort it was good to know that harry hadntgone through all of that for absolutely nothing he would be pleased as all hell when he awoke that was the thing with harry his well being never quite mattered to his as much as the war and the horcruxes and voldemort can we go back downstairs now asked ginny mcgonagall nodded softly yes miss weasley she granted ron ginny and hermione immediately moved toward the door mr weasley miss granger i am afraid you two must remain here after all we have not yet heard the story of how you came into possession of this latest horcrux you can wait grunted ron and before anyone could think to protest the three of them were gone audrey wasntthere when they got back to the hospital wing whether she had stepped out temporarily or would be gone for the remainder of the night ron didntknow he hoped she wouldntbe coming back anytime soon though right now he just wanted to sit with harry undisturbed he pulled up a chair at harry bedside hermione sat in a chair beside his and ginny was on the other side of the bed harry fingers entwined with her own ron knew then with a sort of realization that sometimes dawned on him at the strangest of times that he would never not ever be in better company than he was right now he smiled at the three and tried to take from this situation all of the good things that it offered the trio was back home they d found one of the last remaining horcruxes and harry would be fine though it may take a week or two for him to be fully healed what did you have to tell me before asked ron ginny did not blink and so he knew it would be important right i know we probably should have told you a while ago but it just didntseem like a good idea you cantfreak out you d better not be pregnant said ron immediately he wasnteven sure if he really thought that was possibly what she was going to say it was just a reflex he d been a big brother for too long to get out of habit now ginny rolled her eyes but didntstop sweet merlin no she said look when you three got back to the burrow tonight and hermione started yelling for us to help we were already awake i d woken everyone up because i knew that you would be coming and that harry would need help hermione breathed deeply how could you have possibly known that i was sleeping explained ginny and when i woke up my head was killing me it felt like it d been cracked open and then i felt this awful pain in my stomach i knew it was harry because because we re in each other heads ron didntreact he didntknow how to react was she kidding what we re in each other heads she repeated i can hear his thoughts and he can hear mine what asked ron was she actually being serious this was real stop saying that said hermione how oh because that so much better mumbled ron but still he waited for ginny answer we dontknow she said one day my thoughts were my own and then the next they just weren t i mean they re still my thoughts but now i not the only one listening to them we can hear everything we can communicate you know without words so wait ron said you know about everything going on in harry mind ginny nodded and that doesntget him in trouble well it did at first said ginny but it been so long we can control it now what d you mean we have these mental walls she explained we can raise and lower them when we need to we mostly keep the walls up i mean i dontthink either of us really cares to hear what the other thinking about all day long but if i want to talk to harry i ll lower my wall and he can feel it in his head it this kind of nudging sensation like someone trying to gain access to your mind so he ll lower his too or vice versa what if he doesntwant to talk to you inquired ron was it wrong that he found this semi amusing then he doesntlower his really ginny could really read harry mind so do you two have the same dreams and stuff he asked no she said it doesntwork when one of us is asleep then you cantsense him right now said hermione and ron made the connection with what ginny had said earlier about not being able to feel harry right now said ginny right now harry gone completely gone it not the same as when he just sleeping i donteven think i could put my wall down and reach him if i tried will it come back i have no idea she said i hope i cant i never thought i d feel lonely because the only thoughts running around up in my head were mine but i do just lower your er wall cantyou try asked ron what the worst that could happen that the thing ginny said i cantlower it i canteven locate it it hard to explain i could never do it before harry was in my mind because i didnthave a wall there there was nothing i was blocking out and it feels like that now that why i thought harry was dead but maybe he just gone you know from my mind maybe he ll come back suggested hermione ginny nodded slowly yeah maybe anyway i just wanted to tell you two harry and i sort of agreed that we wouldn t but i think earlier when my head hurt i think that was voldemort i think he was trying to get into harry mind but he got more than he bargained for because he ended up in mine too ron could see it replaying in his mind eye harry crying out and falling to his knees hands pressed against his forehead i think you re right gin he agreed does harry know that you re telling us this asked hermione have you two talked about it ginny shook her head the thing is we kind of promised that it would stay between us but it cantanymore this connection if it comes back is going to help keep him safe i know it will just like it would have tonight if you two hadntbeen there for him already you think asked ron harry is determined to win this war at all costs said ginny it doesntmatter to him if he lives or not as long as voldemort goes down he fighting for everyone else so it up to us to fight for him i ll do whatever it takes hermione agreed i cantimagine a world without him ron nodded his agreement harry would live through this war he would marry ginny and officially become his brother their kids would grow up together they would take trips to foreign places like romania and america and this time they would get to enjoy it harry would die a long long time from now old and absolutely fulfilled ron simply would not accept anything less for his best friend disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter forty four revelation it had been two days and ginny didntstray very far from the hospital wing harry still hadntwoken up but she was hoping that he would soon perhaps her mum would tone it down a notch if she had some sort of reassurance that harry was indeed going to make a full recovery mrs weasley had been operating at warp speed for the last forty eight hours she was in and out of the hospital wing every few hours and each time she returned she carried with her a new message from audrey between still running the house and helping out with the order and fussing over an unconscious harry it amazed ginny that her mum still had enough energy to yell at ron and hermione but she was a weasley and so it made sense that she would schedule time for conflict judging by the stories she heard from ron and hermione ginny was almost relieved that she was spending most of her time at harry bedside it bloody ridiculous ron told her the three of them were sitting around harry hospital bed we re getting up early every morning and doing chores she wonteven let me go to training and she wontlet us out of her sight for more than twenty minutes because she thinks we re going to leave again as if we d leave without harry he sighed dramatically and leaned back in his chair tell her hermione ginny looked to hermione who shrugged it is rather annoying she said but we did take off without telling her to be fair none of this is fair ron complained i ll be eighteen in a few months i dontneed someone following me around all bloody day long hermione sighed we left without saying a word she said i sure she was worried sick your mum has gone through a lot lately she has a right to want to keep you close especially after what happened she trailed off but it was no wonder to anyone what hermione meant oh so it my fault he snapped standing up hermione stood up as well her eyes wide i never said that you didnthave to say it ron admit it he said you think the reason my mum a mess is because she thought i was dead before go on say it it my fault would you both shut up ginny demanded she right said hermione we donthave time to fight we have to start looking for the next horcrux ron crossed his arms it doesntmatter we cantdo anything until harry wakes up anyway we might have to she said what he going to need quite some time to recover and who knows when he going to wake up we might have to keep looking without him said hermione and ginny winced she didntwant to think about how long it would take harry to get back on his feet and she knew that ron didn t either he was quite unresponsive to the idea of harry being anything other than perfectly okay when he awoke in fact ginny thought that bringing this sort of thing up right now would probably start another fight between the two of them we cantgo anywhere without harry we can and we probably will she argued honestly if you dontstart damn it hermione you want to boss us around like always but we arenteleven anymore harry is in charge here not the order and not my parents and not you cried ron harry seen things done things that i canteven imagine things that you ve never read about in any of your stupid books we dontknow and he does so we re going to listen to him and do what he tells us to because we re all going to die if we don t i not going to sit on my hands and feel absolutely helpless because my name isntharry potter this war is about more than that this war is about harry and voldemort argued ron harry is the war he doesntget to run away and hide when it gets tough neither do we screamed hermione yes we do we never would but if it came down to it with voldemort if there was a moment when we absolutely had to run we could go and it wouldntchange the outcome of anything there a difference between us and him there always has been his voice broke harry he doesntget the choice like we do ginny bowed her head because it was an awful thing to think about what her brother had just said these were the thoughts that ran through her mind all the time that kept her up at night that made her lose her appetite verbalizing them hearing ron of all people verbalize them was too much this was all true but only on the condition that harry woke up what if harry never woke up she fought for her breath at the idea of harry being like this forever try as she did she could not get herself to care that the wizarding world would be doomed without harry potter to save them she could only think of herself and how she wouldntbe able to survive if harry wasntthere with her so you you have to respect that and you have to respect the fact that you might be a hell of a lot smarter than harry and me combined but you still cantdo a bloody thing without him ginny harry groaned she felt her heart jolt and suddenly the moment was forgotten it didntmatter that ron and hermione were arguing over serious things instead of just their regular pointless disagreements over whether or not a book about quidditch could be considered literature harry she said blinking furiously she wanted to make sure this was real had she fallen asleep not likely given the noise ron and hermione had been making ron and hermione were at harry beside immediately and the only indications of their fight were ron flushed cheeks and hermione shining eyes ginny he repeated his eyes pressed tightly closed you re killing my hand she looked down actually surprised to see her hand knuckles white gripping harry s she loosened her grip but didntlet go harry was awake finally was she the only one who thought it seemed like years since she d seen the colour of his eyes how are you feeling she whispered he looked at her this is where i act really tough and say i feel fine he said his smirk faint but there and she melted what happened ginny looked to ron for the answer she d heard the story told so many times but she never gave it the chance to sink in all she knew was that harry had been hurt because none of the other facts had mattered you tell me said ron one minute you had the horcrux and we were about to get the hell out of there and the next you were on your knees yelling your bloody head off harry eyes closed briefly voldemort he said i forgot he was in my head like that time at the ministry i must have collapsed i d say said ron the invisibility cloak came off you and someone saw you so they fired a spell and sliced you up real nice so that why i feel like i ve been cut in half he muttered what happened then ron shrugged i grabbed you and got the hell out of there what harry cried sitting up he winced lay back down ginny ordered getting to her feet harry didntmove what about the horcrux he asked ron tell me you grabbed it before you grabbed me dontbe ridiculous said hermione you come before any stupid horcrux no i dont harry snapped he looked at ron whose expression changed dramatically well yeah we got it ron mumbled and he didntsound half as pleased as ginny thought he should thank merlin harry said he frowned bugger we left the invisibility cloak behind ron shook his head no we got it it was tangled up with us when we apparated to the hotel room hermione and i went back yesterday to get all of our things and check out i found it and brought it back oh said harry thanks everything audrey had instructed ginny to do came rushing back to her and she reached for a potion drink this she said holding it out for harry he stared at it for a long while before drinking it and then appeared to be fighting his gag reflex after he d swallowed disgusting he complained lying back down there was silence for a moment ginny closed her eyes and wished for the ability to communicate with harry again where had their connection gone shouldntit have come back when he d woken up she couldnteven believe how empty her head felt now without harry thoughts mingling with her own how could she have become so addicted to harry they hadnteven kept their walls down very often she regretted that now she should have known that their gift would be only temporary she should have savoured it instead of ignoring it and treating it as though it was a strange inconvenience as if harry was reading her mind which she realized with a pang was no longer possible he looked at her with startled eyes how come i cant he asked and then trailed off ron and hermione were with them and as far as harry knew neither one of them knew anything about their connection i dontknow she whispered i canteither not since you were hurt ron and hermione exchanged looks and ginny knew that they both understood what she and harry were talking about she hoped harry had missed their expressions at the time she d thought telling ron and hermione was the best possible move now though she had to wonder what would happen when harry found out that she d told hadntthey agreed not to tell anyone would harry understand if she explained that he was unconscious and she was terrified would he realize that ginny had known harry was hurt and she would eventually have to explain to someone the real reason why she d known or would he be furious with her would he push her away like he always did harry jaw clenched it ll change he said and she recognized the panic in his voice because it matched her own it has to ron cleared his throat we should probably go tell mum that you re awake he said and lupin they ll want to come by harry nodded can you try to stall though he asked ron looked from harry to ginny yeah he said i ll try ginny watched ron and hermione leave harry sat up again and she didnttry to have him lay back down c mere he said shifting in his bed to make room for her she climbed into bed next to him and rested her head on his shoulder does it hurt she asked not that much he said that potion helped she sniffed what is it he asked it nothing she said but it wasnt nothing it was something i just you were bleeding so badly hermione was crying and and charlie said you d i thought you were going to she let her voice die out she couldntbring herself to say the words especially not in front of harry i sorry he whispered and held her tightly in his arms as she let herself cry all right said bill charlie head snapped up what the hell is wrong with you he and charlie had both been home at the burrow for the better part of two days and charlie had spent every second of those two days sulking whatever was the matter with him it was starting to get on bill last nerve charlie looked away she said she hated me he said who ginny the other night when harry was hurt and i wouldntlet her go after him she told me she hated me she was worried about harry bill told his brother she doesnthate you you didnthear her the way she said it she hates me she doesn t she couldn t then why would she say it oh like you ve never said anything you didntreally mean asked bill listen here little brother if i had a knut for every time you said you hated me when we were kids i would be a rich rich wizard today we were kids charlie argued ginny sixteen merlin bill was just trying to be a good brother and cheer him up but charlie was really making it hard on him there was an awkward silence bill knew that ginny didnthate charlie in fact he was positive that charlie knew this as well there was something else bothering him something charlie wasntsaying part of him wanted to be a good brother and listen another part of him wanted to leave because charlie was acting like a poof did you know they re sleeping together who asked bill conversations with charlie seemed to jump all over the place harry and ginny bill eyes widened how do you know you didnt ew you didntwalk in on them did you merlin no said charlie i just know that they are haventyou seen them together they must be bill shrugged he wasntsure that charlie was right but either way what did it matter so what do you want from me it wasntthat bill didntcare because he did he cared about the important things like whether or not ginny and harry were being smart and safe but ultimately it wasnthis place to pry despite what charlie obviously thought bill knew that ginny was old enough to make her own decisions what i want is for you to care just a little bit that our baby sister who only sixteen is already sleeping with her boyfriend snapped charlie this is harry fault i know it is bill laughed outright harry now i know you ve lost it i wouldntput it past him i would said bill ginny is no angel she never has been she always taken after the twins and anyway i seem to remember you being quite popular with the girls at sixteen you mean to tell me that when you were her age you hadntever it different why because she a girl you didntdo it alone you know or maybe you did it different said charlie because harry is not going to be around when this is all over ginny she going to die without him as much as i hate to admit it they arentexaggerating or putting on a show when they re around the rest of us hell when they re together they donteven realize the rest of us are there they re in love and ginny going to be crushed in the end bill frowned since when was charlie so pessimistic about this war couldnthe put on a brave face and tell himself that everything was going to be all right that was what bill was doing that was what they all were doing because the fact that harry was just a boy going up against one of the most powerful wizards in history was something they were all in denial about bill would never say it aloud he barely allowed himself to think it and it had worked so far ever heard that it better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all he asked whoever said that obviously wasntreferring to his little sister charlie muttered and then walked away the next two days progressed slowly for harry he didntfancy being stuck in the hospital wing for two weeks and had already gotten audrey to agree to release him after just one promising that he would relax and take it easy at the burrow if it was up to him he would get up out of his bed that very moment really though he knew that mrs weasley would never let him and he would force himself to obey her because he d put her through enough lately he d never tell them but he d heard practically everything ron and hermione had been arguing about it was probably their shouting that finally woke him up actually he d heard hermione insist that she and ron continue to look for horcruxes without harry and he d heard ron explain to her that they needed harry because harry was the war and because harry was the only one who didntget to choose whether or not he fought strangely enough the part that had bothered harry the most wasntwhat ron had said but what hermione had said he knew that his friends would never desert him but the thought that hermione hadntwanted to wait for harry to recover it was hard to handle ron and hermione were already independent from harry in so many ways growing up they had always been the trio but now ron and hermione were a couple that meant that harry had to give them space and alone time he didntmind that so much because it meant he got to spend time with ginny without having to feel like he was ditching them it was different though because harry had finally just begun to accept that his friends would be with him every step of the way as opposed to him doing this by himself and suddenly they were jumping ship and trying to do everything without him since when was harry an expendable part of the war he wasnt he was one of the most important players in this war ron and hermione were the expendable ones he didnt want to play the role he did but his hand had already been dealt and he had to see it through no matter what ron and hermione didn t he was glad that ron had said what he said at least ron had thought about it and understood that even though he and hermione would want to fight alongside harry for everything they wouldntbe able to at least ron realized that there would come a time that harry would have to stand on his own and face voldemort alone at least ron accepted that harry and only harry was destined for this he felt a twinge in his scar and frowned he d been getting pains in his scar on and off since the night he d sensed voldemort he couldntunderstand why he d felt voldemort that night away his scar hadnthurt for quite some time now in fact he could hardly remember the last time it had so much as throbbed so why now what had made voldemort so furious did he know that harry and ron had found the horcrux was it possible it was obvious that voldemort knew some of the horcrux had been destroyed riddle diary was common knowledge it was even possible that voldemort knew the locket had been stolen by regulus and snape had known about the ring dumbledore found harry was certain that snape had run straight to voldemort and told him but did voldemort know that harry was looking for the rest of the horcruxes himself did voldemort even know that harry knew would he assume that dumbledore had told him had dumbledore told snape who told voldemort those were only a few of the possibilities perhaps it was something other than anger that harry had felt was voldemort happy normally harry could distinguish between the two but this time it had just been a blinding pain on harry part there was no emotion tied to it is something wrong harry looked up to find ron and hermione watching him no he said my scar hurts a bit but i fine hermione frowned how long has it been hurting not long harry said can you feel voldemort ron asked no harry said and it was only a half lie ron was asking if he could feel voldemort through his scar and the answer in his opinion was no but he d be lying if he said that there wasntan occasional thought in his mind a rush of feeling in his veins a tingling in his fingertips that did not come from himself what is it questioned hermione what arentyou telling us i dontknow harry said he sighed this was ron and hermione he told them everything and he could tell them this i just sometimes i feel like that a the words died on his tongue he finished the sentence in his mind like there a part of voldemort inside of me what is it hermione asked again he said nothing he couldntsay anything even if he wanted to it was as if a force greater than any magic he knew of was controlling his body as he jumped out of his bed and ran out of the hospital wing he was sure ron and hermione were running after him but he couldntpossible stop to explain things now there wasntenough time there would never be enough time his mind was racing he needed a minute to stop and think he needed to sort out all of his thoughts but hermione would never keep quiet long enough for him to actually do that already behind him he could hear her muttering to ron that being out of bed wasntgood for his recovery no he wouldntlet them catch up because then he d have to explain everything to them and he wasnteven sure he understood this himself he needed to talk to ginny she would listen she would help him sort this out he needed to get to the burrow right away so he could talk to her in private he ran up to dumbledore office to use the fireplace he stopped in his tracks when he heard his former headmaster call his name i see that you are in a hurry dumbledore said and forgive me for delaying you but is there anything that i may be able to assist you with harry turned to regard dumbledore struck with the thought that his old headmaster of all people would be the best to ask about this if anything dumbledore had probably considered this scenario a thousand times before harry could hardly believe he hadntconsidered it before but despite how many nights harry had spent in this office with dumbledore talking about the horcruxes dumbledore had never said one word to harry about this how could he not have addressed it it suddenly occurred to harry that dumbledore best option had been to never breathe a word of his suspicions to harry to merely keep him close by and keep tabs on him to see what would happen that was why dumbledore had always asked him if his scar had been hurting if he could sense voldemort emotions had dumbledore taken him under his wing spent night after night telling him that this war had to be ended at all costs relentlessly drilling that fact into his mind simply because of this betrayal and anger coursed through him and he thought fleetingly that dumbledore was bloody lucky he was dead because harry surely would not hesitate to kill him in this moment ron and hermione were there behind harry now but he paid them no notice i think you ve already done enough professor harry spat and then used the fireplace to get to the burrow before he could do something he thought he might regret much later lunch was still going on at the burrow and all of the weasley minus ron were seated around the kitchen table mcgonagall tonks and lupin were also there mrs weasley was the first to look up upon harry arrival and she immediately stood and went to him harry she scolded you re supposed to be resting i need to talk to ginny he said his voice sounding mechanical to his own ears it important over mrs weasley shoulder harry could see that ginny was coming over to them her features twisted into a mask of concern harry it ll have to wait until later mrs weasley said you need to get back to bed ron hermione didnteither of you think to stop him you know harry mum said ron impossible what going on asked ginny who finally managed to sidestep her mum and face harry she put a hand on his cheek you re shaking he was yes now that he looked down at his hands he could see that they were indeed shaking i i have to tell you something he whispered what is it she asked harry looked around the room noticing that every eye was training on him could he really just blurt it out in front of everyone i cantsay it here he said it about the horcruxes okay she said let just go upstairs then hold up charlie said perhaps it was harry frazzled demeanor or ron and hermione matching frowns of confusion and worry or even fred off colour joke about what the two would do upstairs but whatever it was charlie did not seem exceptionally keen on letting the pair out of his sight everyone here is in the order harry horcruxes are order business anything you have to discuss you can do here with the rest of us if harry wasntso preoccupied with everything else going on in his mind he would have hated charlie just then but instead he nodded unhappily and shrugged at ginny letting her know that there was really nothing he could do to beat that sort of logic i have a question harry said to everyone though he was really only paying attention to mcgonagall now that what you left the hospital wing and rushed over here for asked ron is there any way harry asked ignoring ron to be able to tell if an object is a horcrux without doing the spell that destroys it mcgonagall frowned no she said after thinking for several moments not that i am aware of our knowledge of horcruxes is very limited at this point why do you ask because i when you do the spell it removes the soul right he asked voldemort soul honestly this information was nothing he hadntalready figured out for himself and the answers were nothing more than what hermione could have told him had he asked but he needed mcgonagall to say it he needed to hear it from her yes said mcgonagall everyone stared at harry as though he was losing it but what about nagini he asked dumbledore told me that it would be more difficult to make a horcrux out of a living thing because it already had a soul so if you were to do the spell on nagini would both of the souls be destroyed it is certainly a possibility said mcgonagall one that i think makes the most sense oh said harry feeling incredibly dejected despite the finality of his entire situation and despite the fact that he had never been horribly optimistic in the first place he felt his heart plummet into his shoes so the snake would still be alive just without a soul if you can count that as living lupin said and harry nearly flinched harry said mr weasley what this all about it was strange harry thought how he d rushed over here to discuss this with ginny but now that he had to say it aloud she was the last person he wanted to tell it the horcruxes he said i think i think i know what the final one is i dont it not nagini what is it asked tonks harry took a steadying breath looking anywhere but at ginny it me happy birthday to me review disclaimer i dontown harry potter please dontthink for a second that i support the harry is the seventh horcrux theory i really don t i think a lot of the arguments for this idea make sense but it just seems too convenient i dontthink jkr would ever make it happen in the books not because harry would die but because it just seems too easy for her i dontparticularly like this idea but realistically i had to incorporate it i mean harry would have to be an idiot not to at least consider it and that what i making him do here so please dontassume that the rest of this story is going to play out with the plot that harry is a horcrux because i trying my best to not go down that alley i sure you readers have seen it done way too many times already chapter forty five hero complex for several endless moments harry didntreceive any reaction he began to question whether or not he d even said it aloud and then they all started that impossible when you re out of your harry dear dont potter you cantjust you consider the facts bloody fucking mind say such awful things blurt out things without thinking harry felt anger bubbling up inside of him did they think he wanted this to be true the way there were reacting the things they were saying it was almost as if they thought harry had chosen this path for himself the arguments died down and suddenly all eyes were on harry again he could feel their stares burning into him but what could he do smile and make it all better his hands were tied this was the first time in a while that harry could remember feeling so absolutely hopeless about literally everything never in his life had he pretended to believe that things would work out there were very few moments that he d actually allowed himself to have hope but this shift in his professed destiny hit him square in the chest and coupled with his injuries it managed to knock the wind out of him there really was no way out his last fight was coming and coming fast he didntget a choice in the matter he didnteven have a fighting chance still he accepted his life if tom riddle had remained a troubled wizard instead of turning into lord voldemort harry would still have a mum and a dad and a godfather he would have a whole other life in some strange parallel universe he believed that there was a harry potter living happily with all of these things the things he lacked here in his own world but tom riddle had become lord voldemort and harry had ceased wondering about all the possibilities if brought him long ago for the same reason he d stopped spending night after night looking at the mirror of erised fantasy a place where he was blissfully able to have everything one could ever want exactly when one wanted it had a drugging pull and sometimes he thought he could lose himself in it if he tried he was comfortable with his destiny really he was as much as one could be at least because what else was there for harry nothing everyone else in his life had a role to play ron was a son a brother a strategist a warrior hermione was a daughter a thinker a star student an elf liberation activist ginny was a sister a maverick a boyhood crush if there ever was one mrs weasley was a mother of seven mr weasley was a provider tonks was an auror a protector mcgonagall was a professor a headmistress the leader of the order and harry was the boy who lived the chosen one the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord he was born to beat voldemort that was all there was to it and if he didnthave that if he didnthave the title of boy who loved to put to his name what did he have his parents were dead he had no siblings he wasnta brilliant student he wasntoutgoing or funny or particularly interesting he wasntanything at all really he felt certain nobody would have ever noticed him at hogwarts if it hadntbeen for his scar and the fact that the daily prophet had nobody better to put on their front page harry potter was just a name a legend a scar if he was wrong about this horcrux theory if he lived past all of this if the name lost its appeal and the legend stopped being passed on and the scar faded what then he d spent most of his life locked up in a cupboard under the stairs being ignored by a family who did their best to hide the proof that they were truly related he d spent the last six years emerged in a world of uncertainty and danger he knew better than to look for a way of out this war he was a warrior fighting voldemort and other dark magic was all he really knew how to do he could duel but how far could that get him after the war he would have ron and hermione he would have ginny but he couldntmake them the center of his world when he would only a part of theirs he was kidding himself with ginny anyway he couldntlove her he d grown up in a situation in which love didntexist for him he could try but he couldntever succeed he couldntlove her the way she deserved to be loved he didntknow why he was wasting his time thinking about this he wasntgoing to survive this war but was that really such a bad thing he loved the people in this room as best he could even though it probably wasntgood enough and he was showing that love by fighting he was fighting searching for horcruxes going through hell training and strategizing working with the order when he secretly thought it was pointless for them as long as they made it through this whole ordeal and went on to live long happy lives he didntcare about himself all that much besides he d been waiting all of his life and he thought he d very much like to meet his mum and dad and he d love to see sirius again how bad of a place could the other side be if people like that were there waiting for him it wasntas if he was hoping to die despite the morbid thoughts that sometimes went around and around in his mind he would never choose death over life but he d given it a lot of thought recently and he reached the conclusion that he was quite simply destined to fight voldemort and when that fight was over even if his side won out harry knew that he would be dead when your destiny was fulfilled there was no other reason for you to stick around this doesntmake any sense hermione declared why would voldemort make you a horcrux if he planned on killing you i mean if he was stashing his soul wouldnthe want to put it in something a little more permanent something he knew would still be around in a year or two harry winced at her words though they were true and hermione eyes widened i dontmean it like that she cried quickly and maybe she really hadn t but she was too logical for her own good and so harry would bet his life that she d known exactly what she d been saying at least on some level i just saying that voldemort is trying to kill you not keep you safe like the other horcruxes except said harry voldemort hasnttried to kill me since fifth year d you think it because he got tired of the chase and decided to give up not likely hermione shook her head and when would he have done this she asked voldemort went to godric hollow when you were a baby to kill you he wouldnthave made you a horcrux just incase things backfired voldemort wouldntever take precautions he never would have considered failure a possibility for himself harry shook his head i not saying that he said but he possessed me back at the department of mysteries the night sirius died did i ever tell you that ron spoke up you dontreally think that while he possessed you he we thought the snake was a horcrux because voldemort could easily possess it like he did on the night mr weasley was attacked voldemort can possess me just as easily when i not using occlumency said harry there a reason his death eaters are never allowed to hurt me and i starting to think it not just because voldemort wants to finish me off himself this is ridiculous mrs weasley said but her voice cracked he wanted seven horcruxes if he d only made six by the night he came to kill me that means he d been planning to make the seventh one after i d been killed but i didntdie and so he had to wait until he regained his power to make the last one he had to wait until after he came back at the end of our fourth year and what did he have to lose by making me the last one nothing what do i have to lose his eyes strayed to ginny for the first time since he began speaking everything no ginny said fiercely and either must die at the hand of the other we all know that i the only one who can beat voldemort but in order to do that i need to destroy all of the horcruxes first he said isntit the perfect plan if i a horcrux then the only way we can even prepare to fight voldemort is if i destroyed first and the only way we can beat voldemort is if i the one who does it both contradict each other if i dontdestroy myself but i get rid of the others and then i actually beat voldemort who to say that the part of his soul in me wouldnt i dontknow turn me into him that would never happen cried ginny says who says me mrs weasley sighed seemingly appalled with her daughter attitude ginny stay out of this mum ginny growled glaring at harry and he finally understood what ron meant when he said ginny could be just as intimidating as mrs weasley when she tried harry hermione said and whether she spoke because she had an idea or because she wanted to keep ginny from making the situation worse harry wasntsure you cantpossibly be so sold on this idea you donteven know for certain and there are so many aspects you haventconsidered how would she know why did hermione always have to act like such a bloody know it all this was more complex than she realized maybe harry hadntconsidered every possible aspect but did that mean he was wrong nobody could deny that his idea made a hell of a lot of sense like what like maybe you re right and you are going to have to die for this but what if you make a horcrux of yourself beforehand would you be able to come back just like voldemort planned on doing yeah said ron lamely you could do that that would work maybe said harry his heart pounding except if this is true and part of voldemort soul is inside of me who to say the horcrux wouldntretain my soul and his he looked at hermione but she said nothing c mon he challenged what do you say to that she didntspeak exactly you and i both know that it wouldntbe worth the risk not worth the risk bellowed ron of course it would be worth the risk if it meant keeping you alive that isntthe concern here said harry coldly well maybe it my concern yelled ron and he looked so afraid yet so determined the room fell momentarily silent harry could do nothing but look at his best mate who he d grown up with who he loved like a brother he knew that when he died it would be hell for ron just the way it had been hell for him when ron had died but how could ron stand before him and act like harry was the enemy wasntharry doing them all a favour by bringing this up and making them realize it was a possibility that it was going to happen whether they liked it or not why is it you why does it have to be you ginny demanded as if he hadntjust verbalized most of the thoughts and explanations he had running around in his head he possessed me in first year am i to believe that i the final horcrux now harry hadntconsidered this gin she stormed over to harry and kissed him hard on the mouth he knew she d lost it then because there was no reason at all why she could possibly think doing that in front of her entire family would be a good idea she pulled away and he saw something in her eyes that terrified him you think i haventconsidered this before you think i haventlaid in bed and night thinking to myself maybe harry wontbe able to find the last horcrux because that little piece of soul is floating around somewhere inside his own body i have she told him he wondered how ginny could come up with such an idea ages ago and yet he hadnteven considered this a possibility until just now i ve thought about it more than you know i ve worried myself sick over it but would i kiss you if i thought you were somehow breathing tom soul into me ginny harry said pleadingly though he wasntsure what he was asking for just remember that i poured my heart into that diary for nearly a year i know what something with a hunk of tom riddle in it is like it doesntwork like that he said then how does it work she demanded he didnthave an answer for her but just because he didntknow enough to be able to tell her how it worked didntmean he was wrong and she was right you like it she said accusingly you like thinking that you re a horcrux what the hell was she talking about he d have to be pretty messed up to feel good about this situation you couldntbe more wrong he said am i or am i right on the mark she asked you love that this is all about you admit it you love how important this whole damn situation makes you feel it only you who can defeat voldemort only you have the power to win this war you love the thought that you re such a big scary wizard that voldemort had to make you a horcrux because it was the only way he thought he could stop you ginny what the hell is wrong with you that you cantjust have hope you say you want to survive this but i see no proof of that all you talk about lately is when this is over when you re gone maybe you re ready to give up and lie down but i not and i refuse to let you do this to yourself what about the rest of us harry what about me she yelled so stop feeling sorry for yourself already and quit being such a selfish little bastard she turned around to leave harry grabbed her left hand she slapped him across the face with her right one he let her go too shocked to speak and she stormed out of the room he didntknow where any of that had come from the things she d said it sounded like she d been holding it in for months she probably had but where did she get the right to say any of that to him maybe he acted like a prat sometimes but he d never done or said anything with the intention of hurting her or making her feel bad and anything he ever did he did it for her whether it rubbed her the wrong way or not mr weasley miss granger said mcgonagall her voice breaking the thick silence that had settled in after ginny left please escort potter back to hogwarts and see to it that he remains in his bed until someone tells him otherwise he didntneed ron and hermione to follow him and treat him like a bloody infant he would gladly go back to hogwarts it sounded a hell of a lot better than staying in the same house as ginny no he would much rather go back to his hospital bed and feel sorry for himself like ginny said he was awfully good at it how dare she say those things to him she had called him selfish in the same breath as she d asked him what about me what about her it was only some time later when he suddenly felt sensations of guilt and anger separate from his own that he realized he could once again sense ginny but he couldntbring himself to care and so he closed his mind to her and went to sleep she d called him a selfish bastard and he fully intended on proving her right when he awoke ginny was sitting beside his bed what d you want he grumbled if she realized that he was being miserable on purpose she said nothing a part of his was still furious with her though in the foggy moments that followed waking from a deep sleep he couldntremember why i dontthink you re a horcrux she said not because it scares me to think about it and not because i would die if it was true i just dontthink you are he sat up he wasntsure if he was talking to her yet he didntreally know how to go about this he honestly couldntremember a time when she d done or said the wrong thing in an argument but he was pretty sure that that was what had happened this time and he was pretty sure judging by the way she was in front of him looking embarrassed and friendly that she knew it was this her way of apologizing and if it was should he even accept it he reminded himself of all the times he d been a git and she d forgiven him maybe he d never said anything as hurtful as what she d said to him but then again maybe he had there were times that he thought he understood almost everything about ginny and then there were times when he had absolutely no clue what she liked and didntlike why not he asked she leaned back in her chair the other night before you got hurt voldemort had somehow gotten into your mind right yeah said harry so i felt it too she said and he felt a wave of guilt hit him at the thought of ginny feeling pain because of her connection to him so if you think you re the horcrux because voldemort can possess you or whatever he does you re wrong because he did the same thing to me that night and tom did it all the time when i was little that doesntmean i the horcrux maybe maybe he can just do that sometimes to people harry didnteven know what to think anymore if he was honest with himself he no longer felt as sure of everything as he had before going to sleep he d been so positive that he d figured out the big secret and now he didnteven know what was worse he didntknow if he was relieved or not if it turned out that he was the final horcrux at least he would know what the final one was but if he wasn t it would most likely be for the same reasons why the snake wasn t right and that would put him right back at square one this war wasntgoing to last forever voldemort wasntgoing to hold off and give harry time to figure everything out for himself what little time he had left was ticking away and he could do nothing especially not when confined to that bloody hospital bed he figured he could probably stand to talk to dumbledore and see what his thoughts on the situation were but at the same time he could remember the anger he d felt earlier at dumbledore and it worried him to think that dumbledore new answers would evoke that same response in harry maybe harry admitted he didntknow if he was right but that didntmean he thought he was wrong he could think of a lot of reasons why he was the horcrux still there were a lot of other possible explanations for all of his ideas he supposed the only way he would know for sure would be to find the snake and kill it if nagini really was the final horcrux harry would have quite a time getting to that stupid snake he was in for several obstacles but then again wasnthis whole life just one challenge after the other he was ready for this fight he was going to give it everything he had and there were times like right now that he felt certain he would win he would give ginny and ron and hermione and everyone else the safe life that they all deserved he knew that it mattered to them if he survived and he knew that it should matter to himself but looking at the big picture harry couldntreally be bothered with the idea of his death he found it hard to see a problem with it especially when his dying meant he d be saving so many other lives in the process he moved over in his bed and ginny climbed in beside him just as she had many times before it hurt him to think that she d felt the same sort of pain that he had when voldemort had found his way into harry mind it occurred to him that voldemort probably knew about harry and ginny connection now how else would one explain trying to invade one person mind and ending up in another s how many times would ginny be hurt because of harry she had already felt so much pain whether directly because of harry own stupid actions or because of someone else reaction to her relationship with him harry said he loved her and he did as best as he could at least but how could he justify putting someone he loved through all of this it wasntright ginny he said i love you i love you too she said i know but listen he began and then paused was he really going to say this and what would she say in response this isntgoing to be easy it just going to get harder and harder and a lot more dangerous voldemort there no way we can hide our connection from him anymore i dontthink so if you if at any time you think you want to walk away i would never hold it against you he was fairly certain that she would never voluntarily leave him but at the same time he wondered if it was because she didntwant to or because she felt an obligation to stay there came a point where everyone ultimately had to put their own interests first where a person had to stop being a team player and make decisions based on what they wanted and needed for some people like tom riddle and snape and the malfoys that time came quickly much quicker than it did for people like dumbledore and mcgonagall and sirius when would that time come for ginny she turned her head and her eyes met his i hate that you just said that she told him but he was too tired to fight with her and maybe she felt the same way because she closed her eyes and relaxed against him this is suicide he whispered sometime later she said nothing and he realized that her deep even breathing meant that she was asleep he eventually drifted off to sleep as well his dreams filled with images of the dozens of ways ginny could be tortured and killed because of him review disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter forty six the last marauder harry opened his eyes and saw ginny watching him hi she said softly hi how long was i asleep i not too sure she said i woke up maybe ten minutes ago harry strained his neck to look around d you think anyone came in to check on us probably not said ginny i really doubt anyone in my family would ve come through here and left without waking me up and making me leave you alone he rolled onto his side and looked at her well leave it to me to pick the girl with six older brothers he said quite seriously pick oh no i dontthink you picked me at all harry raised an eyebrow so what exactly do you think happened he asked she shrugged no really i d love to know what going through your mind her eyes sparkled careful what you wish for she thought and even the sound of her voice echoing in his mind sounded sweeter than he d remembered it how had he functioned properly without their connection for as long as he had when i was little she said i heard your name and your story and i decided i wanted to meet you one day she smiled then i was ten i saw you at my house and i decided that i really really fancied you yeah oh yeah i didntknow why just then but i guess i had good instincts because it six years later and i still get butterflies when you walk into the room harry wondered if she ever felt embarrassed when she said things like that hearing it made him feel like such a git he wondered if hermione ever bothered ron with things like that things that were nice and loving and he wondered if ron ever felt completely uncomfortable they were blokes though they werentsupposed to be mushy were they he wondered if there had been situations in the past where ginny had expected certain things from him that he hadntdelivered there must have been millions of them did she care was she unhappy or did she just realize that harry wasntgood at showing that sort of stuff and when i was eleven you saved my life and i decided you were my hero she continued then i was fourteen and i decided i didntwant to be that girl who was pathetically obsessed with you so i fed hermione some line about being over you and then i dated michael for the hell of it hermione told me that you know he said i ll admit that i was awfully relieved she smiled and i dontblame you she said the only person worse than me was colin harry laughed so keep talking right so then i was fifteen and dating dean he had a few flaws but flaws can you give me a few examples harry asked enjoying this now dean was sort of his mate but he was ginny ex boyfriend and that automatically pushed him into the bastard category in harry books well for one he wasntyou that is an awfully big flaw he joked it bigger than you d think she said honestly and at first i was able to overlook his flaw but then i started to notice that you had a habit of watching me in the common room at night harry felt himself blush oh it okay she said i only noticed because i watched you in the common room too so we re both pervy stalkers then guess so she laughed i didntreally know what if anything was going to happen with you but i knew it couldnthappen with dean still kicking around i decided to dump him i decided i was going to make you want me and then i decided that to do that i would hang around you more even though that also meant hanging around ron and hermione and they both gave me a huge headache because of all that lavender business harry grinned nobody knew the headaches his friends could cause better than he did he was glad that rubbish was over and even though ron and hermione still fought a ridiculous amount it was different than before and harry liked it quite a bit better this way my plan worked and you fell absolutely head over heels in love with me so you see you didntreally have any choice i made all the decisions and i think we both know that once i decide on something nothing can get me to change my mind harry rolled his eyes a thought struck him something humourous and he suddenly wanted to share it with ginny remember how dean kept putting his hand on you and helping you through the portrait hole bloody annoying ginny said i couldnttake it anymore right he said well actually i was going out the portrait hole under my invisibility cloak one night while you were coming in and i accidentally brushed against you i guess you thought it was dean because i heard you yelling at him for it as i left and the next day hermione said you two were broken up he smiled whoops he said innocently just as well she said with a smile i mean we would have had to break up eventually why i had to end up with you didnti she asked dunno he said thoughtfully you think you did yeah she said i think i did you might not end up with me though harry said knowing he would get hell for saying it but also knowing that it was time they had it out i might not harry no he said and he sensed the light relaxed feelings of their previous conversation change into impatience and frustration and something else something that felt an awful lot like despair i being realistic ginny i haventgot my fingers crossed under this blanket that it going to happen but it might it probably will you denying that and refusing to even consider it wontchange anything then because he was still a little mad at her he said and you getting mad and hitting me wonteither ginny eyes flew to his cheek i sorry about that she said really i am but you you just came in and threw so many things at me at once and you were fighting for it so hard i just i dontknow i hit me he supplied she blushed i shouldnthave and i shouldnthave said what i said either about you wanting all of this i don t he said because he could see that there was still a little bit of doubt etched on her face he sighed i canthelp it this war is what i about but gin you you make me want more than this for me and that huge it doesntsound that way a lot of the time she said what do you want me to do he asked you know i not like that like what she demanded she shifted away from him and got out of bed hopeful optimistic well yeah he said sitting up i dontlook at situations and think how can i make this better i think what are the ways that this can go even more wrong and maybe that really bad but it kept me alive so far but i cantpretend not even for you worst case scenario isnthypothetical anymore it this this is war full out war voldemort got death eaters and dementors and merlin only knows what else this is the absolute worst case scenario do you get that yes but it doesntseem like you do you say you re ready and you want to fight but then you re back here and whispering in my ear that everything going to be fine when it won t you dontknow that it wontbe she said accusingly just like you dontknow otherwise he countered he sighed and rubbed his forehead with his hand i think what do you think she whispered urging him to continue i think that the chances of everyone making it out of this are a lot less than you re willing to admit and i think you realized that a long time ago ginny cleared her throat maybe she said slowly we should stop talking about this maybe i should go she said we can talk later she kissed harry cheek and left and he knew that there would not be another discussion he was both pleased that he d gotten her off of his back and worried that he d given her even more to worry about but she d started it back at the burrow hadntshe december seemed to be warmer this time around than in the past but maybe that was just because the stone walls of hogwarts castle had always been so cold at night and the burrow was always a little too warm harry kicked off his blankets and got out of bed careful not to wake ron he stumbled down to the kitchen to get a glass of water and that was when he saw it a movement past the window his fingers wrapped around his wand harry gritted his teeth and went to the door he stepped outside and found nothing nobody no sign of anything but harry knew what he d seen and he knew that he wasntgoing to allow it to happen not at the burrow it was unacceptable something small and furry brushed past his bare foot and harry was ready there was a blue white light and then the tiny rat was sprouting human limbs morphing into the impossibly disheveled form of peter pettigrew harry potter wormtail gasped what the hell do you think you re doing here he demanded you have no right to come back here after all you done his hands were on wormtail neck his fingers pressing and squeezing and choking but he couldntstop he wouldn t h harry please h have mercy mercy harry spat did you have mercy when you sold out my parents when you framed sirius when you sliced my arm for some blood so you could bring back voldemort i did you have mercy when you drew your wand and killed cedric diggory he continued not caring that wormtail face was bright red now not caring that his nasty little fingers were clawing at harry s begging for air that his name you know the boy you killed two years ago he relaxed his grip then because he wanted to hear what wormtail had to say for himself i yes yes yes yes wormtail gasped i know but please have mercy mercy i will i promise harry said he saw wormtail relax and he felt a new sense of loathing course through him i ll make this quick like you did with cedric wormtail eyes widened again please no i made a a mistake a mistake repeated harry that all it was to you i ve made many mistakes so many mistakes harry wormtail wheezed your p parents i did a terrible thing you think james was the b best friend i ever had harry so so understand and and forgiving your father he would have spared me he w would have forgiven me shown me m mercy harry nearly screamed wormtail didntget to talk about james or sirius or anyone else he pushed wormtail harder against the side of the house his wand was at wormtail neck now and it felt good there this should have happened ages ago why hadntit why hadntharry made it his top priority to find wormtail who cared about bloody horcruxes when wormtail was still alive and doing so much damage then i guess i not as much like my dad as everyone says n no harry you dontwant to do this donttell me what i dontwant to do he yelled and he was positive at least one of the weasleys would hear him and come to investigate but he couldnteven begin to care wormtail had sold out his parents it was his fault sirius had spent over a decade in azkaban for something he d never done something he would ve never even thought of doing he deserved to be punished to suffer he shouldntget to take the coward way out this time he could turn wormtail over to the ministry but there were probably a ton of wizards on the inside who were working for voldemort and the dementors were no longer under the ministry control no matter who harry handed him over to wormtail would be free within days f forgive me wormtail pleaded but there was no forgiving left in harry for this poor excuse of a wizard wormtail deserved nothing harry owed him nothing he wasntone of his dad best friends he wasnta true marauder he was worthless and despicable and a murderer i can h help you i can tell you all about wh what the dark lord is planning i can he couldntlisten anymore his head hurt and his blood was boiling and wormtail needed to shut up harry couldntstand to hear one more word the pressure was building and building and building down his arm and into his itching fingertips his wand was still there digging right into wormtail throat he felt it again that same urge he d felt when he d had draco in this position and he could do nothing to stop himself avada kedavra it was so green so blinding that harry was certain someone would wake up he could feel the panic rising the need to hide what he d done he wouldntbe able to stand it if mr weasley came out to see what the commotion was and saw harry now but at the same time his heart was pounding his mind was racing there was a feeling like nothing else coursing through his veins it felt good too good to ignore the shame was there but it wasntregistering the way it should have the way it probably would have before he backed away and went to the only person he could trust now remus awoke to someone calling his name harry registered in his mind but remus could not come up with a logical reason for why harry would be at grimmauld place in the middle of the night professor lupin he heard harry call unless there was trouble at the burrow and harry had escaped to headquarters for help but that wasntright if something was really happening at the burrow harry wouldntrun and abandon the weasleys he would stay and fight he would get himself killed professor he pulled himself out of bed and ran to the doorway in here harry appeared panting and barefoot clutching his wand remus feared the worst molly was dead or arthur ginny what is it he asked i i need your help harry said i need you to come to the burrow with me right now but we cantwake the weasleys okay said remus just let me change into there no time insisted harry please something wasntright here harry wasntright he was up to something or this wasntreally harry but could harry be polyjuiced for someone who lived such a dangerous life it was rarely harry stuck in precarious situations lately when would the death eaters have gotten the opportunity wormtail came to the burrow harry said dropping his eyes to the floor and i i just need your help with something peter remus asked you left him alone who watching him ron nobody watching him said harry remus felt something inside of him shift peter couldntget away not again not after everything he d done to the marauders sirius and james had been the best friends anyone could ever ask for and peter had ruined both of their lives he d betrayed them all remus wouldntlet him slide out of his grasp one more time what he cried we have to go he ran back into his room and grabbed his wand what were you thinking he going to he not going to do anything harry said stiffly not if we act quickly he said rushing past harry and toward the staircase remus said harry and suddenly something was different remus stopped moving his legs nearly buckling under the weight of the truth he understood that when he turned around again he wouldntsee his best friend son the one who laughed and played quidditch and carried himself just as james once had he would see someone he didntrecognize someone capable of awful things and surely this was not the same child he d held in his hands hours after his birth this was not the boy he d promised lily and james he d look after if anything was to happen to them the one who always listened with wide eyes as remus spoke of his parents i dont i dontknow what to do with him remus swallowed and they returned to the burrow in silence where is he remus asked when they were finally standing in molly kitchen outside that door and to your left harry answered go up to bed he said i ll take care of things harry nodded thank you remus went outside and stood before peter almost expecting him to spring to life and make a run for it he d waited so long to have peter in this position he d dreamt of it for years but it didntfeel nearly as good as he d expected and he knew that sirius and james were not together somewhere slapping high fives and with that thought the last marauder picked up his wand and pointed it at the remains of a wizard he d once called a friend he shivered this really was the coldest winter he could remember review disclaimer i dontown harry potter for katherine 02 01 06 we miss you like it was yesterday chapter forty seven the letter ginny awoke exactly eight hours after she d gone to bed feeling refreshed but unsettled she couldntremember having any nightmares but she frowned just the same knowing that she d had a dream about harry and that it hadntbeen good she couldntremember any of the details but something wasntright and why did she get the awful feeling that something bad had happened here last night she wanted to ask hermione if she felt something too but judging by the sound of water running through the pipes overhead hermione was currently in the shower shaking off all negative feelings she dressed and went downstairs the burrow was decorated for the christmas season and nothing put ginny in a better mood than seeing the mistletoe hanging in the kitchen doorway she d have to remember to get harry under there later good morning she said brightly coming into the kitchen someone in a good mood mr weasley remarked not looking up from his copy of the daily prophet yeah said george since when are you a morning person leave her alone boys lectured mrs weasley i think it lovely good morning dear so tell us gin what did you do last night that put you in such high spirits fred asked raising his eyebrows in a rather suggestive manner does it have anything to do with why harry so bloody tired this morning asked george ginny felt her cheeks heat at the look her mum shot her only joking of course george continued dontworry mum why i bet harry and ginny mum ginny whined why did her brothers always have to pick on her and harry leave your sister alone mrs weasley said automatically and ginny thought it was somewhat sad that telling the boys to leave her alone was just a reflex by now dontyou have anything to say about this ginny asked ron and what would you like me to say ron said his mouth full yeah said fred i bet his girlfriend would rather read a book than shag him anyway mr weasley let out a snort from behind his paper ron ears turned red and he slammed his fork down onto the table all right all right said mrs weasley looking at her husband disapprovingly this is certainly not talk for the breakfast table honestly i dontknow where you boys learned this i swear that i tried to teach you lot manners goodness only knows where they ve gone she sighed you boys can clear the table when everyone finished we ve got to get to the shop said george you should have thought of that before you starting giving your sister a hard time for nothing my arse fred grumbled what was that mrs weasley demanded nothing he said quickly and then dropped his eyes to his plate good morning hermione said cheerfully entering the kitchen and kissing ron cheek earning a snigger from fred what with you birds this morning george mumbled did some sort of cheering charm get shot around your room during the night gin ginny rolled her eyes and dove into her breakfast she really was starving and if harry didntcome down soon she was going to eat his food too speaking of harry where was he she glanced at the clock and frowned harry really not up yet she wondered aloud that git said ron bloody miserable this morning nearly bit my head off because i asked him if he was coming down to breakfast or not ginny frowned that really wasntlike harry he was hardly a morning person and he often snapped at ron but something about what her brother said sounded off perhaps harry wasntfeeling well i passed him on my way down he was headed for the shower and he looked a little worse for wear everyone even mr weasley glanced in ginny direction this time ginny rolled her eyes and stood filthy perverts she muttered i going to go check on him and i leaving my plate here especially for you george lovely george grumbled as she left the room when she made it up to ron bedroom she found harry bed empty she knew that he was still in the shower but she really wanted to talk with him something about this entire day wasntright and surely he could sense it too what else could explain his absence at breakfast and shortness with ron his wall was up and even after several polite but insistent attempts to have him lower it it remained intact she sat on his bed for a long time longer than it should have taken harry to shower she wished she knew how to apparate she d just pop herself down there and bust in on him she smiled at the thought and stored that idea away for a day that she was able to do just that it about time potter she said when he finally entered his room i ve been waiting for you oh was all he said okay she thought maybe a different approach will work better you didntcome down to breakfast nope he said he closed the door and lost the towel he d tied around his waist she averted her eyes as he dressed even though she didntreally have to because it felt more like looking at a stranger than her harry just then is everything all right she asked yeah are you sick no are you capable of saying more than one word at a time she said raising her voice in frustration he looked up at her and shrugged dunno she didntsmile but judging by his reaction she didntthink he d really expected her to you re being a real arse right now she said for no bloody reason sorry he said but his voice went up slightly at the end as if it was more of a question than an apology what going on with you nothing he said she was about to absolutely lose it on him when he decided it was in his best interests to say more bad sleep missed you last night yeah she said and she hated the smile that crept onto her face it very cold without such a hot body wrapped around me well he looked sideways at her what with all the one word answers he teased and there was a smile on his face for the first time all morning dunno she said smirking at him you re being a real arse right now he said in a high pitched voice that she assumed was supposed to be her own maybe you should come over here and discipline me you d like it too much she smiled innocently he sat down on the bed beside her and kissed her it started off soft and slow but quickly turned into something more when harry hand made contact with the flesh of her stomach it burned she gasped against his mouth and he clearly misunderstood what it meant he dragged his lips to her neck and moved his hands higher stop she said he didn t harry stop her skin felt like it was on fire she tried to move away from him but there was nowhere to go what the hell was he doing stop something finally seemed to click in harry head that combined with ginny kneeing him in the stomach got him to roll off of her what the hell was that she cried jumping off the bed and glaring down at him ginny he gasped his hands over his face wow wow i sorry i dont i dontknow her skin throbbed she lifted up her shirt and gasped at the sight of her red raw flesh what she said what did you do i sorry he repeated harry look at me harry looked at her and cursed did i do that he asked guiltily moving toward her she felt her heart beat faster in fear could he really do something like this without realizing or or what he known all along she immediately hated herself for even thinking that of course he hadntknown why would he intentionally do something like that he reached out to touch her skin and she took a fearful step back what if it hurt again his face fell i had no idea i was doing it he said firmly his eyes big and worried i i know i was short with you before but you do know that i wouldnt of course you wouldn t she said she wondered if her voice sounded sincere enough did he believe her did she believe herself i can heal it for you he offered truthfully she wasntsure if she wanted to feel his hands on her right then she didntwant to leave for fear of upsetting him but she thought she was going to be sick if she stayed there any longer the room felt like it was spinning i she choked out and then shook her head maybe we should go to mcgonagall why asked harry i can do it it just a small healing spell dontyou want to know what caused it you think mcgonagall will know he questioned if i cantfigure out how to control it how is she supposed to be able to i dontknow said ginny but you hurt me doesntthat concern you even a little bit i said i was sorry he whispered i know that you are she insisted but but you didntstop i would feel better if we went to mcgonagall or even lupin just someone who knows what they re doing harry appeared to be waging a war inside himself between his guilt for hurting her and his anger that she didntseem horribly forgiving even though he d apologized and apologized fine he said his guilt winning over and where do you two think you re going demanded mrs weasley harry and ginny stopped dead in front of the fireplace we re just going to headquarters for a bit said ginny we need to ask remus something added harry he coming over later said mrs weasley surely it can wait mum said ginny we re perfectly capable of flooing to headquarters what could happen mrs weasley looked as though she could name a hundred different things i dontthink this is up for debate young lady relax mum said charlie coming up behind her harry bit his lip there really was something about charlie that he didntparticularly like perhaps it was charlie blatant dislike for harry and ginny relationship i ll take them mrs weasley turned to regard charlie well she said i suppose it would be all right if you went with them what said ginny harry didntknow what to say if charlie came with them he d obviously expect a full explanation for why they had to go see remus in the first place and telling him that harry had hurt ginny would not be smart if harry wanted to live past christmas really said harry we ll only be a few minutes it no big deal then it no big deal if i come charlie challenged harry shrugged in defeat no he said i guess it not ginny shot him a look but what could he do they went to headquarters with harry holding his breath hoping for a way to distract charlie so he and ginny could talk to remus in private remus was the first to look up his eyes met harry s and harry could feel that there was something different between them now harry he said whatever he intended on saying next was lost when he spotted ginny behind him ginny hello and charlie what brings you all here a tall woman with lime green hair turned away from her conversation with tonks charlie she said her accent was thick and harry thought he recognized it from somewhere cassi said charlie harry remembered her now she was part of the order in romania what re you doing here i ave come to viseet tonks cassi explained we ave many theengs to discuss she smiled and changed her hair to dark purple zis is better no charlie grinned in a way harry had never seen before ginny caught his eye and raised an eyebrow harry merely shrugged and looked back at cassi just the distraction he d been looking for and you ave brought arry before he could brace himself cassi had flung herself past charlie and over to him she kissed both of his cheeks though her lips landed dangerously close to his own both times and when she pulled away from him he saw that both weasleys were glaring in their direction and you cassi said ignoring the look on ginny face you must be geenevra ginny looked somewhat taken aback at the use of her full name er yeah that me and who are you cassibellaunus predoviciu she said that quite a mouthful said ginny folding her arms across herself call me cassi and call me ginny charlie as told me so much about you geeny cassi said and ginny to her credit nodded politely how lovely cassi turned back to charlie harry sensing the moment was upon him looked at remus can ginny and i talk to you he said in private remus nodded and the three made their way out of the kitchen i ll come too said charlie why dontyou stay here with cassibacknuts ginny said sweetly you had better be nice to her charlie said sternly lowering his voice to keep cassi from hearing and you had better keep her off my boyfriend she countered why trust issues asked charlie he glanced at harry who glared at him he lucky he a weasley harry thought if he wasn t i would punch his bloody face in ginny rolled her eyes and followed remus into the other room harry locked his gaze onto charlie s and there was an understanding between them that charlie was going to do his best to keep harry away from his sister and harry was going to seriously harm charlie if he so much as tried so remus said when they were alone what can i help you two with there we have a slight problem said ginny we were hoping you could solve it for us she looked at harry we were you know kissing earlier he said and my hands burned her skin remus raised his eyebrows burned her skin he looked at ginny can you show me ginny blushed and lifted up her shirt harry nearly winced at the sight the normally smooth flesh of her stomach was nearly raw could you heal it she asked harry said he could but i just wanted to show you first harry really doubted that was why she wouldntlet him heal it he suspected the real reason was that she didntwant him touching her again but it hadntbeen his fault he would never could never hurt ginny not intentionally anyway he d probably indirectly hurt her a million times but even that killed him inside sure remus said he pulled out his wand and muttered the spell ginny rubbed her stomach and smiled thanks we er dontknow how it happened she said i mean harry obviously wasnt trying to do it of course not said remus he looked at harry any ideas if i knew he said we wouldntbe here well said remus i certainly not an expert when it comes to wandless magic but i d guess that you ve understandably had a lot on your mind this morning and all that extra emotional energy released itself in er negative ways harry nodded ginny gave him a strange look and just what have you got on your mind this morning harry ignored her thanks for your help we d better get back to the burrow before mrs weasley comes over here to make sure we haventdied he said simply quickly before remus had another chance to bring up the previous night right said remus his eyes showed that he disapproved of not telling ginny the truth but he also seemed to know that it wasnthis decision to make i ll see you both later tonight then harry ginny said i asked you a question what he asked he should have known by now that playing stupid never worked with her what did you have on your mind this morning nothing important he said making his way over to the fireplace charlie was wrapped up in conversation with cassi and didntseem to realize that anyone else was even in the room well it was important enough to burn me harry sighed that wasntmy fault he said even though it probably was i know she said do you of course she said but i can tell you re keeping something from me and i deserve to know what the hell is going on there are some things he said that i just canttell you about that i just wonttell you about he went back to the burrow then knowing that she would continue to bother him but also knowing that his resolve would not crumble like it usually did if he could help it he would never tell her ginny didntneed to know nobody outside of himself and remus needed to know he and ginny had already been through a trying couple months and he suspected that her finding out what he d done would have detrimental consequences to their relationship it wasntthat he was ashamed because he wasn t he d had reasons valid reasons for doing what he d done but he knew that nobody else would understand he d done the right thing and he really didntfeel like putting up with anyone who was willing to say otherwise he d sat up most of the night thinking about what had happened and he knew that he didntregret it he couldn t wormtail had sold out his parents he was the one who had tipped off voldemort if he hadntdone it everything would be different literally everything harry would have parents he wouldnthave grown up with nothing but a few pathetic pictures to reference every time he forgot the exact shade of his mum hair or his dad eyes and sirius would still be alive his parents would have their best friend harry would have a godfather someone to go to when he needed advice about girls or pranks would sirius have had a son of his own or remus would there have been a whole other generation of marauders to cause trouble at hogwarts had that been the plan before everything had gone to pieces around them wormtail was the reason harry had spent ten years of his life locked up in a cupboard under his aunt stairs he was the reason harry would never meet his parents he was the reason harry would never get to celebrate a successful prank with another of the marauders sons if peter pettigrew hadntdone what he d done harry couldnteven think about it anymore the fact that wormtail had been walking around breathing as if nothing had ever happened it was something that had been eating away at him since third year if he hadntstopped sirius from killing pettigrew when he d wanted to if he hadntgiven him the chance to escape if he hadntbeen such a fucking idiot wormtail would have been taken care of a long time ago sirius could have died knowing that he d avenged his best friends instead harry avenged sirius and his parents and remus and even himself he could never feel sorry for what he d done because to him wormtail had been living the last sixteen years on borrowed time anyway a week later ginny was drifting off to sleep when she heard it tap tap hermione was the first to realize what it was oh she said there an owl at the window let it in said ginny she didntrecognize it and so she assumed it wasntfor her perhaps it was for one of her brothers but nobody had answered at their windows but when the window opened it flew straight past hermione and went to her this letter for me she asked the owl who hooted in response whose owl is that inquired hermione dunno ginny said she untied the piece of parchment from the bird leg she patted its head and it bit her fingers ouch unfriendly little bugger arentyou the owl hooted disagreeably and flew off wait dontyou need my reply but the owl was gone ginny rolled her eyes and unrolled the parchment the quidditch stands noon tomorrow ginny recognized the scrawl it was the same handwriting that she d found on her graded potions essays from first to fourth year who it from asked hermione um luna she said quickly no wonder the bird was so spotty look at its owner ginny smiled faintly the parchment feeling thick between her fingers so what does she have to say not a lot said ginny just that she doing well and that she misses us she hopes to see us soon i doubt she ll be seeing us anytime soon said hermione is she expecting a reply er no said ginny she just replying to a letter i sent her she faked a yawn right well i off to bed close that window would you goodnight can i go to hogwarts ginny asked her mum the next morning mrs weasley blinked why do you need to go there harry there she said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world and i d like to see him see him when he gets home then she said she sighed that wasntgoing to work okay that not the real reason why i want to go then what is well i want to borrow some books you know since i technically should be in school right now just because hogwarts is closed doesntmean i should let my brain rot does it mrs weasley smiled at her you must really need to see harry if you re willing to make up a lie like that she said ginny blushed i ll be very quick i promise all right go if you must but try to be home in time for lunch her heart started beating faster in her chest really i can go and i dontneed to bring charlie or anything silly like that is there a reason why you should she shook her head of course not i ll be with harry and mcgonagall it doesntget safer than that you know she left then knowing that she wouldntbe able to go through with this if she looked at her poor mum a second longer she shivered as she walked through hogwarts it was hard to remember a time that students and laughter filled these corridors it seemed like it had been abandoned for years but she could close her eyes and remember shuffling past these exact portraits on her way to her next class she could recall running through here trying to get to the common room before curfew was over and the way her heart used to jump into her throat every time she and harry roamed the castle in search of a deserted classroom her footsteps echoed and she knew better than to worry that someone would catch her this wasntthe same as sneaking down to the kitchens after hours with harry the only two people in the building were both too busy to notice her she passed by the great hall and could hear them practicing she wanted to poke her head in but knew better if she didntwant to get caught she couldntgive herself an opportunity to be caught was she really going through with this it was awfully cold outside but the fact that she was breathing in fresh air was sweet enough to make her forget all about the way her teeth chattered she caught sight of hagrid hut and wondered if he was still occupying it she d been to hogwarts a handful of times since the end of term but she hadntseen him once harry said he used to have tea with hagrid when he came to train but he hadntmentioned anything in some time the pitch seemed bigger than she could remember it she looked up at the rings but it was hard to remember a time that she d been up there on her broom had it really only been seven months since gryffindor had won the cup since harry had kissed her in front of all those people she sat in the stands just as she had for her first four years at hogwarts only this time she was not waiting for a glimpse of harry on his broom she kept her wand clenched in her hand and tried to shake off the feeling that she had walked directly into a trap you re late she didntknow where the voice came from but she was pleased that she hadntjumped at the sound of it she didntneed him knowing how nervous she was sod off i right on time she said she heard him sigh dontjust sit there like a bumbling idiot get under here before someone spots you ginny finally caught sight of him underneath the stands she scrambled to her feet and joined him all right why d you call me here i have a proposition for you he said i dontcare she said determined to take control of this meeting do you have any idea what harry would do if he found out i was talking to you believe me weasley you care about what i have to say did she or were death eaters going to jump out at any minute and nab her she couldntdecide if she trusted him or not why should she but then again what he d done for her in the past hadntgotten himself any further ahead in this stupid war she had no reason not to at least hear him out i listening she said she took a deep breath and tried not to let him see how nervous and vulnerable she was if there was one thing she knew for certain about severus snape it was that he did not miss an opportunity to make a gryffindor squirm under pressure there are some things that i just canttell you about either harry she glanced back at the castle she wished she hadntcome but if whatever snape proposed would help harry she was obligated to at least explore this possibility review disclaimer i dontown harry potter i realize that this chapter will seem super rushed and that because it was between my exams and the fact that i going through a period where i really dontwant to write anything in the just going with it universe at the moment it was hard to write even this much if i get a review from anyone saying something along the lines of lyke omgz pleeease dnt quit dis storyyyy i promise i ll scream chapter forty eight led astray i dontknow if there were so many ways for ginny to end that sentence if i can trust you if i should do what you re asking if this is worth it if there even a way out of this now if i ll be able to live with myself if i turn and walk away she sighed she had to do this for harry what if you re wrong about this i mean harry seems to think that he the horcrux she said she knew she d make a mistake the second after those words left her mouth did she forget who she was talking to snape would probably eat that up but he didntseem fazed in the slightest yes well said snape leave it to potter to make absolutely everything about him ginny bit the inside of her cheek she didntthink she could stand hearing all the negative and cutting things snape had to say about harry but she knew better than to attempt to set snape straight but at the same time her heart was jumping did snape know something she didn t something harry didn t what do you mean she asked and it was impossible to sound nonchalant harry not a horcrux snape scoffed no he said harry potter couldnt handle being a horcrux but the truth was that harry could handle a lot more than anyone probably even she gave him credit for ginny bit her lip in indecision i dontknow about this i have neither the time nor patience for your games but do you really think it the snake she asked ignoring him why should i believe you why how can i be sure that i not walking into a trap if i go with you you will be walking into a trap he said sounding frustrated do you listen to anything why would you try to help us she asked why would you just call a meeting with me and offer up a horcrux without even wanting anything in return i was merely passing along information and making an offer that i feel would put the both of us a little further ahead in this situation why are you trying to help harry why wouldnthe answer any of her questions with actual answers i am not trying to help potter said snape just because i do not root for harry potter to win doesntmean i root for him to lose ginny frowned you cantdo that though you have to pick a side clearly he said it would appear that i do not this is war she told him there has to be a winner and a loser and you have to pick a side and stick to it no matter what the outcome you cantjust float around in the middle like some sort of snape narrowed his eyes at her the way he had in so many potions classes and she could do nothing but fall silent and blink stupidly how many horcruxes are left he asked ginny shook her head she d been admittedly pretty stupid so far but this was one piece of information she knew she couldntdivulge no matter what the circumstance you arenttelling me everything so i going to give you the same treatment she said his eyes bore into hers dark and cold and it was only after he d broken the contact and smirked that she realized he d probably been reading her mind since the minute she d met up with him i going to need an answer he announced she gulped and closed her eyes if i say yes she said slowly what going to happen i ve already explained it well explain it again there was silence for a long time ginny wondered if he was even still there but she didntwant to open her eyes this was the only way she knew how to prevent him from snooping around in her mind and getting even more top secret information from her if you agree to come with me snape began and she realized though not for the first time that the sound of his voice made her skin crawl i ll send a letter to potter telling him to come to hogsmeade if he ever wants to see his girlfriend again he ll spot the chance for heroics and come running i can ensure that nagini will be there and all potter has to do is recognize the opportunity and why do this questioned ginny what are you getting out of it my loyalties as of late have been questioned snape said with great distaste if i can make it look as though i ve taken it upon myself to deliver both you and potter to the dark lord i should be able to eliminate any doubts at least for the time being it sounded reasonable but ginny was so far out of her element right now that almost anything sounded reasonable she was considering his proposal she was literally moments away from agreeing was she out of her mind what if snape was lying what if he and the other death eaters had concocted this plan and she was falling for it as expected what if the plan included having snape save her back at the manor just so down the road they could ensure another encounter she put her wall down if she could just reach harry and tell him all of this he could talk her out of it he d never let her do this but he was busy training and so he didntput his wall down and he didnttalk her out of it and it resulted in ginny opening her eyes and agreeing harry didntrecognize the owl but he recognized the handwriting he didntunderstand what this was about was it some sort of stupid joke a stupid attempt to lure harry away from everyone else so voldemort could face him one on one he could have screamed maybe he did mcgonagall came over but his fingers had curled and the letter was crushed in his fist he threw his wall down but ginny didntrespond bugger she d been trying to reach him earlier and he d been too distracted with everything to answer her what if she d been trying to get through to him and tell him that she was in trouble what if she wasntanswering now because she was knocked out or stunned or dead mcgonagall said nothing more and merely followed him he led her to the burrow because all of those awful things could have been happening but there were also other solutions ginny could have been sleeping or simply angry with him for not answering her earlier if he had learned one thing from all these training sessions and battles and order missions it was that he couldntdive into situations head first it was hard to believe even for himself but harry potter was actually starting to get a tiny grip on his emotions where ginny he asked mrs weasley the second he saw her he d thought he was calm but his voice shook and every muscle in his body felt tense his hair was standing on end why wasntginny in the kitchen was it merely that she was upstairs or was she in serious danger and harry was being a fucking useless prick mrs weasley head shot up too quickly this wasntgood she at hogwarts she said she with you it sounded like she was trying to convince herself she not with me harry said fuck this was so not good she was never at hogwarts she has to be there mrs weasley insisted didntshe see that harry wasntkidding that fighting harry on this wasntdoing anything but wasting precious minutes i watched her floo there she said she was going to see you miss weasley did not come to hogwarts mcgonagall said we were what going on asked ron he and hermione came into the kitchen ginny gone harry said what they said at the same time ron pried the note from harry hand and cursed as his eyes flew over the words and he took in their meaning hogsmeade this is snape handwriting noted hermione she put her hand over her mouth oh what demanded harry last night she got a letter from someone said hermione she told me it was from luna but she didntlet me read it and she was acting strange and went to bed immediately after hermione disapparated before harry could even connect the dots on where she d gone she returned with a letter of her own here it is the quidditch stands noon tomorrow she read why the hell is ginny getting letters from snape harry yelled as if the others had the answers and why is she going to hogwarts to meet him i will gather the order together mcgonagall volunteered there no time harry said mcgonagall turned to him ready to argue or lecture him or do a million other things none of which were going to help ginny he shook his head go hurry mcgonagall left mrs weasley was running into the other room calling for charlie harry said ron can you get her if we go now harry said misunderstanding no said hermione with your mind can you lower your wall and get to her harry was taken aback how do you know about but the answer was quite clear ginny had told them obviously how could she do that who else had she told hadntthey agreed to keep it a secret he closed his eyes was this really the time to worry about that his wall had been down for several minutes now and he d gotten nothing from ginny yet i trying he said but i not getting anything she probably stunned she had to be stunned because if she wasntstunned that meant she was either dead or purposely ignoring his attempts to reach her and both of those options were inconceivable but was it all that hard to imagine that ginny would be purposely ignoring him after what she d done snape hadntabducted her from the burrow he d contacted her with a time and a place and she d gone why how could she even think it would be a good idea she had to have known that she d end up in trouble she was in trouble wasntshe yes she was in grave danger because there was no other possible explanation snape was the enemy snape had taken her so he could lure harry there and then he would try to kill them both that was the only logical thing but what about ginny behaviour was logical soon the order and the weasley family were all converged at headquarters they were coming up with a plan a strategy they were dissecting both letters bit by bit but when harry looked at the faces of ginny brothers he knew that they were all thinking the same thing for one reason or another she had done this because of harry panic was a funny thing it was more than an emotion that reared up deep inside of someone it was a physical thing a living breathing thing that took up too much space in a room that ron was already suffocating in to begin with what could ginny have been thinking going with snape that was what happened wasntit he would feel awful if ginny had been snatched right out from under their noses through no fault of her own and everyone was silently blaming her and wondering what the hell could have possessed her to join snape nothing could get ginny to join snape there was more to the story something wasntmatching up ron knew his sister nearly as well as he knew himself they were weasleys and maybe they did unreasonable things from time to time but they didntrun off with the enemy the didntknow much but they knew where they stood in this war and they knew that disappearing with a known death eater was unacceptable and just bloody stupid in general no ginny couldnthave gone voluntarily ron had faith in his little sister she lost her head when it came to this war and she jumped at even the smallest chance to help harry but getting herself captured again didnthelp harry at all did it there was some other explanation for this madness something they were overlooking but even if it was the truth even if ginny had gone to hogwarts to meet snape she was in trouble now she was in way over her head she needed the order to help her she needed her family to help her and there was nothing ron wouldntdo to get her back every second felt like an hour did they really need a strategy couldntthey just apparate to hogsmeade and save his sister already this was bloody ridiculous ron kept his eyes glued to harry waiting for some sort of sign a change of expression a sigh anything that meant ginny was communicating with him merlin what if ginny was dead she wasn t she couldntbe right no harry would know harry would have to know when harry had been half dead ginny had known she d been a bloody mess because of it so all ron had to do was monitor harry and everything would eventually work out because harry didntknow what it was to fail especially when a weasley was concerned was there anyone in ron family that harry hadnt saved at one time or another we have to get to hogsmeade charlie said as if nobody else had considered this we need a strategy said tonks we cantjust go rushing in we donteven know what part of hogsmeade they re holding her in and we dontknow how many of them are there we have no idea what to expect let go said mrs weasley our strategies are usually shot to hell anyway we have to go get my baby we ll split up harry said charlie can take tonks kingsley fred george percy mr weasley and mundungus and spread out and look from the three broomsticks to zonkos ron hermione bill mrs weasley remus and professor mcgonagall will come with me we ll look past zonkos to the hog head to madam puddifoot s the second anyone sees anything or needs any help send up sparks like at the triwizard tournament sounds fair enough said bill no more talking let go hogsmeade was hell thinking back to the first time harry had ever come here it was nearly unrecognizable now everything was empty and deserted and dark they were the only ones there and harry tried so hard to remember a time that he had laughed with ron and hermione here shouting to hear each other over the sounds of all the other people around them it was so cold but harry couldnteven begin to feel anything but rage they d kidnapped ginny didntthey realize that harry was going to stop at nothing to get her back or at the very least that he was going to die trying they were all going to suffer for this for taking her and directly behind that thought was another ginny could ve gone with them voluntarily he never thought this day would come the day that he d actually have to doubt ginny on something that mattered but this wasntjust him overreacting and jumping to ridiculous conclusions she d gotten a letter from snape and she d of course recognized the handwriting just as harry and hermione had she d lied to her mother and slipped away to meet him those were all facts whether ginny had been ambushed by death eaters or had gone all on her own she was gone and it was up to the rest of them to save her had ginny voluntarily done this did she realize how much danger she was putting everyone in what reward could she possibly be getting out of this deal that would be worth potentially leading harry her family and the order straight into a trap madam puddifoot came into view and harry cringed at the memory of himself and cho in fifth year if they lived through this war and hogwarts reopened would ginny make him take her there and would he mind as much as he had with cho it felt as though it would be a million more years before hogwarts reopened and things went back to normal he probably wouldntbe around to see it but ginny would he knew she would she would live to see another hogsmeade weekend at hogwarts he would make sure of that because no matter how utterly stupid she d been to walk straight into this trap and no matter how much hell he was going to give her later she was still the only thing in the world that was worth him fighting for harry he nearly jumped when he heard ginny voice when had she put her wall down gin are you okay where the hell are you the shrieking shack i think ginny at the shrieking shack he yelled and took off in a run he couldnttell if the others were following but he didntparticularly care he didntneed them anyway the way his fingertips were tingling now he felt as though he could take out every death eater all on his own without even batting an eye i ll be right there you will wait what d you mean i on my way how many are there with you i dontknow about seven but there more outside they ve got something planned harry please dontdo something stupid dontworry he thought there nothing i could do that would be stupider than what you did ron struggled to catch up to harry and the rest of them struggled to catch up to ron they met up with the other search party outside of the three broomsticks she at the shrieking shack harry yelled to them as they passed charlie was behind ron instantly yelling back how the hell do you know that it occurred to ron that charlie was the only one who had questioned harry even though nobody else except ron and hermione realized that harry and ginny had a connection that allowed them to communicate in such a peculiar way everybody had followed without wondering how harry could have possibly acquired this new information they were less than a hundred feet from the shrieking shack when they met up with the first wave of death eaters ron eyes instantly searched the crowd of people for hermione but he didntget much time to look before he heard someone yell stupefy and everything went black so many things were happening at once harry didnteven realize that a curse had been thrown his way until he found himself being pushed to the ground snape collapsed beside him but wait did that make sense had snape just protected harry what the hell was going on he crawled over and shoved snape none too gently but the git didntstir bugger what was snape playing at by jumping in front of harry as if they were on the same bloody side as if either of them had any sort of obligation to the other he hated himself then because he was going to have to do something that he would probably hate himself for later but if snape had just intentionally saved his life he couldntjust leave without at least trying to help could he he knew the answer of course he could but he didntwant to and not for noble heroic reasons either even if this really was what happened harry still hated snape with every ounce of his being and he would not hesitate to do to snape what snape had done to dumbledore back at hogwarts but not now he refused to be in severus snape debt for the rest of eternity just as snape had once saved harry because he couldntstand the thought of being in james potter debt harry was going to save snape snape didntget to die like this he didntget to look like a good person he didntdeserve the credit he d get if everyone knew he died in a valiant attempt at saving harry potter from a nasty and apparently fatal curse he leaned forward and pressed his palm against his enemy forehead opening his eyes wider than ever and trying to remember everything he could from his training with mcgonagall things were so much harder to remember outside of the controlled environment of a classroom or private lesson honestly if his teachers were ever going to give a real attempt at helping him becoming a better warrior they should seriously consider simulating genuine battle scenes the next time they tried to teach him something at least then he d be able to know whether or not he was truly capable snape forehead was sweaty and greasy of course and harry pressed harder willing this to work he took several deep breaths and felt his senses becoming more acute he could nearly feel some of his energy draining out of his fingertips and into the bastard lying before him and when his former potion master opened his eyes gasping for breath harry removed his hand and left review and remind me that this shit is still worth writing even though this chapter was probably downright painful to read read the new one shots despondence and ashes disclaimer i dontown harry potter it six in the morning and i need sleep but my mind wants to write and there nothing i can do to talk it out of this my inspiration has returned to me though probably only temporarily in the form of my big brother who sees what everyone else chooses not to see and stays up all night watching lame 80s movies with me it amazing how it the little things that can restore my faith that there are still people out there worth loving i hope you guys are happy with this chapter and this story i ve told myself over and over that it doesntmatter that i writing this for me and nobody else but it does matter so much and it blows my mind that for every person out there sending me a negative email demanding an update there are five sending me messages saying i hope you re doing all right and update when you can if you can it so bad how we as humans have the undeniable tendency to focus on the negative and ignore the positive so please read this chapter and then get the hell off the computer and go focus on your own positives before they re gone love ps snape wasntbrought back from the dead because he wasntdead yet just close chapter forty nine hope it took ron a few moments upon waking up to realize that he was in the hospital wing at hogwarts alone where the hell was everyone how did he get here could he leave what happened at hogsmeade was everything over had he missed it what had happened to him was anyone here with him two voices cut through his thoughts hello he called he heard a squeal and suddenly his curtains were being pulled back to reveal hermione excited face she was standing over him her arm in a sling and a rather nasty looking cut on her neck but alive and that was really all that mattered you re awake she cried yeah said ron he managed to sit up with her help what the hell happened he asked and then a more important question is ginny okay and everyone else hermione nodded ginny appeared behind her looking completely fine and giving no indication that she d been held captive by death eaters mere hours before it was still hours right he hadntbeen out for days or anything had he he remembered being stupefied but that didntmean it was the only thing the death eater had done to him he knew only too well what they were capable of ginny he said and he reached for her before he could even think to order his arms to do it are you okay i fine she said she pulled up a chair beside his bed and pouted audrey wontlet me leave until she checked me out but nothing happened to me at all i promise where harry hermione shook her head at him as if he not only wasntsupposed to bring it up but should know why he wasntsupposed to ginny just shrugged it was either sit with you and be in the same room as me or do neither so he left but i sure he ll be back to see you just as soon as i allowed to leave he isnttoo keen on seeing or speaking to me at the moment what said ron you were captured by bloody death eaters and he wontspeak to you i wasntcaptured ginny whispered hermione cleared her throat and shifted uncomfortably you sorry what ron asked stupidly i wasntcaptured she repeated but ron had to have heard her wrong again because what he d heard didntmake any sense if ginny wasnttaken how else did she end up at hogsmeade with snape and the others then what happened he demanded snape and i made a deal she admitted i was to go with him and make it look like he d captured me you know to squash any doubts that he wasnta full fledged death eater and in turn he d give me a horcrux and you believed him he held up his end of the deal said ginny her eyes meeting his for the first time he was shocked at the anger he saw there he tried to at least but nagini hard to control and he couldnt there wasntthe right opportunity ron cursed i cantbelieve you would do that he said you almost got us all killed and for what you should know better than to trust snape how could you be so stupid harry has every right to be furious with you ginny jaw clenched for a moment it seemed as though she was going to say something of utmost importance but instead she stood up and left you can tell audrey that i fine and that i dontneed her to check me out she called over her shoulder to hermione hermione glared at ron how could you say that to her she deserved it said ron she made a deal with snape snape remember him the one who killed dumbledore the one who busted in on bill wedding he sighed how could she think any good could come from working with him i mean wasnthe the one who took her at the wedding what was she thinking was she thinking hermione shrugged i not denying that what she did was incredibly dangerous and stupid she knows that she could have led us to our deaths she feels awful but she thought she was helping harry by getting a horcrux and now he wontspeak to her she doesntneed you treating her like absolute shit too ron mouth quirked up he wasntsure he agreed with her but nothing made him smile more than hearing hermione say shit ginny returned home though it was the last place she wanted to be but it wasntas though anyone would disturb her here seeing as none of them would speak to her after the fight they d crowded around her and hugged her until she could hardly breathe and once her parents and all of her brothers minus ron who was still unconscious in the next bed had repeated over and over that they were so grateful she was alive they d begun to ask questions they asked so many but she couldntanswer any of them the way her family had hoped harry sat at ron bedside the entire time listening to ginny speak but seemingly refusing to look at her once she d told them her story and it was really only a fraction of the real story but they didntknow that harry had stormed out and then the rest of her family had left each wearing a matching mask of disappointment and concern hermione bless her had pretended to understand she d pretended that she didntthink what ginny did was the stupidest thing ever but hermione vote of confidence couldntcancel out the fact that everyone else hated her for what she d done ginny was starving she refused to think about this anymore until after she d eaten she turned into the kitchen and found her mother sitting with the twins charlie and harry ginny said mrs weasley her voice tight she didntlook at her daughter nobody else even attempted to make eye contact you should be in the hospital wing why so you donthave to face the fact that you canteven look at me ron awake she said he asked where you were harry harry said nothing he didnteven flinch at the mention of his name she stood there for another moment but nobody made any attempt to speak to her they didnteven ask how she was feeling it was strange that under any other circumstance she would have loved that her family wasntfussing over her like a baby and yet it was almost unbearable now fine she said ignore me but i went through just as much as you did today you know you dontget to do that harry yelled and ginny who had turned to leave stopped in her tracks you dontget to act like some sort of victim ginny i am a victim she said even though she knew with all of her heart that she wasn t you chose to put yourself in that situation he argued you let it happen do not act like you understand what happened because you don t you re right he said i don t i cantunderstand how anyone could be so fucking stupid charlie looked at harry and there was protest in his eyes but then he looked at ginny and it died away only to be replaced with disappointment then he dropped his gaze to the floor ginny wondered how long it would be before her brothers would be able to look at her again before her mother would take pity and say that it wasnther fault even though everyone knew that it was go to hell ginny spat and then trudged up to her bedroom she had no right to defend herself she had no reason to be angry and harry had every right and reason in the world to never forgive her for almost leading everyone in the order to their deaths she had told her family only a partial truth she d told them that snape had contacted her and that she d agreed to let him capture her in exchange for the final horcrux but that was all she d said she wondered if she should tell the truth the whole truth would it make a difference she wondered if she should tell her family about what snape had done for her at malfoy manor and that she really had no reason to say no to his latest proposition she wondered if they would understand if she explained that she d only done what she thought was best for harry and that surely they would have done the same for the loves of their own lives but hadntshe promised snape that she wouldntsay anything he d asked her not to tell harry about what he d done for her she didntunderstand why but for some reason snape hadntbeen comfortable with anyone especially harry knowing that he wasnta complete traitor to the order was it because he had to make sure his cover wasntblown or was it because he needed to feel like he was more involved with this war than harry was in that aspect how could he have been sure that ginny wouldnttell had he read her mind and seen for himself that she was perfectly willing to keep his secret or had he merely trusted her the idea of snape trusting her with something so important was laughable but then again the idea of ginny running straight to a known death eater and striking a deal used to be laughable as well she needed to contact him one more time she had questions that he needed to answer he owed her that much she d done just as much for him as he d done for her in the past they were even now they were equal and as his equal she deserved to be leveled with there was a knock on her door and her mind raced with the possibilities of who could be on the other side hermione most likely maybe tonks was it possible that her mum had come around she opened it and found the one person she would have bet it wouldnt be harry she said and in her mind eye she imagined him saying wonderful things she saw him apologizing even though he had nothing to apologize for she saw him taking her face in his hands and kissing her the way he used to so long ago back when they could snog for hours and it would be enough hermione still at hogwarts and wants a change of clothes he said he didntlook at her he didntreally give an indication that he was doing anything more than speaking to the door when had it come to this tell her to come get them herself she said and then slammed the door in his face he pushed it back open hard his eyes finally met hers and she couldntbreathe when faced with the emotions she found there all directed at her anger confusion and mostly betrayal she had seen harry look like this only a handful of times in the past and she had never before imagined that he could one day look at her in the same way she realized that she wasntangry with harry for treating her the way he had in the past day she had not given him the full story and therefore she had to accept that from his limited perspective she was in the wrong and he thought that he had every right to be angry if she was angry at him it was for the way he had been treating her before today how everything she did or tried to do for him went unnoticed and how she was constantly taking a back seat to this war it was always one thing after another it was more important for harry to look for horcruxes and go to order meetings and train than it was to spend time with his girlfriend ginny understood that voldemort was harry first priority and she mostly felt lucky to come in second but when the first thing on the list took up one hundred percent of his energy and his time what was the difference between being second and being last she vowed to herself that she would stop being harry girlfriend and she would start being ginny weasley she couldnteven pinpoint when she d stopped being herself and had started being all about harry again regardless of when and how it had happened it was clear to ginny that she could not expect harry to put her first until she learned to put herself first she felt her resentment for him melt away and it left her straining to feel anything for him in that moment it was a strange thing indeed staring at someone for whom she had felt nearly every possible emotion at one time or another and feeling nothing the look in his eyes didntchange but suddenly she could breathe again and it was both liberating and pathetic at the same time neither of them had their walls down but she knew that her next thought would be heard by harry regardless i know that we loved each other once but i think we ve lost sight of the reasons why so can we please just take a step back and forget about all of this and maybe eventually try to remind ourselves of everything else before it too late harry hand twisted on the doorknob i ll tell hermione he said quietly and then closed the door softly ginny put her hand on the wood wishing it could be the only thing between them i love you she mouthed but did she really she had always loved harry and she always would but was she in love with him she used to be she knew that she used to be and now it had been so long since she d been tested since she d had a reason to wonder she didntget butterflies in her stomach when he kissed her anymore was that because she was finally used to the look in his eyes when her body was pressed to his or was it because of something else something she d been aware of all this time but had been ignoring she knew better than almost anyone that it was so much easier to ignore a problem than to face it she looked around her room so many things made her think of harry did she love him because of who he was and what he made her feel or did she love him because he was practically a part of the family and it was what her mother had been wanting for years and years if she still loved him did she love him because it was easier than loving someone else ron never called her a slag when she kissed harry the twins never teased her about harry with the same intensity as they had michael when harry did something stupid and insensitive and she forgave him was it because she loved him with all of her heart and trusted him to never do it again or was it because their story was practically already written and she continually folded under the weight of her family expectations merlin knew her parents already considered harry a son and the perfect boy for their daughter and ron wouldntron love having harry as an official brother ginny pressed a hand over her eyes and lay on her bed she eventually fell asleep though she couldnttell for how long she awoke to the sound of three sharp knocks and then the smell of dinner that hit her when the door opened hey hermione said coming into the room are you all right i guess said ginny what are you thinking about i love harry ginny said her voice going up at the end the way it did when she formed questions i believe that you do said hermione ginny felt her friend body settle beside her own on the bed but what do you think i think i think i forget what it feels like to love him she said truthfully hmm why do you love ron she asked i mean how do you know that you do he makes me laugh hermione said and ginny could hear the smile in her voice he makes me forget that there a war going on out there he makes me feel smart ginny laughed you donthave to be around stupid ron to feel smart no hermione said fiercely not that kind of smart smart like capable like i can do anything like he ll be there even if i screw up she sighed being with him reminds me of every good time we ever had at hogwarts and here in the summertime ginny rolled onto her side and met hermione eyes lately being with harry reminds me of when i was six years old and crying because i wasntold enough to go out flying with the twins she said that doesntsound like love hermione admitted ginny shook her head no she whispered it doesn t mcgonagall called an order meeting the next day and it was the only reason harry was in the same room as ginny he didntknow what was going on with them nor did he want to know a part of him wanted to take the easy route and stay angry with her and another part of him wanted to explore why he would rather blame her than question himself but he was afraid of what answers he might find and so he focused on other things he thought of his anger for ginny and realized it was the first time he d felt much of anything for her in some time he d felt guilty after he d burned her a few days ago and he d felt scared and concerned after he discovered that she was missing but wouldnthe feel both of those things even if the person was not ginny he tried to remember the last time ginny had made him feel something that nobody else could he drew a blank and although he realized that part of this was because of his current feelings for her he also realized that this blank was not a very good sign was it possible for him to fall in love with a person and automatically love her forever or did he have to work at it would he have to fall in love with ginny a million different times in the beginning he could have sworn that he did just that everything she did had made him love her more intensely had they reached some sort of quota or had they both tuned out along the way had it been both of them or was it just him to blame for all of this had ginny gone through with this crazy deal with snape because she loved harry and thought she was helping him or had she done it because she was desperate for him to notice her amidst all the talks of horcruxes and voldemort and order missions guilt settled low in his stomach and transformed his anger for ginny into anger for himself he was not ready to talk to her yet he was not ready to jump back into what they d had together but he knew that he would eventually and he knew that he would have to make sure he d sorted out his own problems before he attempted to take on both of theirs i starving ron announced can we get on with this ron had only just been released from the hospital wing and nobody knew better than harry how restless one could become being confined to a bed for any period of time just what have you got scheduled for later that so important asked fred nothing said ron irritably i just dontwant to hang around here all day waiting for everyone to find a seat around the bloody kitchen table well said george there are some people who apparently would rather peel of their own skin than sit beside each other so we ve got to allow time for a little bit of rearranging said george all of harry self control went into keeping his eyes from seeking out ginny who was sitting down at the other end of the table far away from the rest of her family the spell over her parents had broken and they were no longer treating her as if she had the dark mark burned onto her arm her brothers were speaking to her though mostly only to comment on the weather or to ask her to pass something at dinner percy was the only one of her brothers who spoke as though nothing had happened and harry found himself warming to percy in a way he never had before though he d never admit to it he was glad that most of the awkwardness was over for ginny and her family just because he wasntready to revert back to the way things had been with ginny didntmean he didntwant everyone else to be there for her all right said mcgonagall i suppose i should thank you mr weasley for your patience ron ears turned pink no problem professor he muttered really take your time his stomach rumbled and he frowned to start things off i am pleased to see that nobody was seriously injured despite the heroics attempted by several of you at hogsmeade harry could feel mcgonagall eyes on him and he could not for his life figure out which part of his actions she found to be the least bit heroic as for how this situation developed in the first place ginny not talking said charlie i ve already said everything there is to say ginny said fiercely though he hated that she wasntoffering up as much information as she probably could harry felt proud that she wasntletting charlie walk all over her there appeared to be several people who took issue with this answer the room quickly erupted into argument and mcgonagall struggled to regain control very well miss weasley said mcgonagall we will move on she dropped the morning issue of the daily prophet onto the table i trust everyone had an opportunity to read the front page she said and everyone nodded harry frowned he stopped reading the daily prophet some time ago especially after his own name began popping up even more than usual but because of hermione and mr weasley tendency to discuss current events at the ministry he ended up hearing about the news each day at breakfast anyway it occurred to him that there had been no discussion today why harry reached for the paper at the same time as ginny he hesitated for a moment before shrugging and pushing it toward her he studied her face as she took in the headline and was shocked to see her eyes well up with tears i excuse me she whispered and then fled the need to go after her was overwhelming instead harry grabbed the paper and blinked down at big black letters that read severus snape found tortured dead i dontget it harry said he meant that he didntget why ginny was crying but the others seemed to misunderstand neither do i actually said hermione the article says that snape was tortured and then killed and it says bellatrix lestrange was the one to do it lestrange harry repeated why would she is it possible that snape wasnta death eater anymore asked bill i mean could he have tried to switch sides again and they caught him and killed him for it maybe it wasntreally lestrange who killed him harry said maybe the reporters at the prophet are just saying that to boost their sales there was a heavily silence for some time harry didntknow what to believe but he knew that there was no way snape would ever try to do the right thing and come back to the order after everything that had happened once a traitor always a traitor harry was so lost in thought that he almost didntrealize when the conversations began again is there anything else to discuss asked george we should probably be getting back to the shop fred said mcgonagall shook her head she appeared to still be contemplating the situation with snape no she said i believe that is all for now everyone stood up and began to make their ways out of the kitchen at least something good came from all this mundungus said cheerfully as he passed you wouldntbelieve the beautiful snake i ve got back at my flat what did you say harry asked standing up he reached out and closed his fingers around the man arm mundungus grinned you heard me he said snake skin and lovely snake skin at that very fashionable worth a bundle i bet wait where did you get it hogsmeade of course said mundungus caught him myself nasty bugger was slithering all over the place saw my opportunity and i took it harry felt his heart speed up was he the only one listening to what mundungus was saying how come nobody else seemed to realize what this meant was he losing his mind or was he the only one thinking clearly do you still have the snake he asked desperately or have you just got the skin nah said mundungus i ve still got the snake for now stunned it until i can figure out what to do didntwant to ruin the skin with any sort of curse you know could be worth a lot of money i suppose i ll have to do a bit of research on the subject yeah professor harry sputtered turning to face the others he he got nagini review disclaimers i dontown any of the harry potter characters chapter five the birthday what do you think about harry hermione asked two days later ginny gave hermione a curious look um i think he brave and funny and no no i mean in regard to him joining the order what do you think about that i i dontknow i suppose it a good thing he really excited about it and the order sure could use him said ginny it ll be dangerous yes but i think he can do it hermione considered her arentyou scared for him hermione asked ginny didntknow how to answer she would be lying if she said the thought of harry leaving her didntgive her an uneasy feeling in the pit of her stomach she was still afraid that he would die but she wasntbetting that voldemort would be the one to do it she knew harry and if there was one thing she knew for sure it was that he d never give voldemort the satisfaction of killing him but then again would harry pride hold up against someone as evil and powerful as voldemort he had killed other wizards who were far more powerful than harry potter his luck could only hold out for so long a new wave of anxiety washed over ginny as she imagined a life without harry potter no she said hoping hermione didntnotice the slight shaking of her voice i know that harry has to fight voldemort i ve accepted that we all just need to stay positive she sighed quietly and looked out the window of the burrow into the backyard harry along with ron and the twins was currently working up quite a sweat de gnoming the garden for the wedding well yes but what about everything else we have to survive the missions we have to get the horcruxes before harry can even begin to think about voldemort ginny nodded solemnly she had been told all about the horcruxes and what they did the night mcgonagall visited she was disappointed to hear ron hermione and harry talking about missions and how they d go off to fight side by side ginny would of course be left behind she always was she would ve been frantic with worry for the three having no idea what to expect on their search for the remaining horcruxes but she didntgive herself time to really think about it her fury overrode any other emotion when she imagined the three of them on another one of their special golden trio adventures she was angry that she wouldntget to come along and that she would yet again have to miss out on the fun because she was too young she didntunderstand it harry had been doing dangerous things since his first year at hogwarts and ginny wasnteven allowed to leave her house because she was only sixteen i not worried ginny said confidently perhaps more confidently than she felt speaking of harry what are we going to do for his birthday tomorrow hermione contemplated the younger girl question your parents have to attend an order meeting tomorrow night and i dontexpect we ll be left alone here so i not sure we might have to go with them to grimmauld place that ll be horrible ginny exclaimed we need to convince mum to let us stay here hermione nodded the two girls refocused their attention to the backyard where the boys were still working now shirtless due to the almost unbearable heat when are you and my brother going to get together asked ginny she didntwant to embarrass her friend but it was ridiculous to watch the two of them together completely oblivious to the other advances excuse me i dontknow what you re my arse you dontknow said ginny you two couldntbe more obvious about your feelings if you tried hermione blushed oh and i suppose you and harry arentbad either then ginny smile faded that right i know what going on with you two i not stupid you know hermione said matter of factly that day in the attic was completely tactless shut up ginny hissed turning a bright red you ve got to watch what you say around here you never know who got an extendable ear everyone is outside explained hermione and if your mum was listening she would ve busted in here the second the words left my mouth we werentdoing anything in the attic she lied we er we were running away from that awful ghoul that up there hermione raised an eyebrow and folded her arms against her chest clearly not buying into ginny story defeated ginny sighed and said we arenttalking about it until the wedding why if you re together why wait until the wedding to announce it hermione asked clearly not grasping what ginny had meant your brothers wontmind and your mum will be thrilled ginny looked down at her hands we we arentexactly d dating she admitted that what we need to talk about at the wedding hermione gasped quietly okay so you arentdating ginny shook her head but you what are you doing exactly i donteven know she looked back out the window and watched harry he was laughing at something probably the twins ginny thought he looked amazing when he smiled but you know what i dontparticularly care what do you mean inquired hermione you two snog but you dontdate and you dontmind pretty much hermione cast a disapproving look i know that i sound like a slag but i not i ve really fallen for that stupid boy ginny said laughingly he doesntwant to be open about our relationship because of you know voldemort this is the only way for the moment while ginny didntentirely believe her words she said them anyway hoping hermione would buy into them i love harry like he my brother said hermione but it sounds a bit dodgy is he taking advantage of you ginny giggled in disbelief merlin no if anything it the other way around she said and gave another small laugh after seeing her friend look of utmost shock ginny do you what kind of why are you doing this she sputtered ginny sighed and her expression turned serious she didnttake her eyes off of harry who along with ron was making a game of who could throw their gnomes the furthest look at him down there look at how happy he is she said if we re going to be perfectly honest here i dontknow how long that will last as much as we try to avoid talking about it hermione it getting closer what is hermione asked though ginny got the distinct impression she already knew the answer the battle i know what the prophecy said and i know that it would be foolish of me to expect harry to come out on top said ginny hermione turned her attention away from the window and refocused it on ginny but the redheaded girl continued to stare at one harry potter unless you know a place where we can get loads of felix felicis for free so we can give it to everyone before the battle we re going to lose some people maybe even harry hermione sucked in a breath and ginny pulled her gaze from harry to study her friend she looked positively mortified as if she had never even considered the possibility of losing harry before yeah maybe we ll get lucky and it wonthappen but there a good chance that it might i dontknow what going to occur but i know that if harry dies i ll always regret not being with him when i had the chance i have that chance right now and i taking it she explained but ginny what if it was ron ginny asked what would you do huh hermione said flushing ron and i arent bloody hell hermione give it up ginny sighed throwing up her hands i dontcare what you say you fancy my brother just as much as he fancies you i wonttell anyone but you might as well admit it hermione looked around the room her eyes coming to rest on the redheaded boy in the backyard his stature had changed since she had last seen him shirtless two summers before at grimmuald place where she had accidentally walked in on him changing he had developed muscle but hermione doubted it was from quidditch the duties of the players didntreally require a strong upper build in her opinion they mostly needed to grip the broom and not fall off balance and coordination were key yes but not necessarily muscle so where had he acquired it the thought of ron alone in his bedroom doing pushups was oddly enticing to her i suppose so she confessed turning a slight scarlet it about time you admitted it said ginny beaming she turned serious again now pretend that ron was the boy who lived pretend it was you who was in love with the chosen one what would you do if you were me did ginny say she was in love with harry i i dontknow admitted hermione looking at her hands it would be a terrible situation to be in i expect i d be a worried mess but would she do the same as ginny was would she really be able to be with ron without at least being considered his girlfriend sure she had kissed viktor krum once when she was fifteen but that didntcount the only other person she d ever kissed was cormac and they had been together at least for a little while she and ron had kissed as well but hermione didntcount those a peck on the cheek before a quidditch game a kiss on the forehead before bed and a kiss in the attic to prove a point didntmean anything to her i still cantimagine she saw a flicker of annoyance on the other girl face and you donthave to worry about it ginny said her voice oddly shaky because it only a hypothetical question but it real for me and harry we didntask for these circumstances but we ve gotten them anyway and we have to deal with them somehow ginny i understand but no save it ginny yelled standing up you cantpossibly understand you might ve been the cleverest witch at hogwarts but this isntsomething you can learn from a book you dontknow anything when it comes to love you dontget it you dontknow what i feel like right now and i pray that you ll never have to find out because it sucks with that she stormed off leaving hermione alone to contemplate what had just happened hermione wasntused to being told she didntunderstand something she especially wasntused to it being the truth she wanted to understand but maybe it was best that she didnt kind of like the time she wished she had been able to see thestrals sighing hermione got up and climbed a flight of stairs up to ginny room she knocked lightly on the door gin can i come in yeah ginny said quietly hermione walked in and looked at her friend who was lying flat on her bed and staring up at the ceiling i sorry for yelling like that i just very frustrated right now hermione sat on the edge of her own bed which was on the other side of the small room you were right i dontknow what it feels like to be in your situation i imagine that it d be terrible never knowing if his next fight will be his last it is but it not even that it wouldntbe so bad if i were at least coming with you to the fights because then i d know what was happening explained ginny since mum makes me stay behind i have to picture the battles in my head and every time i try to see it it so horrible and i go crazy with worry until you three are safe again hermione didntknow what to say in response perhaps you ll be allowed to come this time after all you re much older now and you re a clever witch ginny snorted you dontneed to worry about us so much you know i canthelp it she said i ve worried about you lot since my second year when everyone at hogwarts thought that sirius was a murderer and the three of you chased after him and peter pettigrew hermione was about to respond when the sound of mrs weasley calling dinner reached her ears and she and ginny both hungry from a hard day work of cleaning and tidying rushed to eat the first thing harry heard the next morning was the screeching of two loud female voices exclaiming happy birthday harry groaning harry pulled his blankets up over his head desperately trying to return to the state of sleep one that he could feel rapidly slipping away he heard footsteps beside him and the distinct sound of curtains being opened he shut his eyes tighter trying to block out the sunlight that was streaming in through the bedroom window hurry up and get out of bed came the unnaturally chipper voice that could only belong to ginny bloody hell harry just get up and get her out of here harry heard ron yell somewhere to his right ginny you re my sister and i love you but i need my rest and i wonthesitate to hex you this instant if you dontleave us to our sleep come along ginny i ll take care of these boys hermione said laughingly the next thing harry knew he was hanging upside down from the ceiling by his toe as was ron ginny had collapsed on harry bed in a fit of giggles and hermione was trying desperately to contain herself as well i thought you didntapprove of this spell ron barked who was blinking like mad against the invading sunlight you sure yelled at harry enough when he used it that doesntmean i didntmake the effort to remember it incase you two gits ever needed the extra lift out of bed she laughed harry scowled trying to ignore her clever pun and threw her a pleading look hermione do whatever you d like to ron but give me a break it my birthday traitor yelled ron hermione appeared to consider his plea and dropped him onto the bed he landed on top of ginny who was more startled than injured get off the poor girl and go clean yourself up mrs weasley is waiting for you downstairs and while it is your birthday i am under strict orders to do whatever is necessary to get you moving this morning harry uttered another groan before lifting himself off of ginny and helping her up alright there he asked she nodded and threw a quick glance at her brother before giggling and saying we ll leave you two alone hermione smiled but said nonsense with that she dropped ron onto his bed and scurried out of the room after harry and ginny when harry descended down the stairs and entered the kitchen the two girls in tow he was bombarded by redheads happy birthday harry dear mrs weasley yelled as she pulled him into a bone crushing hug after which fred and george rushed over and clapped him on the back bill who was still in town on official order business which harry was excited to discover he would soon be informed of and participate in lingered behind for a moment waiting for the mob to clear before greeting him in a way similar to the fred and george s after wishing him a happy birthday though bill said goodbye and disapparated out of the kitchen the six seven once ron finally accepted defeat and got up to embrace the day of them had a nice lunch around the kitchen table before giving harry his gifts he got an assortment of pranks and other devious and fascinating products from weasleys wizarding wheezes courtesy of george and fred a rather heavy book entitled defense against the dark arts volume iv ancient curses and how to deflect them from hermione a large box of chocolate frogs and other treats from ron an interesting quidditch book from ginny and a knitted jumper from mrs weasley thank you harry said bashfully but you really shouldnt there one more thing molly said jumping to her feet she smiled excitedly and pulled out her wand arthur wanted me to wait until tonight to give you this one but i can t i hope he ll understand she laughed is it alright with you harry harry looked at the other five wondering what the woman could be going on about um sure excellent she waved her wand toward the clock on the wall and two more hands were added one of the hands reading harry and the other reading hermione in fancy inscription both immediately pointed toward mortal peril something harry could ve done without but it was the thought that counted and the thought was not lost on him harry smiled at the woman who had become somewhat of a mother to him over the past seven years from sending him jumpers on christmas to inviting him into her home she was always warm and loving he felt a pang of loss in his gut as he wondered perhaps for the first time how different his life would be if he still had his rightful mother he had pondered this question over and over but never in regards to the weasleys or hermione if he had arrived at school that first day at hogwarts without a scar and with parents waiting for him to return for christmas and summer holidays would he have befriended ron wasntit mrs weasley mothering appearance and ron friendly if slightly twitchy and removed company at king cross followed by hermione barging in on them that began the trio friendship if harry had arrived with his own parents knowing perfectly well how to make it onto the platform would he have been the same to ron and hermione and all the other friends he had made throughout his time at hogwarts or would he have taken malfoy up on his offer and joined his ranks would he have even been offered a spot in malfoy group if he werentthe boy who lived he had always thought that he wouldnttrade his friends for anything but would he trade them for his parents would he trade them for the chance to be a faceless nobody instead of the chosen one the answer used to be simple black and white yes but now the lines had blurred and he wasntso sure what he would do he was positive he wouldntwillfully let go of his parents but he didntwant to think about all the people he d have lost if his parents hadnt been killed he shook his head clearing his thoughts his parents were dead they werentcoming back and he didntneed to worry for no reason for the first time in harry life he felt content with the circumstances under which he had been placed mrs weasley i he fell silent at a loss for words he would never be able to express his gratitude for the woman who took him in nurtured him and had not once rejected him though he landed ron and ginny in more dangerous situations than he could even count through it all she loved him as if he were her own son harry who ironically had been saved sixteen years ago by the power of his mother love had never been touched by that particular emotion since there was no love at the dursley house and no matter what terms they had left on harry was not anxious to ever return to privet drive he didntharbour any fondness for little whingingin any way actually he looked at hermione hoping for some help but she had tears in her eyes as she stared at the clock she rose from the table and hugged mrs weasley tightly harry deciding this was a good idea followed suit thank you so much said harry but you didnthave to oh hush now said mrs weasley you re my son harry harry simply nodded as she turned on hermione and i know that you already have a family dear but you ve still got a place in ours always both of you molly took out her handkerchief and her watery eyes met harry again you re a grown wizard now and and she looked down at her hands before giving a melodramatic sniff and rushing around to clear the dishes you lot ve grown up too bloody fast she sighed fred grinned and said now now mum george whose swig of pumpkin juice apparently went down the wrong way choked out dontget your knickers in a twist you ll always have georgie and me we re the best of the bunch y know as if on cue there was a small explosion from upstairs which harry guessed was a result of the twins they exchanged fearful looks before mumbling something about getting back to the store and disapparating before mrs weasley could stop them did you hear that ron hermione family now ginny beamed as the four entered the drawing room minutes later she and harry exchanged amused looks i suppose it was only a matter of time before it happened one way or another what do you mean by that exactly asked hermione shooting ginny a warning look oh nothing just that i figured you d be married into the family before you got officially added to the weasley clock laughed ginny she looked at ron who was seething at ginny comment marry into the family asked ron hermione you didnttell me you were dating one of my brothers the busy haired girl laughed and rolled her eyes oh didnti percy and i are actually having a double wedding with bill and fleur i thought i told you i ve always thought he was the most attractive of you lot what you think he attractive relax ron i only joking when ron gave a feeble laugh and started to change the subject she added of course he isn t i ve always fancied bill though charlie no troll either after ginny fit of giggles ceased she choked out now now hermione donttalk about my brothers that way they re yours too after all all of them hermione face held a rather curious expression for an instant before replying if you re right then i guess harry kind of like another one of your brothers ginny scowled and shot a nervous glance at ron who seemed oblivious to anything while harry gave his friend a questioning look and a nervous realization dawned on him when hermione winked in return so she said clearing her throat i trust you ll be taking your apparition test soon now that you re seventeen yeah i guess i will when are you taking it again ron dad taking me in about a week you re coming right harry nodded maybe you should consider shaving your eyebrows for the test so there no chance of leaving them behind he joked ron gave him an unappreciative look when do we begin looking for horcruxes he blurted out as soon as possible said harry as soon as possible after the wedding corrected ginny i ll hex all three of you if you leave me here alone to deal with phlegm harry laughed but ron shook his head and muttered something maybe you ll be able to come with us hermione suggested hopefully earning her dirty looks from both harry and ron she most certainly wont be coming her bother insisted why not ginny demanded perhaps you dontunderstand how dangerous this is but it isntsome silly game where i ll be able to protect you from getting hurt he said i dontneed you to protect me ron yes you do no i don t how d you know you ll be any better than i would be the only one of us who knows what a mission is like is harry or are you just assuming that you d be better because you re a male hermione and harry remained silent knowing better than to get in between the two when they fought they exchanged slightly worried slightly entertained glances when both weasley children got to their feet and started yelling in each other faces harry briefly wondered if mrs weasley would bother putting a stop to their arguing or if she was so used to it that by now she merely turned a deaf ear i not basing any of this on me being a male ginny i a better fighter than you that what i basing this on hermione not a male y know and she coming ron bellowed good of you to finally notice my gender hermione said dryly getting a nasty look from ron and an amused one from harry excuse me you re a better fighter ginny asked incredulously you re damn right i am that funny because now i might be wrong here but i distinctly remember you yelling something along the lines of accio brain at the department of mysteries scoffed ginny a load of good you did that night who was the one fighting on their broken ankle and who was the one playing with brains that wasntmy fault argued ron and i think that i did pretty well at hogwarts last month i did too you re still not coming ginny turned to regard harry arentyou going to say anything she asked he looked from one sibling to the other unable to determine where his true loyalties were he agreed with ron he didntwant her there but she did make a point when she said she a good fighter a battle was waged between his head and his heart and he didntknow which one he wanted to prevail he opened his mouth to speak but firmly shut it again and looked to hermione for assistance dontlook at me she said this is your call you re the one in charge he made a mental note to remember for later that he wasntspeaking to hermione i i dontknow he stammered averting his eyes from all three friends he didntwant to have this particular discussion and hoping to draw some sympathy from the fact that it was his birthday he said cantwe talk about this later all you ever want to do is put things off and deal with them later ginny growled her eyes alive with fury what that supposed to mean he yelled you know what it means now it was ron turn to sit back and watch the events that unfolded the expression on his face told harry that he had no idea what they were going off about but he now knew that hermione had been brought up to speed ginny save it harry she sighed she marched over to the door and before leaving muttered happy bloody birthday the dinner that night with harry ginny hermione ron arthur and molly was uncomfortable ron was not speaking to ginny ginny was not speaking to harry and harry briefly attempted to not speak to hermione all that could be heard was the clattering of plates loud chewing and the occasional haughty sigh any big plans now that you re of legal age harry mr weasley inquired after dinner that evening mrs weasley firmly stated he staying here of course harry i wouldntdream of letting you return to those horrible muggles and oh the thought of you at grimmauld place is far too unsettling thanks really but i was actually thinking of spending a little time in godric hollow before i settled down anywhere harry said oh molly said evenly her features calm harry couldntfigure out her true thoughts on the matter yes well you know there will always be room for you here if you want to come back she glanced up at the wall and harry followed her gaze looking happily at the clock in front of him this was by far one of the prouder moments in his life it was better than the feeling of catching the snitch during a gryffindor game against slytherin it was better than sending lucius malfoy to jail and it far surpassed his kiss with cho chang this moment was right up there with seeing the da members improvements and kissing ginny after they won the quidditch cup just as harry was about to thank them again fred and george appeared in the middle of the kitchen anyone fancy a game of quidditch george asked absolutely not mrs weasley said sternly no child of mine will be outside flying around in the open during times like these harry saw hermione beam as mrs weasley regarded both she and harry as her children molly arthur said not looking up from his edition of the evening prophet it about time now we should go right she said not turning away from the kids there an order meeting at grimmauld place tonight so you lot have two options you can either come with us to the meeting or i ll stay here and watch you harry felt that both options were a bit extreme but said nothing ginny glanced at him looking outraged and embarrassed that her mother would even suggest such a thing and said oi mum harry doesntwant to spend his seventeenth birthday at an order meeting even if it is in his own house then i suppose i ll stay here arthur you can go on both of our behalves why asked ron you arentold enough to stay home alone not under these circumstances mum fred and i are nineteen and all of us are legal but ginny we can manage things while you re gone george yelled fred added if something happens george hermione and i can apparate and ron ginny and harry can do side along apparitions so go on get to your bloody order meeting the ones we still arentallowed to attend because everything will be fine over here fred finished molly weasley looked at the children obviously debating whether to remain at the burrow or attend the meeting honestly mum if you know who wants to bust in here and kill harry it wontmake any difference whether you re here or at the headquarters george mrs weasley looked uneasily at them and turned to her husband arthur weasley glanced up from his paper and raised his eyebrows i think they ve all proven that they can handle it molly actually if anyone will need protecting it ll probably be fred and george he chuckled that true she agreed they haventeven graduated from hogwarts it like we re not even here fred muttered he waved his arms wildly trying to get his mother to look at him but it was to no avail and actually mum we came a helluva lot closer to graduating than these ones did george reminded her gesturing toward harry hermione ginny and ron molly waved them both off and sighed i suppose we ll be alright by leaving them here she said to arthur arthur turned to the kids remember the rules dontlet anyone inside without the secret question dontgo outside for any reason dontlet ginny use magic dontlet fred or george use their products these last two were instructed to hermione and if there trouble you all get out as quickly as you can dontstay and fight harry couldnthelp but notice the way mr weasley eyes lingered on him slightly longer than the others when he said that a few minutes and many promises to stay out of trouble later molly and arthur left fred and george turned to regard the others with satisfied smiles on their faces right well who wants to test some of our products fred asked hermione gave them a look okay okay how about we order up some er exotic dancers for the birthday boy george suggested ginny gave them a look fred grinned alright then where does everybody stand on firewhisky thanks for reading dontforget to review disclaimer i dontown harry potter so who else is super excited that this story will be over in a few chapters chapter fifty purgatory mundungus being mundungus it had taken quite a while for mcgonagall to convince him to give up the snake he d agreed eventually though harry didntdoubt that it was more out of fear of mcgonagall than out of any desire to do the right thing and when mcgonagall pointed her wand at nagini and did the spell when the spell identified that stupid snake as a horcrux and everyone watched as the final extra piece of voldemort soul was destroyed harry felt his legs give out and sank into the nearest chair he was not aware of everyone else clearing out and leaving him alone nor was he aware of the fact that surely hours had passed and he had not moved once he sat with his hands covering his face trying to familiarize himself with the strange too real weight that had settled itself firmly onto his shoulders how long would it be before he could remember to breathe on his own again before his hands would stop shaking enough for him to properly hold his own wand this was it there was nothing standing between harry and voldemort now there was no reason to sit back and watch as death eaters wreaked havoc on the world he could do something about it now he would do something about it desire and obligation were two separate things two opposite things harry had yet to meet a person other than hermione perhaps who took genuine pleasure from the tasks they were forced into performing and so it was incredibly fortunate miraculous even that the greatest obligation in harry life was also his greatest desire that which would give him the greatest satisfaction would also give him the most grief in order to avenge the ones he had loved and lost he would have to lose others whom he loved it was no secret that harry had been dealt a difficult hand in life but he had lately begun telling himself that it could be worse it had become his mantra he was an orphan who had grown up with terrible family but then again he could have been left without any family to protect him he had lost sirius the only father figure he d ever known but at least he had met sirius in the first place he had to fight voldemort arguably the most powerful wizard ever but he had a whole army of people who loved him and were willing to fight to the death with him it could be worse harry believed this in the same way he believed that he could actually beat voldemort he had no proof and surely no real reason to place any faith in the idea but it was the only thing that got him out of bed in the morning the surface of the table felt cool under his palm and as he idly traced the patterns he found he thought of everything voldemort had done not just to harry but to everyone to the witches and wizards who had been brave enough to stand up to him and even to the ones who had faithfully served him until they were no longer needed to the innocent muggles who didnteven get to choose a side how many children were orphaned just as harry was because of voldemort how many mothers had buried their children because of him for the past twenty years so many lives had been taken and even more had been destroyed as a result how many more would there be if harry didntact now what would the future hold for the billions of people who didntdeserve any part of this it came on so suddenly that it took harry breath away one moment he had been confident but concerned and the next he was overcome with a new intensity one that made his fingertips itch and his hair stand on end his chair scraped across the floor as he stood but he didnthear the awful noise that echoed through the kitchen when it did nor did he hear mrs black shrieks he walked to the fireplace and it was as if he was watching this scene unfold from outside his own body he could see the determination of his own stride and the way his eyes were so dark that not even ginny would be able to identify them as his he was going to do this he was most likely going to die trying but as long as he took voldemort with him he couldnteven begin to care and that was probably the cleanest ending harry could envision anyway ginny waited in the twins room for harry to come home it was hours before he came in and by then she was too exhausted from everything to even want to talk to him but he d spotted her and so she would have to spill her guts or strip naked and pass off her presence as an effort to seduce him into forgiving her and knowing harry it would be far easier to just explain the truth to him is anything wrong he asked no she said okay he said stiffly then what re you doing here she thought it was sad that neither of them could swallow their pride and apologize but even though she realized this she wasntgoing to give in it occurred to me that for two people with the ability to read each others minds we keep an awful lot of secrets she said he appeared to consider this and at his nod she continued so i ve come to tell you the truth about why i went to hogsmeade with snape harry demeanor changed at her words you mean you lied before ginny felt herself shrug this was where it would get tricky she d practiced this over and over in her mind but every line she d come up with had deserted her now i didnt lie she said i just neglected to tell you certain things that would probably make a difference in one way or another harry swallowed thickly go on then he said i know you arentgoing to believe it but snape wasnta death eater well he obviously was i mean she stammered but not really and he did kill dumbledore but it wasntfor the reasons you think it was dumbledore death was always a touchy subject with harry especially with what she was proposing and he immediately jumped to argue with her i dontwant to cast a silencing charm on you but i will if you dontlet me talk she threatened i need to say this he crossed his arms and she could almost feel him checking out of this conversation so hurry up and talk i want to go to bed she frowned at him but continued he was giving her more time to explain than she deserved and he hadntthrown her out of his room yet which was a good sign when i was at the manor snape saved my life she said a ton of different death eaters would come down to where i was being held to torture me but when snape came in he didntdo any of that rubbish he helped me when the order got there he came to me and told me what was going on he left the door open for you surely you remember that and what about the fact that i wasntrestrained when you got to me didntyou think that was strange harry stubborn eyes did not leave the floor and it led ginny to believe that he did indeed remember all of those things and could not come up with a reasonable explanation for any of them snape is the reason i made it out of there alive harry why didntyou tell me this before asked harry his voice was confused but softer and she was thankful he asked me not to she explained he didntwant you knowing why not i dontknow she admitted it wasntas though he d answered any of her questions when they d been in contact i think maybe because he wanted to keep you guessing about what he was doing and maybe because he didntwant you to think he was doing you any favours harry cursed but he did if what you re saying is true at least and if he really is dead now that means he died with me in his debt no she said if anyone owed him anything for what he did it was me and that why i went to hogwarts when he sent me that message and you didnthave any suspicions of course i did she insisted i had a million a giant part of me expected to be ambushed by death eaters before i even got to the quidditch stands but i still had to go why he stared at her confusion all over his face it blew her mind that he still didntunderstand that there was no limit to what she would do for him i suspected he wanted to talk about you i went because i wanted to hear what he had to say and i glad i did he explained that people were starting to doubt his loyalty to voldemort and he promised a horcrux if i went with him and pretended that he d captured me it was a win win situation but it could have been a trick i knew that she said but i also knew that if he was telling me the truth you d end up with the last horcrux she wanted to reach for him but it still didntfeel right she wondered if there was enough time for them to make it right or if it was too late harry all you ve ever wanted is to end this and all i ve ever wanted is for you to be happy i didntcare what i had to do as long as i could help you i still dontcare i know that we got nagini and that means everything i did was worth it even if you hate me now harry put his hand on her cheek and she knew that she wasntthe only one feeling strange about them i donthate you he insisted i could never hate you i was just angry i not trying to get you to forgive me she said to be honest i dontthink there anything to forgive i didntdo anything that you wouldnthave done if the situation was reversed am i right i dontknow muttered harry it was a hideous lie and they both knew it if i was in your position and you had the chance to help me in a huge way would you do it even if it put you at risk of course i would he said but it different it not ginny i not a child she cried harry looked sideways at her what you treat me like i haventeven finished first year or something she said no i dont you do even if you dontrealize it and i think that one of the reasons why things are so bad between us lately things arentbad between us he said halfheartedly arentthey harry sighed and sat down on the bed i dontknow if i can believe that snape was innocent all along maybe i letting my personal feelings get in the way but i canthelp that he said but i believe that you believe he was that all i can say really that all i wanted to hear she said softly sitting down beside him i sorry that i didnttrust you he told her i sorry that i gave you a reason to not trust me harry stared at his hands what the hell is going on with us he asked ginny shook her head i dontknow things dontfeel the same anymore do they no he said and i dontknow what to do about it neither do i harry looked up at her and she was shocked at the worry she found on his face i cantlose you but part of me feels like i already did when i wasntlooking you didn t she insisted and you won t ever now that the horcruxes are out of the way things are so much more serious and there isnttime to sit around and try to figure things out she rested her head against his shoulder she d been waiting for him to apologize and be the first to admit he was wrong but hadntshe d swallowed her pride and given in before he had just by approaching him tonight it was funny how things happened without her wanting them to and yet everything ended up being okay perhaps their relationship was stronger than either she or harry realized gin he whispered if i die and with his words whatever small piece of mind she d had vanished you are not going to die if i die he began again i dontwant to leave things unfinished what do you mean i mean things could be over at any time now tomorrow even as much as we try to prepare for it none of us are ever going to be ready he admitted i dontwant to die but i really dontwant to die and leave you here with all these questions if there anything you want to know just ask me now okay she tried blinking away her tears but it only made things worse she hated that harry continued to bring this up but what she hated even more was the fact that she suddenly did not feel so confident and reassured of their fates when ron told her that nagini had been destroyed it had made everything real in a way it had not been before it was amazing to think that she d been living at the heart of this war for so long and had been able to stay blind to most of the facts the odds were certainly not in harry favour and she had managed to remain oblivious to that until tonight she thought of every time she d yelled at her family for treating her like some na ve little girl and she felt shame in the realization that a part of her had been acting that way all along she tried to imagine that the war was over and harry had been killed she knew that despite harry efforts things would always feel unfinished she would spend the rest of her life wondering about a million different things should she ask him now or was he only offering to give himself peace of mind she could only ask him so much she could ask about the big things could you see us having kids one day but she d never know the little things like whether or not those children would have had his eyes or his smile or his utter inability to accept even the smallest of praises would you want to be a professional quidditch player or even a teacher at hogwarts but she d never know the joy of cheering after he won his first world cup match or of listening to him talk about the funny thing that happened in class one day would we buy a house close to the burrow or move away like bill and charlie but she d never know what colour their bedroom would be or if she d be more inclined to cook if she had her own kitchen to mess around in would they put a quidditch pitch in the backyard and would hermione let ron bring their kids over to play on it okay she said say the war is over and you re alive what next she kept it vague because she wanted as many different answers as he could give her if i d survived he said and was she the only one who realized he was talking in the wrong tense we would ve gone back to hogwarts i would ve waited for you to finish and then i would have made you marry me and i dontknow what i would ve wanted to do with the rest of my life but having you with me would ve been enough harry answer was both exactly what she needed to hear and the only thing she couldntbear to know i wish things could work out like that he said they still can she vowed and she knew then that she would give it everything she had harry was not the only one who would be fighting for his destiny the final battle would end it all it was almost funny to think that all of this could be over at any given time that the only thing keeping harry from his destiny was a variable which he could now control he thought back over everything that had ever happened and knew that every single second of his life had been leading up to this this battle would be the culmination of everything harry wasntan idiot he had known for quite some that this would have to end soon but the horcruxes had always been a factor they had always been the last hurdle to overcome they d always been the first thing on his mind and they d always kept him from getting ahead of himself and now all six of them were destroyed there was nothing else to do but go after voldemort was he ready a part of harry thought that perhaps he would never be but there was another larger part that insisted he was and really wasnthis whole entire life just preparation for this perhaps he was not more powerful than voldemort but did that mean he couldntwin if he was faster if he was fiercer he could very well do it and who said he wasnt more powerful than voldemort anyway there was no denying the fact that harry ability to do wandless magic had far surpassed what anyone had expected and even he didntknow what he was still capable of doing he had so many questions and perhaps the most frustrating and yet the most gratifying this was that he was the only one with the answers from here on out harry answered to no one he was the only person with even a hope of defeating voldemort hermione could no longer nag him about all the things he had to get out of the way before fighting he had done everything he had to do there was a great moment where he was aware of all that he had overcome all that he had accomplished and he allowed himself to feel every ounce of pride he deserved to feel he opened himself up to every emotion he could muster both positive and negative just incase the next sunrise brought the final battle with it and he would never have another chance to feel anything at all there were so many things that had spent too long lurking in the corners of his mind he did not want to spend another minute avoiding anything he settled into bed and instead of clearing his mind as he usually did he worked on bringing forth every memory he had one by one he examined each from every angle taking from it what he needed before storing it away forever more sometime in the night he decided that he was grateful for his life he loved his parents and would always wish to know them but if he hadntbeen alone that day at king cross he might never have met the weasleys some of his best memories were of summers and christmases spent the burrow he didnthave the red hair but mr and mrs weasley had always loved him just as much as they did their own children he couldntimagine not going down to breakfast every morning and seeing mr weasley reading the paper or mrs weasley making enough food to feed thirty people instead of just ten or eleven what would he do without the twins and their inappropriate jokes where would he be without best friends like ron and hermione or ginny his hand on mrs weasley clock might ve been pointing to mortal peril but as long as it was there he couldntbegin to care about where it pointed he did not sleep that night but when the morning came it was as though he had slept a hundred years his soul felt purged for the first time in a long time harry thought that he could die content leaving everything exactly how it needed to be short but i think i actually like it review disclaimer i dontown harry potter this took way longer than it should have but i sure you all know that i went one direction then erased it and went another and then still wasnthappy and re wrote it a few more times i basically got nothing except a headache i kept putting it off in the end i ve decided to just post the first half so you at least have something to read while i re work the second part i definitely apologize chapter fifty one the beginning it happened in february there was no warning no signs or perhaps harry whole life could have been looked at as a warning everyone was prepared for it as prepared as anyone could be for the event that would alter the world as any of them knew it to say that they d spent the last few months getting ready was an understatement and in many ways it was also a gross exaggerated lie it seemed almost as though everything that had ever happened from the first day of hogwarts and onward was just one drill after another meant to prepare them for this the troll on halloween fluffy the chamber of secrets the department of mysteries the battle at hogwarts the fight at the wedding order missions horcrux missions they had all served the same purpose in the end hermione had been preparing for this day her whole life she truly did believe that even before she had ever heard of hogwarts or voldemort or harry potter she had been preparing herself for what would happen today it was destiny she tried to imagine where her life would be now if she d never gotten her letter and drew a blank she was meant to be a part of this fight and though she was a girl who had spent her life believing in science and circumstance rather than fate she knew that it was fate and fate alone that had led her all the way to this moment her elementary school teachers and her parents and even the authors whose books she had read they d all taken it upon themselves to pass along information so she would be able to fall back on it one day in an emergency this was the day the emergency if she had ever learned one useful thing in her life she was going to need it to come out today her hands shook at the silent suggestion that she d wasted her time harry and ron had been out training gaining experience that would give them a great advantage in this fight and where had she been during all of that she d been back at the burrow with her nose in a book what if she d been wrong there were some situations that simply could not be simplified by any amount of book smarts and cleverness what if this was one of those very situations she wished that this life could be laid out in front of her like one of her books she wished she could pretend that the story was already written and that there would still be thousands of pages left to live out after this chapter was over she needed to know if it was going to be a happy ending or not for the first time in her life hermione wanted to read the last page first she felt helpless which was perhaps the worst feeling in the world she was at a point where envisioning her loved ones happy and safe and alive years into the future was the only thing that kept her going and also the only thing that she had no right to do but years and years from now when voldemort is just a chapter in the history books and harry potter is even less the smell of an old dusty book will still bring hermione back to the moment that both started and ended everything something had changed on that morning and even before lying in bed the previous night things had been different for ron and on one level or another they had all recognized what it meant the air seemed thicker somehow charged with something nobody could even begin to understand hermione would later refer to it as magical and he would question whether or not that word held any significant meaning at all within the wizarding world here hermione said i found a few more that i think we could stand to go through again ron looked up at her and groaned when he saw the thickness of the books she was carrying over she dropped them onto the table with an echoing thud wait a second he said glancing at the topmost book we ve already looked through these which is why i said we should go through them again she said sitting down at the table and diving into one of them we donteven know what we re looking for said ron was he the only one who realized that when i find it i ll know she said she didntsound as sure as she had yesterday or even the day before though there isnttime for this there has to be she argued her eyes still scanning the pages before her we just we have to find something there has to be something here that we ve overlooked something that will help harry two weeks ago when hermione first announced to him that she was going to read every single book in the hogwarts library because she knew that the key to helping harry was in one of them he d offered to help her but if he was honest with himself he knew that this was ridiculous and a total waste of time ron knew the truth and the truth was that all of this was up to harry now and no one else since destroying the last horcrux he d spent practically every night tossing and turning trying to figure out the right way to help his best friend and as corny as it sounded ron knew that the best shot harry had at winning this was if harry overpowered voldemort by channeling the positive emotions he had for everyone there were no ancient mysterious spells in a book buried in the back of the restricted section that would do the trick it didntmatter how well harry had mastered his wandless magic ultimately it would come down to the one and only thing harry had that voldemort could not even understand love the only way for us to help harry now is to just be there when it happens he told her that isntgood enough she insisted slamming the book shut and reaching for another ron grabbed her hands before they could snatch up another book he forced her to look at him you re right he said it not good enough but it all we can do it all we ve ever been able to do ron harry isntlike us he pressed he he the reason all of this is happening he the reason everyone kept going for as long as they have all we can do is fight to keep as many death eaters away from him as we can because he the only one who can do anything about anything now and i know that it makes you feel useless because it makes me feel the same way but even if just being there isntgood enough for us it always been so much more than harry has ever asked for her expression changed her features tensing and relaxing at the same time as if she was realizing for the first time in her life that she was wrong and didntknow how to go about it it occurred to ron that this probably was the first time hermione had ever been wrong she started to say something but tonks burst through the doors and put an end to their conversation you ve got to get to headquarters she ordered them why asked ron but if the sudden spike in his heart rate was any indication he already knew death eaters are here just outside the gates harry said coming in behind tonks the wards arentas strong as they were when dumbledore was here they wonthold much longer and we ve got to get organized let go hermione said she rushed out of the room and ron was with her every step of the way but it registered that he couldnthear harry heavy footsteps echoing behind him are you coming or what said ron turning back around harry has to stay here tonks said this is it ron thought this was the moment he d always known would come but in the past he d always been able to seek comfort by assuring himself that it wouldntcome to this for quite some time and now it was happening there was no later anymore there was only this only now what hermione cried no harry c mon said ron putting his hand on her shoulder he didntlook at harry because he didntthink he would be able to leave if he did we ve got to go no hermione said again you have to come with us you cant stay here dontdo this hermione harry said please the sound of his voice was enough to make ron bottom lip tremble just a tiny bit we re not going to let anything happen to him tonks promised but it wasnther promise to make and in all honesty there wasnta death eater in the bunch that would have any qualms about going through tonks to get to harry hermione was in his arms then and the pained look on harry face as he hugged her nearly made ron lose it this couldntbe happening now they needed more time even just a few more minutes ron just needed to get his head straight so he could figure out what he was supposed to do and then do it as best as he could they d spent the last year hell the last seven years talking about voldemort and the fight so why did ron feel like they d left so many things unsaid were they overreacting or was it even possible for ron to overreact when his best friend in the world a person who was merely just an extension of his own self had to go off and face impossible danger alone when hermione let go of harry ron nearly charged forward to embrace his friend he knew that he and hermione were probably doing nothing to calm harry just then but he also knew that he would never be able to forgive himself if something happened and he hadntat least begun to say goodbye first i ll see you when this is over harry said to them and ron had never heard him sound so determined and this er i mean if i wrong and well you know then you should know that i would be nowhere if it wasntfor you and even if i if we whatever i still wouldntwant to change anything looking at harry and hermione now remembering seven years of laughs and friendship of harsh words and hurt feelings and of fights both alongside and against each other ron could honestly say that he wouldnthave changed a thing either we ve got a team about to go out to hogsmeade to head them off but it might be too late lupin said he spoke loudly his voice booming and only a little shaky and yet ginny could hardly hear him over her own thoughts this was it she could feel it and looking around she knew that she wasntthe only one her mother hands shook as they reached out for her father neither twin was even contemplating making a joke and charlie looked well charlie looked ready for an all out fight to the finish bill held onto fleur just as ron held onto hermione her mother was gripping her father hand so tight that arthur was wincing fred had angelina and george was with alicia charlie sure seemed to have cassi but ginny was alone because harry was still at hogwarts he was still in the middle of all the danger it wasntfair that everyone but her got to be on the same level as the person they loved it wasntfair that harry role in this whole thing was the most important and it certainly wasntfair that no matter what ginny did harry was going to get himself killed or close to it because he was just too damn noble and heroic to stand by and let anyone fight this battle for him she tried to get harry to lower his wall but he clearly had too much to deal with and didnthave time to talk to her that was what she chose to believe at least she couldnthandle thinking about any of the other reasons as to why he wouldntbe able to communicate with her just then it had occurred to her some weeks ago that their connection could potentially be used for more than just sharing thoughts if their minds were open to one another and one of them was hurt would the other feel it ginny thought so harry hadntbeen so quick to agree but she was still nearly certain she d felt an awful jolt of pain when he d been injured getting that horcrux hadntshe but there d been no way to test it they certainly werentgoing to hex each other the only people who knew about their situation were ron and hermione and ginny knew that neither of them would ve been incredibly supportive of the idea either and what if one of them had died would the other one feel it or would their minds just close off to one another the way it had before she was going to have to be very careful about everything now if her theory was right her safety was far more important than it ever was in the past sharing something like pain would only benefit them if it was ginny sharing harry pain and not the other way around she had to make sure she didntdo anything stupid that would put her in a situation where she could potentially jeopardize harry health and abilities that was another factor too wasntit harry wandless magic was going to take up a ton of his energy every time he d ever performed any of it in the past he d always been left feeling drained if he could somehow use their connection to draw energy from her he could be that much more powerful wasntit at least worth a try she couldntdo this she couldntsit here and listen to everyone outline their plans while harry was out there without anyone to make sure he was safe they needed to get to wherever the fighting was so she could help him who cared if they all knew exactly what they were doing or not ginny rarely felt like she had any idea at all of what was happening and what was still going to happen and she knew that she wasntthe only one she looked around at everyone she hadntseen so many people looking so absolutely out of their element since since she was standing in a group of new students on her first day of hogwarts and though less extreme her first day at hogwarts had been remarkably similar to this moment she d been surrounded by so many of her brothers but she d been so horribly alone just the same and even though people had been in her exact position before and had been in worse positions before it was as though nobody had ever or would ever again know the terror she felt in her heart in the moments before the sorting hat sent her to gryffindor she felt that same fear now for as scary as that moment had been for an eleven year old girl with everything to prove to her brothers this moment was all that and more for the girl with everything to prove to both harry and herself ginny thoughts were interrupted when tonks began speaking when had she gotten there ginny studied her and surely shad never seen anyone look so distressed in her life there are more of them than we could ve imagined we need absolutely everyone in on this not just order members get in contact with anyone who has proven themselves trustworthy and is willing to help what going on she yelled but it was drowned out by the other frantic voices in the room as everyone scrambled off to recruit outside help finally hermione answered her they they ve taken hogwarts ginny fought for her breath we ve got to start owling people then she said the room was filled with people who towered over her and she could hardly find her way out of the crowd like who said ron coming up behind her we donthave any contacts luna and neville ginny said quickly colin and dennis would come if we asked them and dean will help too of course and maybe even lavender if you write her nicely ron hermione you can get krum and probably mclaggen if you try it wouldnthurt to write the patil twins either i bet demelza and the rest of the quidditch team would show up i ll ask michael corner too i think i know a few hufflepuffs who would at least consider and d you think cho would be willing to get her friends together and help she was not sure if any of these sentences were said aloud or not all she knew was that she needed to find a way to get in contact with as many people as she could and she had to figure out how to express that their help was desperately needed while downplaying the fact that most of them would be completely out of their element when faced with this much danger how re any of them going to help said ron dismissively they re not ready for this neither are we said hermione perhaps we should there a difference between us and them ron argued they ll be killed and said ginny and ron repeated what the hell d you mean maybe ron right said hermione casting a worried look at ginny there no screening process here cried ginny we re not looking for the next great warrior we re looking for anybody who can get between the death eaters and harry so even if i have to owl all of them myself i will as long as harry alive when this is over even if it means i responsible for killing off half of your year and mine i not going to feel bad about anything done here today ron and hermione exchanged glances and she could nearly read their thoughts as if they were her own has it really come to this and as ginny raced to the burrow and rounded up all the owls they had at their disposal she reassured herself that it had indeed come to this they re through someone yelled harry couldnteven begin to focus on who it was tonks went to go update everyone at headquarters leaving him in dumbledore office with the instructions to stay here and stay out of trouble looking through the window at the mass of black robes that were rushing toward the school harry doubted very much that he would be able to do either of the things tonks had told him to do when death eaters had attacked hogwarts last time harry hadntbeen there he and dumbledore had been off on a pointless horcrux mission this time around things were going to be different dumbledore would have to sit this out but harry certainly wasntgoing to he was going to defend his school the way he would defend well actually the only other thing harry had was headquarters but that held very little sentimental value to him and the burrow was like his home and he loved it but it wasnthis the weasleys owned it and they were just nice enough to let him act like he belonged there but hogwarts was his it belonged at least in a tiny way to everyone who went there the only difference was that most of the other students and teachers had other places to call home and harry did not it occurred to him that he may never have another place to defend the others would grow up and have houses of their own someday but harry would perhaps never get that opportunity if he died now he would never know the pride of having something that was entirely his hogwarts was as close as he would ever come and the idea of death eaters trying to take this from him made him angrier than he could ve expected he kept watching through the window for as long as he could bear he thought back to something mcgonagall had said to him when he was about to attempt the wandering spell to rescue ginny about how there were other more expendable people to do the dirty work instead harry had hated her in that moment but at the same time he had understood what she was trying to say the same was true for now there were two choices he could hide and stay safe until the time was right so he could finish voldemort for good or he could go out there and fight with everyone else and maybe get seriously injured or captured or a million other things all of which would ruin their chances at winning but at least he wouldntbe sitting on his hands he looked down at the grounds and saw a group of aurors trying to keep the death eaters from getting inside the school he spotted kingsley right away and also recognized several others whose names he d never gotten the chance to learn why did they have to put their lives on the line to keep him safe harry realized that he had obligations he had to do everything he could to kill voldemort that was his only job and everyone else jobs were centered on keeping him alive long enough to complete it but these people were his friends they were all skilled witches and wizards most importantly they were wonderful people he d gone on order missions with them and fought alongside them how could he just sit back and watch them fight a losing battle wasnthe also obligated to help them dumbledore wasntin his portrait he was probably at headquarters trying to organize everything half of the other portraits were missing and the ones who remained were demanding that harry tell them everything he knew the trouble was that harry didntknow a bloody thing he wished someone would come for him soon whether it be dumbledore or tonks or even a rude git like charlie he alternated between staying glued to the window and pacing the room in frustration he could almost hear his heart pounding his fingertips itched the way they did quite often as of late almost as if there was an enormous buildup of excess magic just waiting to be used he knew that his wandless magic was going to be an important part of his fight but he d never fully exerted himself either on missions or in training for fear that something would come up and he wouldntbe able to recover in time really he had no idea what he was capable of it was frightening to think that he could maybe do a million and one amazing things with this skill and that he didnteven know it and on the other hand it was frightening to think that he was relying quite a bit on his wandless magic and that it might not even come through for him in the way he d need it to what if he was just kidding himself could he really do this of course he couldn t he was going up against one of the most powerful wizards of all time how could he even think he could do this he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against the window his mind was a dangerous place either voldemort was invading it or he was letting his own paranoid thoughts get the best of him he took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down he could do this he would do this too much was riding on this for him to fail he wouldntlet himself fail harry harry turned and saw that dumbledore had returned to his portrait sir said harry were you at headquarters what going on dumbledore merely smiled actually harry i have just come from my other portrait there were a few issues that i needed to sort out there you have another portrait sir harry asked he remembered dumbledore mentioning something about this once but he hadntfound anything significant about it then and he certainly didntunderstand why dumbledore would go there now when this was going on at hogwarts why yes said dumbledore at spinner end tonks came back at that moment and relieved harry from his conversation with dumbledore come on she said we ve got more people coming to help but the death eaters are inside and we cantrisk you staying here any longer ginny ron spun around at the sound of someone calling his sister from the other room ginny jumped up from the kitchen table where she and hermione had been frantically writing letter after letter to friends asking for their help ron eyes nearly bulged out of his head when a frazzled looking neville longbottom entered the weasley kitchen neville ginny cried you came of course we did he said we said hermione ron eyes left neville and went to the second figure entering the kitchen hello said luna lovegood sounding surprised as though they d all just walked into her house and not the other way around an owl came with ginny letter so i floo d to luna and got her too before coming explained neville is anyone else here ron shook his head you re the first ones he said but what he meant was you re the only ones truthfully he would be shocked if anyone else showed up luna and neville had already proven several times that they were dedicated to helping in any way that they could and so although he was pleased that they d come he wasntoverly surprised but the others had long since given up on the da and surely they had better things to do today than get themselves killed in a battle hopefully we ll hear from some of the others soon hermione added sounding more hopeful than ron would ve expected he looked at her sideways did she really believe that anyone else would volunteer to help they were all gryffindors sure but that didntmean any of them were going to venture out of their safety zones to come fight to the death because they were asked by a couple of their schoolmates what did these letters even say sorry we haventbeen in touch in close to a year and even though we werenthorribly close back at school d you think you d be able to help me out by coming to risk your life in the final battle against voldemort this wasntlike asking to borrow a piece of parchment or to copy someone astronomy homework and ron hermione ginny and harry hadntbeen in touch with virtually anyone especially in the last few months if the situation was reversed and someone like the patil twins were writing to ron and asking for him to enter into this much danger for them would he go of course he d go but only because he d grown up with stupid noble harry and somewhere along the way a lot of the traits that often got harry into trouble had rubbed off on him that an interesting clock said luna airily looking around the kitchen and where harry ron closed his eyes he wished he knew the answer to luna question at the moment he didntknow anything he didntknow if harry was even still alive he forced himself not to think about it if only because ginny and hermione couldntknow how worried he was he had to be strong for them if he didntkeep things together who would but when he looked at the girls they both seemed far more composed than he felt they looked determined ready for war ron thought who would ve guessed that when it came down to it hermione and ginny would be the fierce warriors while ron was the one worrying about everything i ll be back said ron he went upstairs before anyone could say anything to stop him he sat down on his bed and looked around the bedroom he d shared with harry for so many summers now get it together he told himself he closed his eyes again and conjured up every positive image he could these were the things he was fighting for he wasntafraid for himself in the least he would do what he had to do and would not complain or think twice about it but what about hermione harry his family he told himself that when this day was over everything was going to be exactly the way he remembered it because he simply would not stand for anything less it was delusional surely he was setting himself up for a giant fall but convincing himself that it would be okay was the only way to get him through these next crucial hours and he needed to get through them feeling steadier than before he went back downstairs and re entered the kitchen dean was there and lavender padma and parvati were in quiet discussion in the corner colin creevey was sitting at the table helping ginny write more letters over the next several minutes the rest of the gryffindor quidditch team arrived the twins came back home with some of the people who were arriving at headquarters including viktor krum absentmindedly ron thought that this would be the only time that krum would ever be welcome in his home in no time at all the burrow was filled with friends and acquaintances of all sorts and there were still more arriving every second the plan had been to keep as many non order members away from headquarters as possible but ron knew that soon there would be too many people to fit in the burrow and they d have to move people were going out in shifts though ron had no idea where they were going or what they were going to do when they got there it was amazing how quickly everything came together it felt as though it took hours to get everyone settled but at the same time it was as though everyone was operating on a different level today everyone seemed to realize the severity of the situation and was for one day only willing to ignore egos and listen to those in charge if anyone got any lingering problems sort them out now said kingsley from here on out there no turning back with that he went back into the other room wait is this really y know it asked neville shifting uncomfortably his words tumbled out so quickly that ron could hardly catch what he said because i i didntsay goodbye to gran and if i going to die today i should probably leave her a note or something so she ll remember to feed trevor he looked at them expectantly and if ron hadntbeen so wrapped up in everything else going on he would ve realized that neville was looking to be reassured he was waiting for ron to call him crazy to tell him that surely they would all make it out alive and that nobody would have to leave any sort of goodbye notes to their loved ones instead ron said nothing not even after ginny looked up and said point blank there parchment on the table i think you should probably write that note if you promise not to give up on this story i promise to do the same the second part will be out eventually but i make no promises as to when review i d like to get this to 3000 before the end disclaimer i dontown harry potter i decided the only way this was going to get written would be if i skipped right into the fighting use your imagination to figure out how everyone got from the end of the last chapter to the beginning of this one writing fight scenes and the like has never been a particular strong point of mine and it kind of bums me out that the last official chapter of this is going to be purely fighting and thus not my best work but whatever i just glad i managed to finish it there still a short epilogue which i absolutely swear will be out before deathly hallows chapter fifty two the end hermione couldnteven move without the risk of stepping into the path of a hex intended for someone else this was more than insane so far every time she was in a situation involving death eaters or anything even remotely related to voldemort it had always been more intense than the last time but this far surpassed anything she d ever experienced before and she knew she hoped that she would never be in a situation like this ever again crucio she dove behind a statue for protection and winced when it shattered once hit with the curse as she ran her sleeve caught on another and ripped but then that statue was blown up as well and so she didntstop her first thought was how terrible it was that hogwarts was being destroyed her second thought was that she d just ripped a very nice article of clothing and her third thought was that neither of those things should matter to her at this moment this was the final battle she was supposed to be on her mark she was supposed to be thinking like a warrior but she wasn t why had she expected to walk into this fight ready to go with hardly any preparation she should ve trained more she should ve read up on more spells merlin what had she done since school let out last year she heard a yell that she could ve sworn belonged to ron time seemed to slow down as she rushed down the corridor to find him hermione look out someone called she stopped and turned just in time avada stupefy she cried only just in time she turned to lavender thanks lavender eyes were wide hermione followed her gaze and gulped at least a dozen death eaters had turned down their corridor and were headed toward them there was no way they could take on that many death eaters on their own come on hermione said grabbing lavender wrist and running the opposite direction she didntknow where she was going she didnteven know where she was she couldntget her mind to focus on anything other than where her friends were and whether or not everyone she loved was still all right lavender took over at some point and pretty soon hermione was being pulled into a dark corridor that she d never seen before she probably snogged a million different boys in this spot mused hermione but she remembered that lavender had just saved her life and so she felt guilty for her thoughts lavender sunk to the floor and clutched her ankle wincing in pain they re everywhere she said in barely a whisper there there are so many of them hermione took a few steadying breaths and gripped her wand and more and more are arriving she said quickly that why we ve got to get back out there to get rid of as many as we can before it starts getting out of control you dontconsider that to be out of control lavender squealed she covered her eyes with her hands arentyou scared of course hermione was scared she was scared that while she was here taking a nice break ron was out there taking on three death eaters at once she was scared that ginny was cornered and wandless or that harry wasntlooking out for himself because he was trying to do right by everyone else terrified hermione admitted though she didntfeel as though she feared the same things lavender did who wouldntbe lavender shifted and cried out oh i think i ve really hurt my ankle hermione knelt down beside her i know a couple healing spells can i try one try as many as you have to said lavender she sounded so worried and so grateful to have hermione help that hermione could almost forget every nasty thing they d ever said about each other hermione performed one spell and lavender said it felt as though it worked but she spoke through gritted teeth and hermione knew that she was just trying to be hopeful she went through three more spells before lavender sighed in relief and announced that the pain had really dissipated then thank you she said getting to her feet again she looked hermione in the eyes and it was clear that she knew it was time to leave the safety of their abandoned corridor and re join the fight now probably not the time she whispered but i i hardly remember any of my da training right now then keep your wand out and stick close said hermione as they began walking lavender let out a half cough half laugh to you she said though without any malice you had a pretty close call back there yourself you know i suppose i did said hermione thank you for that can i ask i mean were you running anywhere particular you looked kind of hermione shrugged and kept looking straight ahead i thought i maybe heard ron i wanted to make sure he was all right you nearly got yourself killed though perhaps it was just hermione imagination but lavender voice seemed to change she looked over her shoulder at the other girl yeah so she asked sincerely lavender blushed do you think parvati and padma are okay she asked changing the subject we tried to stick together but it was impossible so i was just wondering what you thought about their chances they should be okay for a while i suppose if they remember their da training said hermione she couldntpromise anything to lavender and she didnthave a right to pretend that anyone was guaranteed to live past tonight truth be told when it came to getting people to fight in the final battle the patil twins probably werentthe best candidates for the job you think so continued lavender she had moved up to walk beside hermione now and her voice was just loud enough to echo because i ve been staying with them for a little while and when your letter came padma wanted to come help but parvati wasntso sure i was kind of the tie breaker vote and so if anything happens to parvati it going to be my fault because i made her come you didnt make anyone do anything hermione reassured her though if she was honest she didntreally care very much about lavender guilty conscience parvati was perfectly capable of deciding on her own if she wanted to come or not padma her sister and i ve been her best friend since first year said lavender she shook her head her choice was to help us fight or sit back and cross her fingers that we didntdie if anyone knows what it like to be a package deal i would ve figured it d be you hermione cast a sideways glance at lavender she knew she should cover up the surprised expression on her face but she couldntmanage it they had shared a dormitory room for six years at hogwarts but this was the first moment in which hermione could actually see just how much they had in common after all if someone had asked a twelve year old molly prewett what she saw when she envisioned her future she would ve said that she was going to be a widely successful healer when she grew up she was going to treat very important and powerful people like the minister of magic because they would demand the very best care and she would deliver just that the last thing she d imagined at the tender age of twelve was that she would elope straight out of hogwarts and have her first of seven children immediately after and then spend the next thirty or so years of her life being a full time mother and housewife she had planned many things but she had not planned on arthur weasley and she had not spent a single night of her childhood lying in bed trying to think up good names for the seven children she was going to have someday she d wanted two at most not that she d really allowed it to factor into her plans most of the time when voldemort began his rise to power molly was one of the many students in her year who wanted to do something about it when arthur told her about a new organization called order of the phoenix molly had jumped at the chance to join she was suddenly very excited at the prospect of fighting in this war possibly even helping out as a healer and the time she spent fighting for the order was truly amazing but then bill had come along and she d taken a backseat role because she was a mother and who would take care of her baby if something happened to her one baby turned into three and then the twins came along and by then molly loved being a mother so much that it was only logical to have a few more molly weasley was not the witch she d intended to be but was that such a terrible thing sure her dedication to her family meant that over the years she hadntbeen able to help the order as much as she d liked but she certainly thought it was worth it and she d raised seven incredibly strong children each a warrior in his or her own right who were more than ready to join this fight reflecting on her old way of thinking it was almost as though molly was remembering the characteristics of a close childhood friend instead of herself she could not imagine not having a single one of her kids even harry and hermione she loved all nine of them more than life itself that was what made this day so frightening they d all been in dangerous situations before what else was to be expected with charlie working with those bloody dragons and the countless situations bill got himself into but nothing they d been through could even compare to today they were capable and strong but she was their mother and so she was allowed to be unimaginably worried for all of them especially ron harry and hermione they d grown up so fast and now faced so much responsibility they fully accepted those responsibilities and handled everything so gracefully how could she not be proud of them above all else when had they stopped being eleven there were times that she heard ron footsteps on the stairs and in the instant before he entered the kitchen she was half expecting to see the boy he d been seven years ago and harry she could not comprehend the danger he was in she didnteven believe that harry fully understood his role in this she scanned the area hoping to catch sight of any of her children she was especially desperate to know what was happening with harry she hadnteven gotten a moment with him before all of this began the way she had with the others where was he what if he was with voldemort right now and what if something happened to either of them and she never got to say a proper goodbye avada kedavra she heard the curse and couldnthelp but turn she had to make sure it wasntone of her children when she found the victim she gasped wasntthat oh it was the boy ginny had dated just before harry she paused and closed her eyes for a moment but then had to keep moving merlin help his poor mother harry waited until tonks turned her back for an instant and then he made a break for it someone had brought his invisibility cloak to hogwarts for him and so he kept it wrapped around himself as he ran through the corridors he had to find ginny so he could give it to her he considered lowering his wall as he was so used to doing by now but then he considered just how much trouble that could get her into if he was suddenly ambushed and attacked what if ginny theory was right and they could use their connection to spread the pain out between the two of them he couldntstand the thought of her feeling even an ounce of pain because of him he ended up outside though he d never understand how he made it through the entire castle without getting hit by a stray spell how long had this fight been going on for there were bodies everywhere how many of them were dead how many more would die before this was over he had to find ginny to make sure she wasntone of those unlucky people and he had to find voldemort how was he going to manage that once the final horcrux had been destroyed he d felt relieved because this fight was finally approaching its conclusion and he held all the cards but this was not how he d expected the final battle to go he hadntimagined that he d be wandering around firing spells out from under his invisibility cloak having no bloody idea where he should be it was becoming clear to him that voldemort was going to set a trap and the only way for harry to find his enemy would be to allow himself to fall into it but could he really do that his mind hit a standstill when he thought he saw a flash of red hair his eyes scanned the crowd hoping to see ginny but he couldntlocate the person he d spotted mere moments before and now his mind was really playing tricks on him because he could ve sworn he d just spotted snape out of the corner of his eye he did a double take forgetting that snape had been reported dead ages ago and it was therefore impossible for him to be running around the grounds but no that was snape it had to be whether it was the real snape or a polyjuiced version harry didntknow what he did know was that he couldnttake the chance he thought back to what ginny had told him about snape if what she said was true and of course it was because ginny wouldntmake something like that up then snape had been on the good side all this time and although harry wanted to believe that his former professor was nothing more than a backstabbing traitor who murdered dumbledore he had to admit to himself that it just didntadd up why would snape have saved his life in hogsmeade if he was unquestionably loyal to a wizard whose main goal in life was to kill harry potter it occurred to harry that each and every one of snape actions leading up to this point could have been a carefully constructed plan all design to lure harry into a trap at this very moment but was snape really that smart or that dedicated was anyone other than maybe hermione what about the daily prophet claim that snape had been killed months ago why would they publish that if it wasnttrue though it wasntas though the daily prophet was above printing false stories especially when harry was concerned but was snape really worth all that trouble unless someone had hooked the prophet up with a false story knowing that it would make the front page and that harry would see it but again wasntthat a lot of effort for a plan that might not have even worked the article had said that bellatrix lestrange was the one who killed snape if he remembered correctly though hadntthe article also said that snape was found tortured and killed so how would the reporter know who d done it if they d only been around for the aftermath unless the reporter was on the inside with death eaters but how likely was that why had he waited until now to analyze this the more harry thought about this the more convinced he was that the story had been completely concocted by a desperate reporter to sell more newspapers did it matter though if snape was alive and here right now harry had to go after him he had to do something the idea of making snape pay was so appealing but if ginny had been right all along then harry would be punishing snape for no reason at all but was there really no reason regardless of whether he was truly a dark wizard or not snape had still sold out his parents he had still killed dumbledore regardless of the hidden possibly even logical reason wasntit harry duty to avenge them harry whipped off his invisibility cloak and snape spotting him took off in the direction of the forbidden forest harry followed after him snape had gotten away last year but he wouldntget off as easy this time around he gritted his teeth and charged forward he was gaining on snape as the git entered the forbidden forest in his mind he took back every complaint he d ever made about all the laps tonks made him run every morning during training he felt a thrill of excitement finally after all this time he was going to catch snape and get answers to every bloody question he could think of asking he ran deeper and deeper into the forest trying not to take his focus off of the outline in front of him the trees rose up high above him blocking out the light from the sun each time he thought he d lost snape he would hear the telltale sound of a branch snapping underfoot coming from somewhere in front of him which would tell harry that he was still on track he ran passed all sorts of creatures but paid them no mind he was no longer a scared first year who jumped at every little howl or strange noise he was on a mission and nothing was going to get in his way today the combination of darkness animals and trees prohibited harry from running at top speed but he continued to hurry along until suddenly his wrists and ankles were clamped together and he was tumbling to the ground he managed to keep his wand clutched tightly in his right hand but the way his wrists were bound together with rope behind his back he didntthink he d be able to do very much anyway he rolled onto his back and looked around his eyes having long ago adjusted to the new darkness of the forest snape jumped out from behind the shadows looking as he had when it was announced that he d be teaching defense against the dark arts last year well well said snape once again i find myself standing in front of the great harry potter wondering just what exactly people find so spectacular about you you have potential i will give you that but you lack the self discipline that must accompany that potential now look at where you are he scoffed following me into the middle of the forbidden forest as if you were going to get the best of me you fell right into my trap ginny trusted you harry hissed she nearly had me believing that you were on our side i am not on any side spat snape in a hushed voice which made harry wonder if anyone else was around to listen to them i merely want this to reach a conclusion so i can get on with my life then why the bloody hell am i tied up snape merely smirked and crouched down beside harry he dug his wand into harry throat for emphasis it high time you earned all that fame and glory you ve so shamelessly basked in for your entire life potter harry spat in his face you good for nothing piece of and then harry heard it the voice that had haunted his dreams every night in the summer after fourth year harry potter like every other battle ginny had ever participated in time seemed to fly by she felt as though she d been fighting for several hours in reality she d only been at hogwarts for close to two she was beginning to realize that everything she d imagined when thinking about how this fight would go had been far too outrageous this battle was just that a battle it was on a much larger scale with much higher stakes than the department of mysteries or what happened the night dumbledore died but it was still essentially just a fight between death eaters and order members with dementors and other nasty creatures thrown into the mix there were more death eaters at hogwarts now than she d ever thought there were in the whole entire world but the order had scrounged up a good number of volunteers too and so they were fairly evenly matched there was so much destruction everywhere if this kept up for very much longer hogwarts would be unrecognizable in the end there had been destruction at other battles too but nothing like this she couldntimagine how things would look in the end if she was even still around to witness it and there was another thing that couldntbe compared to past experiences too bodies covered most of the ground sometimes causing ginny to trip over them whether they were dead or merely stunned she didntknow she didnt want to know though she didntbet death eaters were running around using a wide selection of weak curses she wasntin danger of being on the receiving end of a trip jinx or bat bogey hex these death eaters were clearly under instruction and from what ginny had seen so far they were hardly using anything but unforgivables the order had clearly picked up on this and began to do the same in return she wasntsure if this was their game plan going in or if it was decided along the way the idea that aurors and other ministry workers werenteven hesitating to use the killing curse was almost unimaginable this was a kill or be killed situation if there ever was one before but did that make it okay and was it just okay for them to do it or could ginny do the same if it came down to it should she do the same if it came down to it she was outside now though she couldntremember consciously trying to make it out there she d merely been making her way through the castle defending her friends and attacking her enemies but never daring to stay in the same spot for more than a few minutes if she could help it she navigated her way through the grounds and ducked behind a tree when she heard someone near her shout crucio she heard another spell and then there was an awful tearing sensation in the back of her left leg followed by a harsh scream that she didntrealize was her own she lost her footing and fell to the ground landing nearly on top of a giant unconscious man in death eater robes she rolled onto her back wand at the ready but it seemed that nobody was going to come after her she must ve been hit with a stray spell or perhaps her attacker assumed she d been successfully taken out with that curse either way she seemed to be safe for the moment trying not to panic about her injury she twisted her body and winced at the pain that flared up in her leg squinting against the rain she looked down and saw quite a bit of blood but growing up with six aggressive quidditch playing brothers meant that over the years she d learned to heal cuts and gashes of varying severity and so she was somewhat confident that she could handle this she looked around there were so many bodies everywhere someone was coughing and wheezing a few feet from her she glanced over and felt her heart drop charlie she cried gritting her teeth at the pain as she crawled her way over to him across the wet muddy ground g ginny he ground out he didntlook good at all in fact he looked like he was about to she inhaled sharply at the thought but she had to be wrong he had to be okay he was her brother and he wasntallowed to die what happened she ground out scanning his body for any indication as to where his injury was she could help him she would help him she just had to figure out where he d been hurt and then she could heal him in no time everything would be all right where are you hurt i can no too late i donttalk she said desperately it wasnt too late she couldntlisten to him if he was going to be negative and if she was going to save him she couldntwaste time arguing save your strength he shook his head his eyes met hers though it didntseem to ginny that they were focused in on hers the way they should be and she knew to keep quiet and listen to what would probably be her brother last words i love you i only ever wa wanted what was b best i know she whispered tears falling from her cheeks and onto his i know will you st stay with me he sounded so far away from her she watched as his eyes slowly drifted shut she was lying out in the open with curses and hexes of all kinds flying around staying would probably get her seriously injured possibly even killed but what could she do this was charlie she could never leave him especially now if she hadntstumbled upon him he d be spending these last few minutes alone that thought absolutely tore her to pieces she remembered how angry she d been with him lately how she d nearly stopped speaking to him on several occasions she could recall every cutting thing she d said to him i hate you for this was especially rough and couldntbelieve her own foolishness he had been irritating and overbearing and rude to harry but he had only been trying to ensure that she was happy and safe and looked after even though he d taken the entirely wrong approach her hand found his and she nodded though he couldntsee of course i ll stay i love you so much she closed her eyes and listened to his faint breathing when it stopped altogether she opened her eyes and looked at him charlie she whispered her free hand smoothing out the lines of his forehead she tried to separate the good parts of this moment from the bad ones so she could take them with her the feeling of her brother hand holding hers the way it had so many times before the way he smelled like the burrow at christmastime the redness of his hair and the length of it the patterns in which freckles dotted his pale skin the firm set of his jaw the burns on his arms and calluses on his hands a direct result of his dangerous job the barely there scar over his right eye one he d gotten before she was even born the tattoo on his shoulder that he got when he was seventeen the one their mum still didntknow about when she had committed to memory all that she could she let out a great sob then leaned down and kissed his forehead he was already so cold goodbye charlie she stayed with him for as long as she could allow herself after several long moments she started to get up and was almost surprised to feel pain in her leg she d completely forgotten about her own injury with a shaking hand she held out her wand and healed herself when she scrambled to her feet she spotted snape rushing away from the forbidden forest her eyes were blurry from the tears and the rain but she was positive it was him it couldntbe true snape was supposed to be dead hadntthe daily prophet said hey she called her throat felt dry and cracked she called again and took off toward him so focused on catching up to him that she didnteven think to keep an eye out for curses being thrown her way wait snape what do you want he growled when she caught up to him you you re alive she said breathlessly i thought you i mean the prophet said yes said snape icily i was rather surprised to read that headline myself h how can you be it seems the daily prophet will print just about anything regardless of the validity of the report just to sell more issues why do you think they re always going on about what a hero your little boyfriend is she frowned speaking of harry she panted where is he i dontknow said snape nor do i care ginny narrowed her eyes at him liar she said where is he snape said nothing but his eyes darted toward the forest is he he in there dontbe silly you she began but her voice died out she turned away from him and took a hesitant step toward where she was nearly positive harry was she would go to harry even if he was in a deathtrap like the forbidden forest but what if he wasntactually in there what if snape was lying to her though hard to believe she had absolutely no reason not to trust severus snape still this was the final battle there were different playing rules for today she could never be sure about snape and while the risks had been worth it in the past this was the final straw and she couldntafford to make a giant error in judgment now was not the time to do something incredibly foolish and rushing off into the forest surely was just that think about what you are about to do snape said slowly rationally she tried not to listen to him he sounded somewhat concerned for her but she knew that he was a master manipulator this could be a trap it could all be a trap she considered what would happen if harry was truly in there and she didntgo after him she didntthink she could live with herself after this if she knew she hadnttried her best to get to him i going she told snape you ll never find him said snape grimly you re wrong you ll die in there he said was he trying to keep her out of there so she couldnthelp harry or was he saying these things because he respected her and perhaps genuinely didntwant her to die she was insane for trusting him to do the right thing wasntshe i might just surprise you even if you do manage to survive long enough to find him you will only find his body you dontknow that she began to walk away potter finished he called after her if you go after him you ll end up meeting the same fate perhaps an even worse fate we ll see she said but she was far enough away that she doubted he heard her she cast a final glance over her shoulder at him and she didntknow it then but it would be the last time she ever saw him alive bye snape dad yelled ron mr weasley turned just in time a second later and ron couldntthink about it now stupefy rennervate cruc protego incarcerous reduc petrificus totalus the spells were everywhere he didnteven know who he was fighting most of the time for all he knew some of his curses were hitting members of his own side but he couldnteven find the time to care everything was so rushed he didnteven know if any of his spells were effective he was just throwing them out there and moving onto the next person he heard one witch yell out a spell just as clearly as he heard everyone else call out their own hexes but her voice was embedded in his brain by now and the sound cut through him like glass lestrange he turned and trained his wand on her she was smirking at him that bloody awful cow he wanted to wipe that look off her face he wanted to make her pay for everything she d done she was the one who took him away from his family she was the one responsible for sirius going through the veil she had caused unbelievable amounts of grief to everyone he loved so much the words were only half out of his mouth when lestrange crumbled to the ground screaming in absolute anguish he saw neville on the other side of her glaring down with the coldest eyes he d ever seen he stood there gaping for a moment this one is mine neville said ron couldntargue with that especially not when he looked up and spotted another familiar face someone else with whom he had unfinished business at a time like this it was hard to feel anything other than that of sheer panic mixed with the ultimate rush of adrenaline but an entirely different feeling swept over him when he set his sights on dolohov he remembered that night two years ago at the department of mysteries and though he hadntbeen present at the exact moment of the death eater hurting hermione he could still visualize hermione in that hospital bed weak and vulnerable he went after dolohov and he had the wanker on the ground in a matter of seconds and then he said those words the ones he d heard echoing in his head a million times but had never dared attempt to say until now as he stood there trying to deal with the aftermath of what had just occurred he was struck square in the chest the voice echoed in harry ears and the wizard behind the voice revealed himself the man who had once been tom riddle stepped toward harry the long fingers of his pale hand were wrapped protectively around his wand his face was twisted into a ferocious grin as he stared down at harry with his dark red eyes here we are again lord voldemort hissed their eyes locked and harry stayed there frozen in a sort of stupor three years ago i had you in a position rather similar to the one we are in now he continued each word sent a chill down harry spine you made out far better than i had anticipated i blame myself really you see harry it is very difficult to lose all of your power for fourteen years and retain even a small amount of dedicated followers i however somehow managed to recruit even more in my absence harry didntwant to hear any of this but the longer voldemort went on the more time harry had to come up with an escape plan it was hard to make his mind work when voldemort wand was pointing right at him he had trained so hard for this moment and he now realized that no amount of mental or physical training could have ever prepared him for this this showdown was far different than the others this was the end of everything in every other instance harry goal had been to escape before being killed and he d always succeeded though just barely but this time his only means of escaping was to kill voldemort before voldemort killed him but i would have been a fool not to realize that there were some doubters among my death eaters voldemort continued i could have very easily killed you while you were tied up like a dog but defeating you in a duel would have shown that i was still superior that the boy everyone claimed had vanquished me forever was as i said merely a boy harry tugged at the ropes that bound his arms he could hardly move his hands especially with his wand clutched tightly in his right one but what was he supposed to do just let go of his wand that would be suicide he d never be able to find it in that darkness and even if it wasntpitch black he couldntexactly ask voldemort for a time out so he could go pick it up i allowed my pride and the expectations of others to get in the way of my goal because of that you escaped he turned back to harry and he gestured to their surroundings as you can see harry there is no one else here with us today and so after i get rid of you i can tell the story any way i want to the world will only know that you begged me to put you out of your misery and that i mercifully granted your request i wonder what your beloved weasley family will do they ll never have to go through that said harry you re not going to get the best of me on the contrary said voldemort waving a hand out and gesturing to harry current state i believe i already have and for the first time in a long time harry felt the overwhelming panic of uncertainty he didntwant to die he couldn t he shouldnthave to he was only seventeen for merlin sake he d barely lived at all if he died now he would die having known great friends and true love but did that mean he d had enough did that mean he didntdeserve more he deserved so much more everyone did harry was fighting so everyone else could have the chance to live again but why couldnthe fight for himself too why had he been so hung up on saving the others that he had never allowed the hope of saving himself he wanted to live more than anything else in the world he wanted to live with ginny and hermione and the weasleys he wanted one more year at hogwarts and another christmas at the burrow he wanted another quidditch game another chocolate frog he had to focus he had to get his hands free but how his wand was at an impossible angle and he needed his wand to the thought hit him like a ton of bricks he didntneed his wand at all for anything he cleared his mind he blocked out everything voldemort was saying he bit his lip hard enough to draw blood and repeated the words of the spell over and over in his mind it didntwork not the first time or the second time or even the third he was beginning to worry that it was utterly hopeless when he felt the pressure against his wrists and ankles disappear he didntdare risk a glance down at his legs for fear that voldemort gaze would follow and it would be discovered that harry had freed himself but even without looking he knew that the ropes were gone regardless of how accomplished he felt by merely doing that correctly he realized that the hard part was far from over he needed to fight he needed to actually fight simply throwing his wand out yelling expelliarmus and hoping for the best wasntgoing to cut it this time voldemort pointed his wand at harry and it was as if everything in the world melted away leaving nothing but this moment and the few crucial ones that would follow harry hands sprung from behind his back just as voldemort began av harry yelled out the first spell he could think of arrows shot out from the tip of his wand and voldemort clearly not anticipating that harry would be able to defend himself did not have enough time to react one of the arrows managed to puncture voldemort arm but the wizard gave no indication of his injury interesting trick voldemort said easily fight all you would like harry i assure you this is the final hour and you cannot win harry held out his hand it was one hell of a lot harder doing this sort of spell with his eyes open but he didntdare shut them now the way he did during practice with ron the pressure built traveling down his arm and into the palm of his hand crucio voldemort yelled but a small silver orb shot out of harry left hand and headed straight for voldemort meeting the curse somewhere between the two wizards and causing it to dissolve into the air the orb continued on and caught voldemort in the stomach sending him backward into one of the many surrounding trees voldemort disappeared into the darkness and a sound behind harry caused him to spin around he came face to face with his opponent once again you have picked up yet another new trick i see said voldemort angrily impressive now allow me to show you a few of my own there were people everywhere so many bodies were strewn across the grounds and still hermione knew that there was no end in sight the dark mark loomed overhead and the combination of wind and rain whipping against her face took her breath away the dementors had arrived some time earlier and she was surprised at how few people could conjure a proper patronus charm she d managed to apply the skills she d learned in the da well enough to help more than a few people protect themselves from the dementors but the air felt charged with so much negative energy and she was finding it more and more difficult to come up with happy memories to use in defense against them looking around at all the damage hermione shook with the realization that this wasntgoing to end here it couldn t even if harry did kill voldemort tonight what about the death eaters who survived and fled surely they would want to avenge their lord they would want to take over and carry on with what voldemort had been trying to accomplish harry destiny was to defeat voldemort and lucky for the world harry was not the type of man who could ignore his destiny but what about the death eaters who would be responsible for rounding them up and making them pay for what they d done would it be the aurors or would harry take it upon himself again if he did surely ron would want to help and she wouldntbe able to sit back and let the two of them do it alone how long would it take before the world would be completely safe again how long would it be before grown witches and wizards could stop looking over their shoulders every time they left their houses her heart sped up at the idea that this final battle was not the end of terror at all but a whole new beginning and even once every last death eater had been dealt with that wouldntbe the end hermione knew in her heart that there would never be true peace there would always be dark witches and wizards out there who would try to inflict the same amount of terror voldemort had there would always be witches and wizards looking to top what voldemort had achieved whether it took ten twenty or even a hundred years hermione knew that someone would rise up and cause just as much if not more damage just as voldemort had topped grindewald someone else would come along and do the same again she couldntlive this way for the rest of her life she couldntwake up each morning for the next sixty years wondering if anyone she loved would die before she went to bed that night she was tired of harry having to go to sleep with his wand under his pillow she didntwant to use a special password to be allowed through the front door of the burrow but for now she pushed it out of her mind it was easy to do actually considering where she was and what was going on around her there were all sorts of noises around her hermione wasnteven able to register half of them by now she didntflinch when her opponents screamed in pain she didntjump every time there was an explosion in the distance the words avada kedavra didntsend chills up and down her spine but when she heard this sound she did turn away from her fight to look what she saw made her stop in her tracks the entire west end of hogwarts had just collapsed in on itself an enormous cloud of dust rose up around the wreckage and hermione felt tears sting her eyes how could this happen to a place as peaceful as hogwarts she had committed the ultimate no when it came to battle she took her head out of the game so to speak and allowed herself to get distracted and someone took advantage of the opportunity to attack she felt a sharp stabbing pain in her left side and gasped she staggered forward her feet sinking into the muddy ground with each step she tore her eyes away from what remained of her beautiful school and saw a tree a few feet away she knew that it would be wise to get to it so that she could brace herself against it but those few necessary steps seemed like a marathon just now she could feel her heart pounding in her chest and her vision started to blur leaving trails where death eaters and order members had stood moments before she looked around one last time it was as if the crowd parted solely because she had willed it to and far across the grounds of a place she had spent so many days appreciating and could no longer recognize she spotted someone who could only be ron she watched him fall a moment before her eyesight went black and she collapsed as well the pain was unbearable harry felt stretched to the absolute limit he d been under this sort of torture for what felt like years now he wanted to scream but couldntfind his voice he had to focus all of his energy on keeping his mind closed off from voldemort he remembered what snape told him during occlumency lessons in his fifth year that voldemort invaded the minds of his enemies filling them with awful thoughts and imagery and didntlet up until they were screaming and begging to be killed harry didntwant that for himself and he especially didntwant it for ginny you ve been practicing i see said voldemort harry could hardly hear him over the pounding in his head not long ago he d been holding his own against voldemort how could the tables have turned back so quickly what a pity that your attempts have all been in vain we ll see about that gasped harry getting to his feet he threw a spell at his opponent but voldemort dodged it and the tree trunk behind him received the blast instead it took several other trees down with it as it fell and the earth shook from the force of the landing the damage around them was unbelievable the massive trees that had once loomed overhead had all been overturned there was a fire to harry right that was growing larger and larger if this was what had happened to the forest which had always seemed so intimidating and indestructible he didnteven want to imagine what the rest of the grounds looked like i have been waiting nearly eighteen years for this until now you have somehow managed to thwart my attempts at every turn do you have any idea how frustrating that can become voldemort shook his head not this time kill me then said harry tauntingly what re you waiting for unless you dontthink you can do it do not challenge me admit it you cantget rid of me you try and you fail every time and yet at the same time harry it would seem that it has always been you who cannot get rid of me that about to change he vowed voldemort eyes locked with harry s he tried to look away but he couldn t his head was swimming memories harry didnteven know he had were being called to the forefront of his mind order meetings searching for horcruxes hogsmeade with ron and hermione time with ginny the first prophecy he couldntlet voldemort be privy to this information he couldntlet voldemort hurt his friends more than harry had already allowed them to be hurt he gritted his teeth and held out his hands and even though he had no idea what he was aiming to do something shifted his memories faded away and suddenly he was delving into voldemort mind he caught only a few quick glimpses before being shut out voldemort red eyes were wide with the knowledge of what harry had just managed to do harry marvelled in it as well hadntdumbledore himself proclaimed voldemort as being the best occlumens and legilmens around ah yes the prophecy voldemort said quickly i suppose it is quite ironic that i have spent the last seventeen years trying to obtain it and it is only in this final moment at which i hear it at last but it doesntmatter any longer this is the end of you the prophecy harry had forgotten all about it it occurred to him that voldemort had no idea what the second prophecy said the one about him and ginny he d run through it a million times since first hearing it and so far everything but the very end had come true but voldemort was done playing his wand was fixed on harry who didnteven have time to react avada kedavra his life didntflash before his eyes and his last thoughts werentof ginny or hermione or the weasleys he didntreally have any thought at all ginny didntknow where harry was she didntknow if he was with voldemort yet or if everything had already happened and she d missed it entirely she didntknow who was winning or if there could even be a clear winner in a situation like theirs all she knew was that harry needed her plain and simple and she was going to be there for him even if she had to wander around in the blackness of the forest with all of the scary nasty creatures that lived in it she wanted to use their connection to find him she wanted to lower her wall and get him to do the same so she could at the very least be reassured that he was still alive and well but she couldntrisk doing that and distracting him for all she knew he was battling voldemort right now the idea sent chills down her spine she was so caught up in her own worries that she didntrealize she was going in circles the fifth time she passed the weird shaped tree with all the moss and the sharp looking thingy she stopped and let out a frustrated cry what a way to go out she thought one day her children were going to ask her for all the gory details about the final battle and she was going to have to tell them that she didntknow because she d spent the entire time lost in the bloody woods something jumped out in front of her wrenching a startled yelp from her lips it was a centaur ginny realized a moment later she immediately hoped it to be firenze but then remembered that he d been cast out by the other centaurs for taking a teaching position at hogwarts in her fourth year this centaur took a step closer to her and she could just barely make out red hair and a red beard who who are you she asked carefully politely my name is ronan said the centaur looking at her skeptically his eyes were trained on her i hello she said nervously she knew hardly anything about centaurs and the only thing she was sure of was that they generally hated humans of any kind i ginny ginny weasley sorry for um intruding you are only one of many humans who has come into the forest uninvited this evening said ronan he cast a glance upward mars is very bright tonight i can only recall one other night during which it was this predominant in the sky is that so she said she had no bloody idea what he was talking about and although she wanted to be respectful and cautious she also really just wanted to leave ronan and get to harry listen i i looking for harry potter have you seen him my path did indeed cross with harry potter tonight although he was not aware of it explained ronan he folded his arms across himself and stared down at ginny in a very intimidating manner harry potter is here to finish important business you cannot disturb him now harry needs me she said earnestly which way did he go ronan stared contemplatively at her for a long moment a great task lies before harry potter tonight he said i know i need to go to him so i can help him she insisted please i can sense that your intentions are pure and good he said at last he extended his arm to the right and said this way good luck ginny weasley she took off in that direction hoping she was right to trust in ronan she knew that centaurs hated humans but surely he wouldntlie to her about something this important would he she wandered just long enough to truly believe she d been deceived before she heard a telltale blast coming from just up ahead she hurried to reach the spot she could hardly breathe she had a fierce stitch in her side and her legs felt as though they weighed twenty times as much as usual but she didntallow any of these factors to slow her down she had to get to harry she finally reached the scene and spotted him she knew that the wizard before her was harry solely because there was nobody else it could be but he didntlook like her harry at all in that moment in fact had he not been standing opposite lord voldemort she would ve wondering if harry wasntthe dark wizard in the fight his eyes were narrowed and his hand didntshake as he held his wand out keeping it trained on voldemort he looked worse for wear and positively murderous she had never felt so proud and yet so afraid of him at the same time she pictured harry the boy who held her hand and whispered loving things in her ear and she could not connect him to this warrior standing before her who looked as though he was capable of committing any number of terrible acts she hardly even noticed voldemort she could not take her eyes off of harry not until the words voldemort was saying made their way to her ears and by then it was too late avada kedavra harry harry name echoed in her ears and she didntrealize it was her who had screamed it she didntgive her actions any thought she merely knew that harry could not die and she was prepared to do anything she had to do to keep him alive if only long enough to end this fight once and for all there was so much green and then even more white and then there was nothing at all it all happened so unbelievably fast the light was blinding as it headed straight for him in the back of his mind he thought he heard someone call out his name the green was all consuming it was all he saw and all he knew ginny came out of nowhere she was throwing herself in front of him and then harry saw something truly miraculous the most magnificent creature he d ever seen was heading toward him not quite flying but certainly too graceful to be making any contact with the ground it was in front of harry and ginny at once at the last possible second and then this amazing thing of beauty was collapsing to the ground dead he looked to ginny who was staring at him with the most peculiar expression on her face her eyes met his but there was nothing behind them she wobbled and he reached out for her but she was only just out of his reach she fell in slow motion it seemed and harry was instantly transported back to fifth year when he watched sirius fall through the veil in just the same manner he caught her halfway through her fall and sunk to his knees with her was she breathing she had to be breathing but she looked like she might not be she looked almost but no he couldnteven think the word she couldntbe gone she hadntbeen hit with the killing curse had she he looked at the unicorn which had taken the blast and was now visibly dead but ginny looked to be in the same state he couldntunderstand it his mind could not comprehend it one hand went to her neck searching for a pulse he didntfind one but perhaps it was merely because he was shaking so fiercely now that he couldntkeep still long enough to detect it his other hand which had let go of his wand the instant he sensed something was wrong with ginny stroked her cheek g he started but his voice died out his eyes filled with tears and and this couldntbe real because she was ginny and she was so perfect and she could not be dead she couldntbe everybody else was fair game when it came to this war but his ginny was not allowed to die he had vowed to keep her safe and he had broken his promise to both her and himself it should have been harry not her she looked just as she had down in the chamber of secrets she had to wake up from this he couldntlive without her he didntwant to he didntdeserve her he had never deserved her but he needed her more than he had ever and would ever need anyone or anything else he needed to see her everyday he needed to talk to her and laugh with her she was his everything he would trade everything he had to have her back he would give his own life in a second this fight wasnthers this fight was his and only his how could he have let her get involved if he d loved her half as much as he said he did he would ve kept her safe he d broken up with her at the end of sixth year for a reason how could he have completely blocked out all sane thought telling him to push her away and gotten back together with her like he had he had made a fatal error in judgment and deserved every terrible thing that could happen to him for putting his own need to be with ginny before her safety but ginny wasntat fault she shouldnthave to die because he was absolutely weak and despicable and the worst excuse for a wizard to ever live voldemort wand may have cast the spell but harry had sealed her fate long ago how could he have been so blind he d prided himself on always being rational and realizing that there was a very good chance he would die but he d never truly entertained the idea that ginny would be the one to suffer the consequences of his actions in every scenario he d envisioned he had always been the one to die and she had been the one to live on without him but this this was unimaginable he got to his feet and looked at voldemort again it was as if every moment of fighting they d done before this hadnthappened his exhaustion was erased before his need to defeat voldemort had been great but that desire had been nothing compared to now voldemort had killed ginny and even if it had been the only act he d ever committed to hurt harry it was the only one that mattered he d wanted to avenge sirius and his parents but they were the last thing on his mind now ginny was all he cared about even if it killed him he was going to get voldemort for what he had done to her he didnthave his wand but he didntneed it he didnteven want to use his magic he was going to kill voldemort with his bare hands and nothing else would be acceptable harry stretched his hand out toward voldemort and allowed everything to flow out of him voldemort let out a strangled gasp and one hand clawed at his neck while the other sent a spell toward harry harry waved his free hand and deflected the spell without a second thought he lifted voldemort up in the air so that his feet were inches off the ground he wanted to choke the life right out of his opponent but that wouldntdo it would be too quick too clean no amount of torture would equate to what harry wanted to do or to what voldemort deserved he said the spell in his mind and voldemort was sent flying backward voldemort stopped himself from falling and began again av but harry wouldnthave it crucio he cried it was the most amazing thing voldemort was on all fours crying out in pain all because of harry he had never known such rage in all of his life the feeling inside of him was nearly unbearable and channeling it into this into breaking voldemort down into nothing more than a weak shell of a man begging for mercy was the only thing he could think to do hearing voldemort screams would be satisfying if harry was capable of feeling that emotion but ginny was gone now and all he could feel was rage and hate at both voldemort and himself he had no reason to live now he would prefer to die in fact if it meant being with ginny but he was going to take voldemort with him no matter what the cost to himself or others he didntcare about any of it now just this he lifted the spell for only a moment then did it again and again and again it was different this time usually when he used wandless magic he could feel the energy draining out of him a little bit at a time until he was unable to muster up the strength for any more of that sort of magic but now he could only feel the power building and building as if he had tapped into an endless supply of it he could do anything in this moment he would do whatever it took he would do it for ginny you re just tom riddle harry hissed your father was nothing but a filthy muggle and you re no better than any of the other half bloods you ve been trying to wipe out for ages but this is the end i ve got your stupid horcruxes did you know that i ve got all of them every last one and now it looks as if i ve got you too you re finished tom he grunted in the effort to keep the spell going voldemort probably couldnthear him but harry didntcare he couldntstop the words from coming you think death is the worst thing out there i ll have you begging for it before i through with you this moment was both everything and nothing like ron had imagined all those nights he d spent lying in bed thinking about it blood did not ooze from his enemies and soak the ground or perhaps it did but there were so many bodies everywhere both injured and dead that ron couldnteven see the ground he put his hand to his chest and found it covered in blood when he brought it to his face his breathing sped up though because he was seriously injured or due to pure nerves he didntknow he looked up at the sky and was pretty sure he was near the quidditch pitch all he could see from his position was the dark mark that hovered above hogwarts and it hurt to move so he didnttry to look around for confirmation but if this was all really happening and he was maybe even going to die now he wanted to believe that he was going to do it on the quidditch pitch it had been raining for some time now harsh and stinging soaking the living and the fallen alike it was just what was needed to wash away everything that had become of their beloved school was this really happening here it didntseem possible that this was what had become of ron second home up until last year he d firmly believed that this school would never have trouble keeping the bad guys on the other side of the gates and now death eaters were on the grounds inside the school for the second time there were times during the last six years that he d felt safer here than he had in his own home but because of voldemort not even hogwarts was safe anymore this school had once been a sanctuary for hundreds of students would it ever be that way again when this was all over assuming of course that their side won would hogwarts be able to re open its doors and in twenty years would students be able to play on the quidditch pitch or eat in the great hall without thinking about how many people had died in those very spots during the infamous final battle ron thought of this school and all that it meant to him this was where he d met both harry and hermione everyone in his family had come here and they d all been proud members of gryffindor they d all been quidditch players or prefects or both it didntseem fair that ginny could possibly be the last weasley to attend hogwarts that percy would be the last one to actually graduate if hogwarts couldntre open and if all the future generations of children couldntcome and experience every last wonderful thing that ron got to experience during his six years here where was the justice in that he allowed his thoughts to switch to hermione he wished he knew where she was he wished she was at his side it was so hard to be angry or even afraid with someone like her at his side his eyes slowly drifted shut and he could see her as clear as day with her hand stretched out for him to take her voice was in his ear and surely nothing had ever sounded better if this was dying he didntthink it was so bad after all voldemort was good even after everything he was so good too good the cruciatus curse wasntenough for him and neither were any of the other curses harry had thrown around voldemort had come back from everything he was bleeding and wheezing and struggling to stand but he was still ready to fight to the end harry knew he had to use the killing curse and he had no qualms about it he had been prepared to do it since the end of fifth year hell he had been prepared his whole life but he didntwant to end this so soon he wanted to get the best of voldemort and he wanted to hit him with round after round of torture until he absolutely couldntwait any longer there was no concern that he would miss his opportunity if he didntact now he would never be in the weaker position again he felt powerful he felt utterly unstoppable as if he d had the ability to move and fight like this all along but had never given himself up to it until now had he been fooling himself all this time when he d used expelliarmus as protection in fourth year could he have been doing these sorts of things instead his head exploded in pain this was it voldemort last ditch attempt to gain back his control but harry had dealt with this pain before and if he had been able to come through it then he was sure as all bloody hell going to stick it out now suddenly something in his head came unscrewed and voldemort was in there with him no matter how many times harry experienced this he would never be able to get used to it or combat it how could he get rid of voldemort by filling his mind with loving thoughts when all he could think of was how angry and full of hatred he was this was excruciating he couldntlast he dropped onto all fours and by some miracle his hand brushed against his discarded wand he held it out almost blinded by the pain and gasped avada kedavra the flash of green was brighter than it had ever been before and as soon as it collided with voldemort the painful presence in his mind was gone voldemort dropped harry head was swimming he caught a glimpse of ginny on the ground beside him and his heart broke again he put his hands over her and a white burst of light passed between them but even in his hazy state he knew that it probably would not be enough it had been too long his entire body ached and he knew he should try to get himself and ginny out of the forest and to safety but he could not get himself to move the damage had already been done and so a moment after harry potter ended the final battle by successfully defeating lord voldemort everything went black for him as well there still an epilogue if you liked the way this ended and want to believe that everyone dies i suggest you dontread the epilogue when it comes out because believe it or not some of our favourites do make full recoveries this took a million years to come out and i apologize review disclaimer i dontown harry potter first chapter july 19 2005 final chapter july 19 2007 that kind of crazy if you really think about it chapter fifty three the price of freedom what felt like a lifetime later harry opened his eyes the white light blinded him but it was so warm and so consuming that he fought to stay there fought to keep his eyes on it where the hell was he his life came back to him in mental snapshots things and people he used to love but now just wanted to forget needed to forget he didntknow how long he d been asleep but even if it had been years now and it certainly felt like it was a possibility the final battle was fresh in his mind it had been preserved there and in this moment it was the only thing he knew he changed his mind and closed his eyes again he didntwant the light he wanted to drown in the darkness where there was none of these awful feelings and memories and regrets did you see that a voice said it sounded hazy and so far away see what another asked he just he opened his eyes the first one said there was a desperate quality to the voice that harry thought he might ve been able to recognize if he only cared more i didntsee anything well you must ve not been looking just wait he ll do it again but harry couldntdo it again his head burned and his body ached and his mouth was too dry opening his eyes would take more effort than he was willing to give he just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up i i dontsee anything but i saw him do it you didn t you couldn t he dont say that he gone he isntgone the healer said i know what the healer said it been too long the second voice said there was so much pain there so much harry could feel the guilt rising from somewhere deep inside of him nobody could ve no maybe nobody else is the world could ve but he could ve suddenly there was a hand clenching harry s warm and large but shaking i know you re in there i just know it c mon harry the first voice pleaded but it wasntenough for harry he felt himself getting lighter again his muscles were loosening and the light wasntburning through his eyelids the way it was a moment ago it felt like a warm blanket had settled over him there was something more than this he was sure of it he was going someplace else someplace far better ginny was probably there waiting for him and he wanted to go there so badly to be with her but that foreign hand was an anchor keeping him from going any further away he had one foot in the door but that grip wasntloosening at all nails dug sharply into his wrist and he flinched there did you see stop doing that he bleeding let go of him i can t the voice broke and the hand squeezed his even tighter i i cantlet go i think we should go home what no he still in there i know i know but he the voice died away he doesntwant to come back to us but i need him to it isntup to us if it was this isnt fair ron what part of this wasntfair harry had done his job he d done everything anyone had ever asked him to do and this was his reward he could finally let go and not have to care about the rest of the world he d already saved it once that was as much as he was willing to do everyone he loved was fine now they were all safe and sound harry had given them their lives back voldemort was gone what else could they possible have to worry about we didnteven get to say goodbye hermione we didntget anything and ginny what about her he didntwant to hear this ron and hermione he couldntstand the despair in their voices didntthey understand that they had each other what more could they possible need how could they take that for granted after seeing what had happened to him and ginny and how could they be so selfish as to try to keep harry in a place where he could never be with ginny again ron didnttake his stupid hand off of harry a moment ago he d been so close to going somewhere else but now it was as if the door had slammed shut and he was trapped on this side of it forever he hated his best friends for doing this for not being able to give up on him for always bloody being there always right up to the end and then even afterward merlin he loved them he wondered if they understood how much he loved them too much to lie there and pretend he didnthear them he wanted to just fall back asleep and never wake up but he wasntthat kind of person he wished with all of his heart that he was though and he hoped that one day soon he could become that kind of person harry opened his eyes again and when he finally focused them he saw red hair and wide eyes and a mouth hanging nearly to the floor hermione look ron choked out hermione was turned away she didntlook hermione he said again what she demanded she turned around and she was the same as harry remembered big brown hair and serious eyes she had tears running down her cheeks oh bloody hell said ron harry whispered hermione she brought a trembling hand up to cover her mouth you re he tried to speak he tried to tell them that he loved them and that he couldntthink of two other people he would ve rather gone through every ridiculous obstacle with he tried to tell them that he was sorry but he couldntstay that he couldntfind a reason to live in a world without ginny but he couldn t his throat was far too dry he couldntmake any sort of noise at all i ve got to go get her hermione said harry tried to protest he didntwant to see audrey or whatever healer was assigned to his case the less people who knew about this the better just once he didntwant to be the center of everyone attention he just wanted to say what he needed to say to them and then let go but hermione was already gone before he could even react he tried to sit up it hurt like hell he wouldnthave been able to manage it if ron hadntstepped in and done most of the work for him you re i mean he stammered he looked at harry as if they hadntbeen best friends since they were eleven as if he didntknow what to say or even how to act do you know what the date is harry just blinked bloody hell of course you wouldn t it it fucking july said ron five months you ve been er you were and the healers said you were just going to stay like that that we should just give up and go home good riddance you know but we didn t we i mean we couldnt harry could remember seeing ron this choked up only once before he was glad for his inability to speak he wouldntknow what to say anyway telling ron that this was a fluke and that he really just wanted to go back to whatever state he d been in seemed inappropriate especially now that he knew that ron and hermione had been visiting him for the last five months and that they d never given up hope despite everything ginny she would ve loved to be here when you woke up harry set his eyes on the blanket he knew that he could never put into words to ron how sorry he was about ginny he knew that ron was too good to say what his entire family probably thought that if it hadntbeen for harry ginny would still be alive and with them if harry did for some strange reason decide to keep fighting and go home to the burrow he would just be a reminder of everything they d all lost every time mrs weasley looked at harry she would see the reason her only daughter wasntgoing to be home for dinner that night mr weasley would see the reason he d never get to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day ron brothers would hate him forever he forced himself to look ron in the eye again he at least owed him that he wished he could somehow convey everything to his friend he needed to tell ron how sorry he was he needed ron to know that he was the best friend anyone could ever ask for and that harry had never done anything to deserve anyone like him harry would never be able to forgive himself for all the anguish he d caused the people who had so loyally stayed by his side through the very worst of times he needed to apologize for dragging ron and hermione into this and for letting them down in so many ways so so so many ways he had to tell ron that ginny was the most amazing person he d ever known and the fact that someone as awful as him was alive while someone as wonderful as her had died was possibly the greatest injustice ever he had to apologize for failing everyone for not doing more for not keeping everyone safe and handling the situation the way he should ve he wanted ron to know that nobody would ever love anyone the way he d loved ginny and that he couldntpossibly be expected to live in a world without her ron had to understand the reasons why he had given up and why he now wanted nothing more than to be with ginny on the other side even if harry could ve spoken he wouldnthave been able to get a word in ron was chatting away rambling about a million different things at once he really was a terrific actor that grin on his face looked so real but how could it be real after everything harry had done to him after everything harry had taken from him and hey check this out said ron he pulled his shirt up and harry eyes widened as he caught sight of a long scar stretched across the pale freckled skin of ron chest pretty wicked yeah he grinned proudly i spent two weeks in here after the battle well not right here because this is a ward for er more long term patients harry meant to nod or smile or give any sort of reaction at all but all he could do was imagine the million different ways ron could ve gotten that sort of injury no matter how it happened harry was to blame i dontknow what taking hermione so long ron continued ginny was only downstairs getting food harry wondered if ron realized that he d said ginny name instead of the name he d meant to say or perhaps he d done it purposely to see harry reaction but his thoughts ended when ron handed him a glass of water he gulped it down wincing at the pain in his throat ron stood up and poked his head out into the hallway ah he declared here they come it really the first thing harry noticed was ron being knocked out of the way as a body rushed into the room and the second thing he noticed was who it was he stared at ginny weasley and tried to remember how to breathe harry said nothing he didntsmile or reach out for her or anything he didnteven blink hermione couldntunderstand it if anyone was going to get a reaction out of harry wouldntit be ginny she and ron had figured as much but there ginny was standing in front of him and he was acting as if he had no idea who she was harry said ron that isntginny harry said his voice was faint and hoarse hermione strained to hear him he sounded hesitant maybe even a little angry but it was so wonderful to hear his voice after going the last five months believing she never would get the chance again what of course it is ron insisted ginny took a step toward harry and he was visibly uncomfortable with the idea of her being close to him it cantbe said harry quietly he looked down at his hands ginny died i harry ginny said softly hermione couldntsee her face but ginny sounded as though she was close to tears i right here i fine i promise but harry shook his head i saw her die he choked out it was she she died an inch in front of my face ron hermione shook her head but harry voldemort threw the killing curse at me and she jumped in front he continued ignoring hermione i there was nothing i could do he closed his eyes briefly so donttell me it didnthappen because i was there and you weren t hermione couldntstand seeing him like this did harry think this was all a big practical joke what in the world had happened in that forest anyway she d only heard ginny account and ginny had only been present for a few moments only harry and voldemort would ever know what transpired that night and voldemort was dead it would be up to harry to tell them the whole gruesome story something told hermione that nobody not even ginny would ever get the details from harry you re right said ginny that did happen only not exactly the way you think it did what are you talking about harry said harshly not bothering to look up at her it was the unicorn hermione explained you know about unicorns dontyou how pure they are harry shrugged firenze once told me that anyone who drinks the blood of a slain unicorn is cursed to live a half life exactly said hermione but there are other things about unicorns too killing a unicorn is one of the most awful acts that a witch or wizard can commit and there are certain magical properties that she paused how could she explain this she wasnteven sure herself of what had happened because ginny was the closest thing to it when it was hit with the killing curse ron jumped in a bit of the spell sort of transferred over to her she didntdie but she was pretty bloody close we still arentsure exactly how it all happened people are looking into it but you know the ministry even if they do find an answer i doubt we ll ever get to know about it maybe they d already known and just wouldnttell us then how is she alive now harry asked but his voice was softer than before he was looking anywhere but at ginny his eyes met hermione for a split second and hermione recognized something in them that she hadntnoticed before guilt that was because of you ginny told him i woke up nearly two days after the battle ended only i didntknow then how much time had passed i didntknow what to do you were still unconscious i considered leaving to get help for you but i didntthink i d be able to find you again in that bloody maze of a forest i thought the battle was still going on and i was in no condition to fight i felt so drained that i could hardly move ronan one of the centaurs told me that he d seen all of it right after you killed voldemort you transferred the very last of your energy into me that why you ve been here for so long without you i i would ve died no question about it he carried your body out of the forest with me by then everyone had nearly given up hope that either of us had survived harry looked as though he was trying to accept all of what she told him but it was clear that he was still having difficulty ginny moved even closer but still seemed apprehensive about trying to touch him i donthave all the answers it been months since all of this took place and i still as confused as you are about most of what happened in there harry glanced up at ginny for the first time since she came into the room so you didntdie and you re okay because of me ginny nodded entirely because of you and it over he whispered his hand was tangled in her hair now ginny leaned into his touch and nodded i mean it you said i killed voldemort and really it over just like that just like that said ron only harry wasntpaying ron the slightest bit of attention hermione wasnteven sure that harry realized she and ron were still in the room his eyes searched ginny face for the truth and ginny gave exactly what he wanted it finally over she choked out harry sat there motionless for a long moment hermione tried to imagine what could be going through his head but eventually came to accept that this was something perhaps one of the only things that she would truly never know she was quite fine with that truth be told if she got even a glimpse of what it felt like to be him she would probably break down she wasntas strong as harry in the slightest nobody was the relief and pride he was probably feeling was unimaginable to hermione but the grief and the burden and the anguish he had experienced for the last seventeen years could probably never be erased even by this moment of unbelievable achievement harry reached out for ginny and hermione motioned to ron for the two of them to leave the room she and ron slipped out quietly and she waited until she was in the hallway before she allowed her tears to fall i thought we d lost him a long time ago she admitted i i started to actually wonder if maybe the healers were right and he was gone we all did at one point or another he agreed he put his arms around her and she cried tears of joy and relief into his shoulder perhaps he cried as well but she would never be sure and certainly she would never ask she and ron had spent the last five months offering each other support in every way they knew how their side had won but there had been so much death and destruction hogwarts had been restored to its original beauty but hermione wasntsure that she could ever return anyway after all of the terrible things that had happened on those grounds going back for seventh year was unimaginable the thought of having to sleep alone in her dormitory was too difficult to bear perhaps the grass by their favourite tree would be just as green and lush as always but hermione would never again be able to look at that spot without seeing remus lupin flat on his back and getting a dementor kiss hermione would never be able to express the relief she felt that harry was awake and hopefully on his way to making a full recovery but her heart was heavy with the knowledge that harry knew nothing of what had happened to any of the others during the battle he only knew that ginny and his best friends were alive and that the good side had won out against voldemort and the death eaters he had no idea what was in store for him she and ron went to get benson one of the healers in charge of looking after harry when did he wake up asked benson he sounded half amazed and half as though he d been expecting the great harry potter to pull through all along only a few minutes ago said hermione how did he seem well he remembered the fight hermione reported there didntseem to be any damage i ll need to do an exam to make sure said benson and he ll have to stay here quite a while more just to be safe but i fairly certain that he ll make a full recovery if he as alert and in tune as you say he is i wouldntexpect anything less from mr potter neither would we ron said the pride in his voice was obvious benson expression turned serious is he asking questions yet not yet said ron his voice changed but we were only in there for a minute he with ginny now she wonttell him a thing until he ready to hear it though added hermione benson nodded i understand that this will be incredibly difficult but you have to tell him he said i think it would be best to do it as soon as possible hermione felt her heart drop into her stomach she thought they d at least get a few happy days with harry before he had to learn the truth not now she said there was finality in her voice that she hoped benson would not fight he going to ask you cantavoid it benson said wisely he ll only be angrier the longer you wait we know ron told him of course they knew hermione and ron had been waiting for harry to wake up for months now but in the back of their minds they had been dreading this day as well but we cantdo it not just yet he been through so much and doesnthe deserve the truth he deserves to be happy hermione countered she peered through the glass window and into harry room look at him in there he got nothing weighing him down anymore you dontknow the half of what his life has been like explained ron we ve known harry for seven years and we ve never seen him without something major on his plate doesntthat tell you anything he never had this sort of freedom before just let him have this moment please all right said benson but if mr potter is anything like you say he is he going to start asking questions very soon and you will need to give him the answers ginny wasntat all surprised when rufus scrimgeour stopped by later to visit harry but although she wasntsurprised that didntmean she wasntoutrageously offended by the minister nerve say the word and i ll give him a bat bogey hex he wontsoon forget ginny said under her breath harry had merely laughed dontworry about it he said stick around if you want though this might be interesting ginny sat down in a chair beside harry bed and waited for everything to start oh hello scrimgeour said to her when he came in would you mind terribly dear if i had a moment alone with mr potter the only person who isntwelcome in this room is you said harry so say what you have to say and then leave ginny marvelled at this sudden change in harry he had never exactly been the most respectful to any authority figures he disliked snape had been a prime example of this but until now harry would have never dared be so rude to the minister of magic it was strange and thrilling and rather sexy even i see your old pal dumbledore taught you a thing or two about arrogance scrimgeour growled ginny glanced at harry expecting him to snap at the mention of dumbledore she was shocked when he merely laughed and said no sir i learned that from you now get on with it i d like to hold a press conference in your honour once you re out of st mungo and fully recovered of course you know give you a medal that says order of merlin first class and the like that sounds dreadful said harry why would i want to participate in such a thing you think the world hasntbeen sitting back these last few months waiting for you to wake up asked scrimgeour the minute anyone gets word that you re awake and it ll be soon no doubt this hospital will be swarmed with reporters and admirers of all kinds and i can promise you that i dontwant that said harry but how will holding a press conference help this war is over potter said the minister the adoration you ll receive in the upcoming weeks will be huge but it will end the novelty always wears off give it a few months and you ll be able to relax in your kitchen without reporters busting in through the fireplace a few years and nobody will even remember your name ginny rolled her eyes she seriously doubted that anything scrimgeour had just said would come true but it was what harry wanted after all and so she hoped that just maybe this idiot of a minister would end up being right again i ask you how a press conference will help me slip into anonymity harry said sounding bored give em what they want straight away let em hear the story straight from your mouth and they ll have no use for you anymore they ll only want you more if you re quiet about it come to the conference get your medal give a statement acknowledge the ministry for our help in the war and we ll all shake hands and part as friends harry sat up a little straighter acknowledge the ministry he repeated the ministry denied voldemort return until not even two years ago look potter began scrimgeour dontbe difficult i ll make sure your er cooperation isntforgotten if you understand me i understand you all right said harry but i not going to get up in front of everyone and lie through my teeth about what a wonderful job you re doing as minister what will it take to make you reconsider ginny gaped at scrimgeour harry merely shook his head there nothing you can give me that could change my mind i ve already got everything i ll ever need and then some you ve wanted to be an auror for quite some time yeah the minister pressed i can make that happen for you harry cleared his throat perhaps i disillusioned but i fairly certain that i wonthave any trouble getting into the auror program he said but scrimgeour smile did not waver yes yes i suppose you re correct so tell me what you re after and i ll make it happen as long as i minister of magic you ll stay a very happy man lay it on me your wish is my command you ask and i will deliver harry winked at ginny well minister i dontsuppose you ve released stan shunpike yet have you scrimgeour finally got the message that harry wouldntcooperate and left though not without a good fight harry hadntminded that the minister came to visit him in fact a large part of him had been expecting it since he awoke it had been rather entertaining to say the least but he was glad that the meeting it was over with at least for now harry had been alone with ginny for what must ve been several hours not that he was counting it occurred to him that he would never have to keep track of time again they had all the time in the world now to do whatever they wanted they were free and he d always thought that this sort of freedom would come at an awfully high price but if ginny hermione and ron were with him what the hell sort of downside could there possibly be there something you should see ginny told him her voice was hard to get a read on okay he said he tried to feel nervous or anxious but all he could feel was happy something told him that all he would ever be able to feel from this point on was happy ginny picked up a small hand mirror and held it in front of his face his hair had covered his forehead for so long that harry did not immediately realize the difference it was not until ginny put a hesitant hand to his forehead and brushed the hair away that he even noticed the absence of his scar he stared at himself for a moment his features were the same as always his hair just as messy his eyes just as green his nose just as straight but without his scar it was as if he was looking at an entirely different person he struggled to recognize himself somewhere in that person reflected back at him ginny took the mirror away and looked at him again he caught his reflection in her eyes and suddenly he could see himself the way she always had he was just harry and for the first time he felt that he could really begin to know who harry was are you okay she asked your scar i she paused looking at him with concerned eyes i not sure what this means to you it was just a mark gin he said already believing it himself growing up it was my favourite feature but if you think about what it meant what it symbolized i not that person anymore and i never going to miss it ginny had tears in her eyes she put her hand on his cheek and leaned into him it okay to cry you know she said i can t he said i mean i dontthink i even know how to cry anymore but here hoping i never have another chance to find out yeah ginny looked at him with pity and worry in her eyes and he felt an unbelievable rage flare up inside of him she was looking at his as if he was weak or pathetic or stupid nobody got to look at him like that he was harry fucking potter he d saved the wizarding world he d be damned if he let some snot nosed little brat feel sorry for him nasty filthy blood traitor as if she had any idea how to emphasize with him he was a million levels above her he was a million levels above them all surely she realized that he opened his mouth to tell her to take her pity and shove it straight up her and then it was gone even though it was so far from the truth he convinced himself that he had no idea what could ve evoked such awful thoughts and feelings inside of him his hand shook and he hid it under the blanket so ginny wouldntnotice he no longer had the sudden irrepressible urge to grab her and scream at her and hurt her but his blood was still boiling and there was still that flicker of something lurking around in the very deepest part of him he waited a moment for it to pass and it did somewhat but not enough that he was confident it could never come back it was to be forever inside of him festering and perhaps even growing taking hold of him until maybe one day when but it would not happen that way harry had always believed that people were either innately good or innately bad and that it was virtually impossible for a person to change such disposition but what if that wasntthe case maybe everybody magical or not had good and evil waging a constant war inside of them maybe the only thing that would keep harry from being like voldemort was the fact that tom riddle had not had it in him to fight the evil while harry did not have it in him to give up fighting perhaps if nothing else it was harry desire to be good or at the very least his desire to not be evil which separated him from voldemort someone had once told him that he and he alone had the ability and the authority to choose his destiny he had always felt that his destiny was to defeat voldemort but he now understood that this was not at all the case the world had opened up to him in ways he could not have previously imagined and he refused to slam the door shut on all of those wonderful possibilities because of something inside of himself that he could control ginny held his gaze for a moment and a flicker of concern passed over her face before she cleared her throat and looked away from him as they had previously discovered their mental and emotional connection to one another was gone but harry no longer needed such a thing to connect with ginny and he believed she felt the same he put his hand on her cheek and said i okay it was perhaps the first time he d ever said those words and meant them her eyes met his again and he knew that she understood ron and hermione came in benson said he ll be bringing you another potion in about an hour said hermione harry shrugged he used to hate taking potions at hogwarts mostly because of the horrible taste but he would take anything no matter how vile it tasted if it allowed him to leave this bed and go home soon he wanted to see all of his loved ones he wanted to have a giant party outside right in the open because they never again had to worry about being attacked by another death eater operating under voldemort orders something occurred to harry he d been awake all day and nobody other than ginny ron and hermione had seen him he didntexpect everyone to drop everything to come visit him and truthfully he was grateful for the chance to be alone with just ginny and his friends for a little while but at the same time he thought he really could use a big hug from mrs weasley right about now why hasntanyone else stopped in said harry i mean i know i not supposed to have a lot of visitors until i better but i d like to see them all ron and hermione exchanged looks ginny pursed her lips let get you healthy enough to get out of here and then we ll go from there okay suggested ginny something didntfeel right he was so used to always expecting the worst that he couldnteven tell if he was just paranoid or if this was a time to be genuinely worried what going on he asked dontworry about that right now ginny said soothingly it was clear they were hiding something he didntlike her talking to him as though he was a child as though he was stupid tell me he said angrily what is it harry hermione said slowly but harry was through with being kept in the dark why canti see anyone else he demanded let wait for a healer to check you out again before no harry erupted someone had better tell me what going on right now why wontyou let me see anyone else besides you three ron didntlook at him as he spoke because there isnt anyone else but us mate he said not still alive anyway i was thirteen when i posted the first chapter to this i never could ve imagined that this story would span from a few days after hbp was released to today two days before the release of dh as of this moment this story has achieved half a million hits and more than three thousand reviews you wouldnteven believe me if i told you all of the ways this story was supposed to pan out this result is nothing like my original plan which was only fifteen chapters long it took me exactly two years and now that it done i have no clue what to do next when it comes to writing for harry potter but i only fifteen so i d like to think i ve got a lot of time to figure out my next move i ll say it right now i will never ever ever write a sequel to this now please review to everyone who has done it even once thank you if you ve just read and never reviewed before i know it a pain and i know it doesntseem important but the minute it ll take you to write a sentence or two is absolutely nothing compared to the two years it took me to actually write the story i ve read every comment i ve ever gotten so do it even if you only want to criticize me or say this wasntworth your time thank you for everything i hope everyone enjoys deathly hallows and i dontknow about the rest of you but i ve got my fingers crossed that harry dies pinkdigi disclaimer i dontown harry potter thanks for all the reviews chapter seven when pranks backfire hermione awoke the next morning to a throbbing head her neck was stiff and she felt clammy like the temperature in the weasley house was about a hundred degrees too hot she shifted uncomfortably and felt soreness in her side she tried to remember the events of the previous night but it was all a blur she vaguely remembered firewhisky lots of giggling an enchanted ceiling and wait where was she the pillow her head was resting on wasntnearly as soft as it should ve been she opened her eyes and was instantly greeted by blinding light she winced and shut her eyes again she heard a groan coming from somewhere close to her she forced her eyes open again and saw that her pillow wasnta pillow it was ron she screamed and sat up abruptly instantly regretting it as her head felt like it would blow up her ears were ringing and her eyes couldntfocus on anything bloody hell hermione shut up mumbled ron who was groaning again hermione blinked repeatedly willing her eyes to adjust to the overwhelming brightness when it got slightly better she looked back at ron who was shirtless and holding his head holy shit ron oh bugger off he said waving at her dismissively he looked uncomfortable and his cheeks coloured a bit what what re you wearing she looked down at herself and nearly screamed again she was wearing her shorts from the night before but her top half was clad in only her bra she grabbed the blankets and pulled them up to cover herself ron looked around his bedroom trying not to look at her pretending he hadntseen anything merlin what going on asked hermione what happened i dont i dontknow he sat up slowly looking slightly woozy i cantremember well hello good morning you two hermione looked up mortified as fred and george strolled into the room she heard ron curse under his breath you might want to drink this fred said he handed hermione a glass full of a bubbling bluish brown substance you re mad if you think i drinking anything you give me she mumbled pushing the glass away she looked at ron who eagerly gulped down the potion george had handed him he smiled contentedly ron what drink it it gets rid of the hangover explained ron she gave the potion another nervous glance before drinking it it tasted absolutely horrible she held her breath waiting for her forehead to sprout an arm or her ears to shrivel up and fall off the only thing she noticed however was the significant subsiding of her headache she sighed and handed the cup back to fred smiling gratefully at him dontworry george said noticing the look on ron face mum left really early this morning she didntbother checking in on you she gone off to headquarters with mcgonagall i think they re trying to make the place more inviting for when harry gets there this afternoon it just the six of us again fred said far too enthusiastically for hermione liking dontyou have to be at the shop or something hermione snapped no we put our assistant verity in charge said george poor girl i hope she doesntstumble across our er new development fred said exchanging a concerned look with his twin hermione didnteven want to know what they could be talking about sorry to interrupt said ron irritably but could either of you tell us what happened last night why are we like this demanded hermione you took your clothes off yourselves said george in fact you two were in the middle of a heated snog when we found you he shrugged and fred winked suggestively what hermione screamed ron turned scarlet only joking fred laughed nervously you two were in here pissed out of your minds mumbling something about getting into your pajamas when you both passed out hermione sighed in relief but ron hadntcooled off he glared menacingly at his brothers that doesntexplain he growled why we woke up in my bed what did you bastards do george said relax ronnie it no big deal we had a little fun and threw you two on there fred winked again of course you must ve moved in the night because we didntput you two so close together hermione blushed and tighten her grip on the blankets it was bad enough ron had seen her in her bra she didntwant the rest of his family to as well she cursed herself for not having her wand on her she could ve at least taken comfort in knowing she could hex the two idiots if they tried anything george laughed at the two friends all we wanted to do was give ourselves a laugh we thought that if we stopped by early enough we could wake you up and give you both a good ribbing not to mention a little scare and it worked wonderfully they slapped each other on the back and hermione scowled she was about to get up and walk out when she remembered what she was wearing she was trapped forced to stay there she couldntleave not without having to endure the snide comments and catcalls that she would no doubt receive from george and fred if she walked around topless having been thoroughly embarrassed she buried her face into the blankets not wanting to look at the triumph and sheer enjoyment on their faces as they basked in the glow of yet another practical joke she felt ron hesitantly put a hand on her shoulder and whisper dontpay any attention to them hermione they re gits she smiled into the covers and lifted her head again george gave ron a curious look and the smile slid off his face he turned and gave hermione the same look before nudging fred fred seemed confused for a moment before his smile too disappeared he raised an eyebrow at them and opened his mouth to speak before being cut off by a scream the twins beamed before yelling ginny and ran out of the room ron brothers were incorrigible they had deliberately put him and hermione like that just to embarrass them when they woke up why would they no they didnt know did they of course they didn t they couldn t if they did he was sure they d have said something already although something about the look george gave him right before he and fred ran out of the room gave him an unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomach he was never drinking again okay that was a lie but he d at least wait awhile before taking his next drink he didntparticularly like waking up with a hangover in fact the only reason ron hadntkilled fred and george for their trick was because they d made the hangover potion ron assumed they d covered for the four of them when his mother had asked what had happened to them last night though mostly to save their own arses but no matter how angry he was at his brothers or how embarrassed he was one thing was for sure ron would never forget the image of hermione lying in his bed in only her bra and shorts merlin what did they do to ginny asked hermione sounding alarmed she pushed the blankets off her and being that she was against the wall and ron was on the free side of the bed she hopped over him and planted her feet firmly on the ground she was about to rush out of the room to aid her friend when ron noticed she hadntput on any clothes er hermione she turned around and looked at him he wanted to look at her face he really did but she wasntmaking it easy for him he was hardly discreet as his eyes swept her body taking in the swell of her breasts and smooth flat stomach the curve of her hips that he could clearly see even though she was wearing bottoms bookish though she was she was still a girl yes ron had noticed and though she was usually very conservative it hadnthindered her development in any way her skin looked so soft and he wanted nothing more than to run his hands all over her her bra was black and delicate fabric delicate that was exactly how he d be with hermione he wouldntjust have her for a quick snog which had been the basis of his and lavender relationship he wanted to kiss her not to mention do other things sure but he wanted everything that went along with a relationship he wanted to be able to hold her hand for no reason at all or brush her bushy hair out of her beautiful face just as an excuse to touch her he wanted to row with her in the same way they always had but instead of not speaking for days on end he wanted to hug her and kiss her and finally be able to say he was sorry to her face like he d tried to do so many times in the past bloody hell when had hermione gotten so sexy he was instantly glad that the heat had been nearly unbearable all week forcing everyone to wear their summer clothes her shorts were small and showed off her long smooth legs he wondered what they d feel like if they were wrapped around his waist he bit his lip glad the blankets were covering his lower regions and forced himself to think disgusting thoughts malfoy he thought malfoy smirking and calling him weasel malfoy the death eater hermione punching malfoy during third year she was bloody brilliant so fiery and hermione looked down at herself and blushed ron averted his eyes desperate to calm himself down when he looked back she had folded her arms across her chest and was scanning the area for her missing shirt quidditch exploding snaps homework mcgonagall hagrid nothing worked snape it worked ron cleared his throat and hesitated before standing up reaching for the shirt he d worn the night before which was lying forgotten on the floor he threw it to her here wear this for now he mumbled thanks said hermione catching it and quickly putting it on much to ron disappointment it covered her up quite well it hung down low on her almost to her knees a true testament to their height difference ron felt a swooping sensation in his stomach when she made eye contact he had to say something he should tell her he couldn t he had to hermione you bastards fix this right now i ll hex you to oblivion both of you hermione jumped slightly as the sound of ginny angry shrieks filled the entire house they ran down to her room curious and slightly concerned wondering what was going on fred so help me harry stop laughing i ll make you wish you were never born george ron ran into his sister room and stopped dead in his tracks hermione who had somehow wound up behind him on the stairs slammed into him from behind he would ve asked her if she was alright or helped her get steady but he was far too shocked to think straight he moved deeper into the room hermione following him he heard a gasp escape her lips fred and george were standing beside ginny bed cowering in fear and ginny was standing on her mattress now equal height to the twins harry was flat on ginny bed rolling around in hysterical laughter and occasionally grabbed his head or side ron bit his lip hard not wanting to break down like harry for he knew that his friend would be in for it later ginny was orange and it was hilarious no orange didntbegin to describe it her skin was almost florescent her face her hands arms legs and feet every piece of her that he could see was glowing bright orange ron winced it would look terrible on anybody but her hair only make it even worse holy shit he whispered hermione didnteven yell at him she stood beside him her jaw nearly to the floor what did you two do to her she demanded i ll tell you what they did shouted ginny she winced and clutched her head swaying slightly on her feet but didntstop yelling they slipped me some bloody product last night and now i i orange fred and george much to ron amazement werentlaughing on the contrary they look as if they might soil themselves with fear ron was startled to realize just how similar his little sister was to their mother in that aspect harry chuckling had subsided and he was holding his head painfully his amusement still apparent on his face dontjust stand there hermione said worriedly fix whatever you ve done yes fix it or i swear i ll use the killing curse on you both with pleasure you ll be in loads of trouble with mum if you use magic to george began but stopped abruptly when he got a particularly threatening glare from ginny i dontcare just get rid of this awful colour can t fred said fearfully that he pointed at her face is the work of a tangerine tart the effects last a full twenty four hours what ginny face was contorted into an expression of anger but her skin didntturn its usual bright red ron held back another laugh when he realized it was because she was temporarily orange she d be orange all day he was about to crack a slightly insensitive joke when she sank down onto the bed and burst into tears hermione clicked her tongue against her teeth and harry stopped smiling immediately looking mortified ginny buried her orange face into his chest and sobbed harry put an arm around her and grabbed his wand from his pocket ron had never seen him look so angry and he d seen harry become angry quite often throughout their friendship if looks could kill well his brothers wouldntstill be standing he didntlike the way harry was pointing his wand at fred and george but had to admit he was slightly pleased with the way harry was defending ginny he decided he d allow harry to hold her like that for now she was upset and he was comforting her but if he tried anything ron would kill him the only reason ron hadntalready beaten harry to a bloody pulp for dumping ginny was because he was ron best friend but he wouldntbe able to contain his rage if harry hurt his sister again he was a weasley and nobody messed with a weasley especially one particular weasley the one who had six older temperamental brothers harry was practically a brother to him but ginny was his sister by blood and he d be damned if he let anyone take advantage of her ginny wasnta pushover by any means but she wanted harry badly enough that ron knew she d let him do practically anything he hoped harry would keep his hands to himself he wasntallowed to have ginny until the final battle was over and done with so ginny could be safe and harry wouldntfeel the need to deny her if either of you value your lives you ll figure out a way to fix this i dontbloody care what you do but if she isntback to normal within two hours you ll be the ones to pay he growled fred and george took a few steps back and harry continued to hold his wand out menacingly she might not be able to use magic but i am and so help me i wonthesitate to hex you both harry woke up to a rather painful headache at first he thought it was his scar burning but he quickly remembered that he had had quite a bit of firewhisky last night he felt rather than saw ginny asleep her head resting on his chest he sighed and ran his fingers through her flaming red hair he shut his eyes and tried to fall back asleep hoping it wasnttoo early and that his hangover wouldntbe as severe by the time he had to leave the room and face mrs weasley he listened to ginny calm even breathing and was almost on the brink of sleep when he felt her stirring she groaned and sat up slowly hey whispered harry hey she said my head hurts yeah so does mine he laughed harry squinted in the dark of her room trying to see her face something looked strange she looked different he vaguely remembered fred or was it george saying something last night about ginny being angry when she awoke she didntseem angry to harry what else had they said he searched his memory trying to remember their conversation oh he could somewhat see her through the light coming in from the curtains of her window but he needed to be absolutely sure he pulled his wand out of his pocket and muttered lumos his suspicions were confirmed her face was orange his eyes went wide and his first instinct was to burst out laughing he sniggered and sat up to get a better look at her it wasntjust her face it was her entire body all of her skin was a bright orange in colour what asked ginny harry offered a weak smile and said maybe you should look in the mirror he unlocked her door as she opened her curtains allowing more light inside he tucked his wand away praying that she didntreact badly to her appearance walking over to her mirror she gaped in shock and her hands flew to her face then she screamed moments later fred and george were in her room looking thoroughly pleased with themselves harry exploded into laughter ignoring the pain in his head and he did so ginny rushed over to him and smacked him with her pillow only causing him to laugh ever harder she jumped onto the bed standing tall and glared at her brothers harry felt tears streaming down his cheeks as he watched her her back was to him but he didntneed to see her face in order to imagine the look on it only now she was orange as well he felt slightly like hermione the night before when she couldntstop laughing over the silliest of things there was a stitch in his side but he still couldntcontrol himself he was giggling like an idiot and didntcare even her feet were orange he wasnteven aware of what was going on around him until he heard ron curse followed by hermione demanding an explanation he forced himself to focus on what was happening though he didnttake his eyes off of her neck it was almost the same colour as her hair it was truly unfortunate that she was a redhead if it hadntclashed so terribly with her red locks she might ve even appreciated the joke it was rather funny in harry opinion he watched as the small girl whipped out her wand and threatened to kill the twins the look of terror on the faces of fred and george who were still almost taller than her even though she was standing on her bed was nothing short of hysterical one of them explained that the spell wouldntwear off for an entire day without warning she flopped down onto the bed and cried harry didntknow what to do he hadntexpected her to cry and he definitely hadntexpected the overwhelming anger that welled up inside of him when she did her stupid bastard brothers the ones who harry had given his money to so they could start their joke shop had done this to her harry felt directly responsible without him there never would ve been a tangerine tart for her to eat he did the only thing he could think of he whipped out his wand and threatened them harry pleaded hermione calm down harry turned to glare at her not really angry at her but irritated that she was interfering ron stepped in front of her protectively looking uneasily at harry wand we cantfix it we haventgot an antidote for it explained george it wears off in a day i dontsee what she so concerned about said fred ginny gave another loud sob and harry didntlower his wand he was almost shaking with fury he honestly didntsee a problem with murdering the two prats right there then you d better get on it because i wasntjoking when i said you have two hours he said evenly his voice was calm but he was nothing of the sort harry you re wasting valuable time muttered harry whoa wait a second here fred said what exactly d you think you re going to do to us he sounded almost as if he was mocking harry harry potter was not to be taken lightly especially when it came to the girl he lo his thoughts came to a crashing halt and he stared blankly at the twins for a moment before tightening his grip on his wand why dontyou stick around and find out i d be more than willing to teach you a lesson about pranking ginny fred opened his mouth to argue but george elbowed him in the ribs we ll just leave now and see if we can find an antidote he said harry nodded but said nothing the twins apparated out of the bedroom and harry returned his wand to his pocket he looked awkwardly at ron who had some mixture of a grin and a glare on his face and hermione who looked downright shocked he surveyed their clothing hermione was wearing ron shirt and he wasntsure if there was anything underneath it ron was wearing wrinkled trousers and harry guessed hermione had his shirt on because his chest was bare so said harry a playful smile tugging at his lips what did you two do last night his smile quickly vanished when hermione looked at her feet and ron blushed furiously hermione glided over to the bed and put a comforting hand on ginny back the room was silent except for ginny occasional sob and it was then that harry noticed how terrible his headache truly was he groaned and using the hand that wasntwrapped protectively around ginny clutched his forehead again ron left the room and returned a few minutes later carrying two glasses filled with a disgusting looking potion drink he ordered handing a glass to harry he gave ron a worried look it ll get rid of that headache harry snatched the drink out of his hands and guzzled it down quickly trying not to gag why was it that every potion in the world that was supposed to help him also made him want to retch he automatically didntcare as he felt the sudden relief of his pounding head ginny pulled away from harry and took the other drink from her brother she made a face as she drank but immediately sighed and offered everyone a weak smile sorry she apologized wiping her eyes i didntmean to explode like that what they did was horrible hermione said honestly i dontfind it funny in the least it not that bad ron lied he offered her a reassuring smile it ll wear off by tomorrow it had better wear off in a few hours if those idiots know what good for them ginny laughed she shot harry an appreciative look thanks for scaring them but i doubt they ll come up with anything and besides i think mum might get mad if you murder them mrs weasley came home half an hour later harry was upstairs dressing but he was alerted of her presence when he heard her screaming he smiled and followed the noise ron hot on his trail he found the woman red faced and arms flailing pacing around the room as hermione and ginny looked on i specifically told them they werentallowed to use any products on any of you when i get my hands on them oh ginny why would you take something like that from them anyway ginny looked at hermione for help she couldntexactly say that she d been intoxicated when it had happened that would get fred and george in some highly deserved trouble yes but she d also be in hot water for drinking i didntrealize mumbled ginny she noticed harry and ron for the first time and shot them a pleading look they both shrugged and wisely kept their distance well go upstairs and get ready because we have to be at grimmauld place in an hour mrs weasley said ginny eyes went wide no i not going i refuse to be seen like this outside of the house you donthave a choice argued mrs weasley i cantleave you alone look what happened the last time i trusted you lot to be responsible but mum ginevra weasley mrs weasley said in a dangerous tone you are coming whether you like it or not now you can waste an hour complaining and end up arriving at headquarters in your wrinkled clothes and unwashed face or you can go upstairs and fix yourself up ginny sighed and went up the stairs harry chest constricted and he felt a sudden nervousness in his stomach he was going back to grimmauld place to officially become a member of the order of the phoenix this would go down as one of the worst days in ginny life and for a girl who had spent her life being slightly ignored by her parents and six older brothers had been possessed by voldemort narrowly escaped death twice in the past two years not to mention been dumped by the boy she d had a mad crush on since she was ten that was saying something grimmauld place was it usual gloomy self although it seemed cleaner than usual ginny guessed it was because that filthy house elf kreacher wasntthere to make a mess of things scum blood traitors disgusting creatures filth besmirching the house of my fathers that old hag was getting on ginny last nerve if she had the ability to use magic she would ve whipped out her wand and blown a hole though that bloody wall ages ago sirius had mentioned something about a permanent sticking charm but he never said anything about what would happen if the entire wall was taken down she was sure harry wouldnthave minded if she destroyed some of his house to top it all off there was a substantial amount of order members present all of whom she knew rather well and saw on a weekly basis at headquarters for harry introduction they were all were either staring rudely at her or avoiding eye contact altogether she was orange yes but she wasnta mutant the others didntseem to be having a good time either harry was uncomfortable and understandably so this was his godfather house he hadntbeen in it since sirius was alive ginny couldntimage how hard it must ve been for him to stay there she was half expecting the man to trudge into the room any minute now a thought that only broke her heart when she remembered the truth about poor sirius and the fact that she d never see him again ron and hermione were slightly more cheerful than harry though ginny noticed they were acting strange around each other they were sitting on the same couch but on opposite ends as far away as they could possible be while on the same piece of furniture she could lie down in the space they d left between themselves bill arrived shortly after they did with the twins behind him ginny looked at harry who was shooting them a death glare we er couldntfind anything to make it go away immediately admitted george looking almost afraid take this fred said handing a small pill to ginny it ll speed up the fading process you know so you wontbe so and why should i believe you demanded ginny she was still furious with her brothers the mangy gits we arentthe brightest blokes around said george but we know better than to give you something else with mum around here somewhere no doubt ready to murder us as it is ginny tentatively took the pill and swallowed it she turned to hermione well any difference hermione offered a small smile it looks a little lighter she said hopefully it isntas bright as before it ll still take a bit to fully work explained fred i dontsee what the big deal is of course it was just a harmless joke ginny was about to curse loudly at them when mcgonagall entered the room when her eyes scanned the room and fell on ginny she gave a surprised gasp before looking at bill and nodding the eldest weasley child smiled in recognition and left the room dragging fred and george with him if you re ready she said to harry we ll see you now we ve assembled only the most trusted of all the order members to be here today arthur molly and bill weasley nymphadora tonks remus lupin alastor moody kingsley shaklebolt and myself of course did you bring the note with you er yeah said harry he stood up and reached into his pocket handing her the crumple up note that ginny knew to be the one found in the fake horcrux the one from r a b harry awkwardly looked at the other people in the room i trust that mr weasley and miss granger accompanying you harry nodded he started to leave before pausing and turning back to face ginny he worried his lip and regarded her for a moment she assumed he was trying to make eye contact trying to make sure that she wasntangry at him for not including her she stubbornly looked away she couldnthelp feeling slightly bitter and envious as she watched hermione and ron desert her to go talk about important secretive things she knew it wasntharry fault of course and that her mother was the one keeping her out of the loop but it didnthelp that her brother who was less than twenty months older than her was being thrown into the mix actually professor would it be okay if ginny came too her head snapped back in harry direction he was staring at her with a concerned expression on his face she could tell he didntreally want her there but also realized that she deserved to be there she had earned the right to be included her brother glared at harry cursing him under his breath hermione smiled at her molly wishes that her daughter be kept out of this business until she is of legal age mcgonagall informed him ginny heart sank there was no way harry would be able to override her mum authority and even if he could he wouldntdare ginny was yet to meet someone who wasn t on one level or another frightened of molly weasley yes i aware harry said calmly but if i going to be in charge i going to want to be surrounded by people that i trust he winked at ginny i know i have to respect mrs weasley wishes and so i not asking that ginny be able to join the order or participate in the missions i am however asking that she sit in on the meetings potter miss weasley is one of the brightest witches i know he interjected ginny was getting nervous she had never seen anyone stand up to her mother or professor mcgonagall let alone at the same time she might be able to offer insight into some of the matters i see your point said mcgonagall but she is only fifteen and she has already fought death eaters in two separate instances both times having escaped without any serious injury which correct me if i am wrong is more than i can say for some of the trained aurors who were present at those battles harry said forcefully and she ll be sixteen in a week and a half if it helps ginny smiled inwardly it felt amazing to hear harry talking about her like that as if she was some powerful accomplished witch she has more than proven that she can handle anything we throw at her she clever and capable and as much as i hate to admit it i think she d be quite good as an order member he continued ron face had turned about the same colour of ginny magically altered one and his hands were balled into fists his knuckles now white mcgonagall looked about ready to object again when he said i know i know she cantjoin the order i ve already agreed with you on that but i want her there and i not just saying this because i want all my friends to be at the meetings with me because honestly i d prefer it if none of them were wrapped up into this but they are and i cantchange that now ron opened his mouth to speak but hermione elbowed him in the ribs and shook her head he wisely shut his mouth though he didntlook as if he d calmed down any mcgonagall was standing with her hands on her hips looking up at harry who was still arguing his point apart from me she the only living person on our side to be in any type of contact with voldemort in the past sixteen years she deserves to at least sit in on a conversation about him dontyou think asked harry i think so yes agreed mcgonagall unfortunately it is not what i think but what is best for her that is important absolutely you re right what best for all of us is a very important issue for the order harry said ginny was confused a minute ago he was arguing with professor mcgonagall and now he was folding she was about to salvage his dignity and just tell him to go on without her when he got a stubborn look on his face a smile played on his lips as he said however i think we d all agree that the best thing would be for voldemort to be gone isntthat correct yes nodded mcgonagall though she still didntseem understand ginny didntunderstand either good he lowered his voice you ve heard the prophecy professor you know that i the er chosen one as everyone puts it she nodded quickly and he continued then allow me to offer you a choice you either allow ginny to participate in the meeting or i refuse to attend are you giving me an ultimatum potter now now ultimatum is such a harsh word harry grinned and appeared to think about it but yes i suppose i am giving you one hermione gasped and ron finally calmed down as the two looked on ginny couldntcontain her grin as professor mcgonagall appeared truly shocked mcgonagall turned and stared at ginny who instantly wiped the smile from her face and gave her a pleading look fine she concurred but if i catch you so much as breathing the wrong way you re out got it got it ginny said nodding furiously under no circumstances are you allowed to attend the missions until you are seventeen years of age do you understand i understand ginny and professor mcgonagall engaged in a staring contest for several seconds before mcgonagall nodded and said very well then she looked back at harry i dontappreciate the situation you ve put me in i sorry for that really but this is important and i wouldntdo this if i didntthink she could handle it you ll see she ll be very useful i promise he said quietly so quietly that ginny had to struggle to make out what he had said mcgonagall nodded stiffly and walked out of the room beckoning them to follow her ron and hermione went eagerly but ginny grabbed harry arm and the two lingered behind thank you she said appreciatively i know you dontwant me there but yeah well said harry i thought about what you said that day in the attic you were right i guess this is your fight too and you deserve to at least know what going on her breathing hitched and she was tempted to ask him something that she wasntsupposed to ask until bill wedding but she caught herself just in time did you see ron face i thought he was going to explode harry laughed he ll get over it you think if he wants to be invited to the next meeting he d be smart to control himself during this one said harry he smiled and touched her cheek it doesntlook that bad anymore y know whatever fred gave you it worked it faded a bit well i hope so she said looking up at him i was as orange as a bloody pumpkin maybe he grinned but you still looked beautiful before i start getting reviews saying her name is virginia weasley no it actually ginevra check out jk rowling official website under characters found in the extra section for those of you who dontbelieve dontforget to review disclaimer i dontown harry potter but a girl can dream right thanks for all the reviews over 200 wow chapter eight the meeting what is she doing here mrs weasley demanded when harry and ginny entered the room she mr weasley bill kingsley tonks lupin mcgonagall moody ron and hermione were sitting around a large table mcgonagall merely shook her head and pointed accusingly at harry harry smiled and saw ginny stop dead in her tracks he knew what was going to happen mrs weasley was going to bully him into having ginny leave the meeting he would feel guilty for going against her she let him into her home he was on her clock and would wind up backing down and accepting tmrs weasley realize that this was bigger than her not wanting ginny to discuss voldemort with them couldntshe understand that her daughter might actually be useful harry had already fought with mcgonagall something he never thought he d do and he wasntabout to give in now he stood his ground she sitting in on the meeting mrs weasley explained harry he tried to sound polite the last thing he wanted to do was offend her but it was important to him that ginny be present and he wasntgoing to take no for an answer no she most certainly is not said mrs weasley her voice loud and annoyed ginny is not of legal age and as her parent i forbidding her from attending this meeting a flicker of annoyance passed through him as well fine said harry mrs weasley smiled triumphantly call us when you re through then he turned to ginny and nodded encouragingly telling her to follow his lead come on gin let go where do you think you re going potter mad eye moody called after them harry turned back to face them again he smiled with false innocence and said to the kitchen to get something to eat i rather famished this isntthe time for food boy this meeting revolves around you moody said see that what i thought too harry said he knew he was about to get nasty and was surprised that he didntfeel awkward or nervous about lecturing a group full of adults i want ginny to be here but since that obviously wonthappen i forced to wonder if anything i have to say will have any impact at all of course it will be harry lupin said soothingly haventyou heard from here on out you re in charge harry shrugged apparently i not he wanted to show them that he meant business and if that meant walking out of the meeting so be it he was stubborn all the way down to his toes i ve already explained to professor mcgonagall that i think ginny deserves to be here he looked at mrs weasley whether some of you want her to be or not well potter moody growled sarcastically drawing harry attention back to the man with the magical eye forgive us for not accepting the idea of being bossed around by a child with open arms harry felt his blood boil he wasnta child why didntanyone understand that hadnthe proved by now that he could handle things that a simple child couldn t first of all snapped harry i not a child i seventeen incase you didntknow moody rolled his normal eye and secondly perhaps you shouldntcomplain about the fact that i bossing you around and should instead focus on more important questions such as what the hell did i do wrong that a mere seventeen year old has been put in charge of me now unless you have any other snide remarks ginny and i are leaving he saw ginny staring at him in shock she offered him a weak smile you arentas important as you think potter moody barked harry gritted his teeth and balled his fists something about moody had always rubbed him the wrong way but this was too much really argued harry that funny because what i think is that we re standing in my house right now what i think is that i ve been asked to lead the order missions a job that i fairly certain you werentconsidered for what i think is that if i dontfeel like fighting voldemort you ll end up dead or in the crazy ward at st mungo s what i think is that you need to swallow your pride and suck it up because i sure it wouldntexactly be a confidence booster if i pointed out the fact that regardless of what you say i am still the one giving the orders here or if i told you that i didntwant you involved as far as my missions are concerned the room was silent as harry and moody glared at each other he felt an overwhelming sense of pride and thrill course through his veins as he realized what he just said had he really said those things to a room full of respected aurors and other important witches and wizards ginny was gazing at harry with a new sense of admiration ron and hermione hadntmoved or spoken since the arguing began but both looked rather pleased by it all perhaps they were just relieved that his temper wasntbeing directed at them for once moody seemed oddly calm and composed harry detected something in his non magical eye something that oddly resembled respect moody gave a small nod and couldntkeep the grin off of his old face as he stared rather impressed at harry please stay harry requested tonks harry smiled warmly at tonks whose hair was down to the middle of her back and a brilliant shade of blue i aware that it going to be awkward for most of you having to take orders from he looked amusedly at moody a child but i hope you can all get past it rather quickly the point of me being put in charge as you say isntto sacrifice your dignity it because i well he stopped and looked around the room he contemplated what he was about to say feeling assured that everyone in the room could be trusted the weasleys would never betray him lupin was the last marauder the last remaining connection to harry parents he needed harry just as much as harry needed him tonks was somewhat of a sister to him she knew sirius she had been his relative and she was the only one who felt a loss like he did when sirius died kingsley shacklebolt had proven time and time again that he was reliable and clearly on their side alastor moody provided that this was the real moody and not another imposter was trustworthy as well though he could be a little threatening at times and mcgonagall already knew as did hermione ginny and ron he continued quietly let just say they arentcalling me the chosen one for nothing everybody looked rather surprised at his announcement not because they hadntalready expected as much but because harry wasntone to reveal such private information we understand arthur said bill nodded so harry said feeling confident once more you re all going to listen to me there was a loud reply of yes coming from everyone except ginny hermione and ron who were watching harry with disbelief they had seen him in this position before when he had led the da meetings and when they had flown off to the department of mysteries but they had never expected to see this side of him again today under these circumstances he was being a leader he had these adults hanging wrapped around his finger you ll respect my decisions even if you dontalways agree with them asked harry focusing his attention on mrs weasley once again the order members molly weasley included responded with a yes good harry said walking deeper into the room pull up a chair ginny we have order business to discuss the order meeting had been nothing like ginny imagined it to be it was mostly mcgonagall and other members talking about recent attacks and all the other occurrences that ginny had already heard about through the daily prophet some of the facts were different as expected but the general concept had not varied of course she wasntcomplaining she was so thrilled that she was finally included that she didnteven become bored as kingsley shacklebolt droned on and on she hung on his every word though everyone else had long since tuned out and stared at him with slight awe and admiration letting it sink in that she was at an order meeting when she noticed harry was staring at her with a curious expression on his face she blushed and avoided looking at kingsley for the rest of the conference she avoided looking at harry as well but for different reasons she was still in utter shock and disbelief he had defended her and stood up to her mother that had never happened before as far as ginny knew and she had close to sixteen years of experience in that area she was rather impressed and to be perfectly honest turned on by the way he hadnttaken any flack from anyone even someone as scary as a tag team of her mum and mad eye moody he had done it for her he hadntgained anything by standing up to them all other than a small bit of respect perhaps but she had what he said made the difference between her sitting in on the meeting and her sitting down in the kitchen waiting anxiously with fred and george as the others finished she held back a grin as she pictured her idiot brothers complaining because she was allowed insider information while they were forbidden from attending she scanned the area half expecting to find an extendable ear but remembered that mcgonagall had placed an imperturbable charm on the room after ginny and harry sat down and the discussion began harry wasnttalking nearly as much as ginny had expected him to in fact she wasntsure if he d spoken at all since mcgonagall and kingsley took over she knew that the purpose of this small gathering was to bring harry up to speed but she never realized that they d need to talk a lot in order to do so and now that we are all on the same page mcgonagall said when kingsley finished his monologue i will turn the floor over to harry she nodded in his direction and everyone focused their attention on him everybody present and only everybody present have been told about the horcruxes nobody outside of this room should have any information on them she said forcefully giving meaningful looks to everyone at the table she turned to harry they only have the general idea of what a horcrux is they know that they re a way to preserve someone soul and that voldemort has used many seven as far as we know now potter if you would please let us in on the important details you and albus had discussed as even i do not know them okay harry said standing up dumbledore showed me a bunch of memories he d collected using the penseive in his office the point was to teach me about voldemort explained harry the memories i was shown took me through voldemort life detailing his thirst for power and the reasons why he wanted to eliminate any bad blood in the wizarding world ron scoffed and stared at harry expectantly waiting for him to go on ginny bit back a laugh as everyone in the room turned to glare at her brother i canteven begin to explain anything without telling you about his past so i need to start there said harry just bear with me please voldemort mum merope lived with her brother morfin and their father marvolo marvolo was the heir of salazar slytherin merope fell in love with a muggle from the town named tom riddle that a bit rich said bill you know who a half blood and he thinks he has the right to weed out other half bloods the hypocrisy of lord voldemort is not the topic of discussion said mcgonagall though she looked rather amused continue potter right well merope used a love potion and tricked tom riddle into marrying her after a while though tom came to his senses and left her continued harry by then merope was pregnant she gave birth at an orphanage intending to give her baby up once he was born and died almost immediately after but before she did she made sure her baby was named tom marvolo riddle ginny shuddered having heard that name far too many times for her liking but said nothing growing up voldemort bullied all the kids at the orphanage he would always take their things and hide them in his room as dumbledore said he liked to collect trophies for whenever he did something he thought was particularly great when dumbledore went there to tell him about hogwarts and bring him to school the woman who ran the place told him that he did weird frightening things like what inquired kingsley once on some trip with the other kids voldemort brought two of them into a cave with him when they came out the two were odd oh yeah said harry voldemort figured it must ve been his dad who was magical not his mum but when he discovered that it was the other way around he instantly hated his father and by association all muggles when he got out of hogwarts he tracked down his uncle morfin and stole morfin wand he used it to kill his father tom riddle senior and his grandparents he of course framed morfin for the whole thing naturally lupin said a smile playing at his lips then awhile later harry recounted voldemort went to this woman house they knew each other it seemed the woman was some distant descendant of helga hufflepuff and she showed him a cup that once belonged to hufflepuff and a locket with the slytherin mark on it voldemort ended up killing her harry paused apparently waiting for someone to interject but nobody spoke they were all listening intently watching him ginny was amazed at how easily voldemort could kill but then she remembered that he tried to kill harry when he was only a baby you had to be truly evil to do that to even think about dong that horace slughorn was the one who told him about horcruxes and what they did that when voldemort got the bright idea to make seven of them yes but how does knowing you know who life story help us to find these horcruxes tonks asked he liked to collect trophies remember me saying that harry said everyone nodded when he framed his uncle for murder he stole slytherin ring something morfin had because he was the new heir of slytherin after marvolo died he turned it into a horcrux and dumbledore found it in the ruins of morfin house he destroyed it ginny looked around the room there were many confused faces around the table everybody was practically on the edge of their seats waiting for the moment that harry would say something important and everyone would understand when he killed that woman he stole the hufflepuff cup and the slytherin locket from her he made those into horcruxes too harry said he hides important pieces in places that are equally important to him so it just a matter of knowing where to look asked lupin not exactly no you need to know what you re looking for which is why examining voldemort past is so crucial because we wouldnthave known anything without doing so voldemort diary harry eyes lingered on ginny which he gave to lucius malfoy for safekeeping was another horcrux i destroyed it in my second year we ve already found two which means we have five to go is that right mr weasley asked i not exactly sure answered harry the locket was hidden in the cave where he took those kids when he was young that where i was the night hogwarts got invaded i was with dumbledore and we went to find it when we got there it had already been stolen and there was a note left which professor mcgonagall will probably show you later judging by what the note says though i fairly certain that it been destroyed we re down to four stated moody three actually harry corrected you have to keep in mind that one horcrux is literally inside of voldemort we only need to find three more one is obviously the cup mcgonagall said but what are the other two i almost positive that one is something that previously belonged to rowena ravenclaw said harry voldemort tried to collect something from all four founders but he never succeeded on getting something of gryffindor s i know that for sure and professor dumbledore believed that the final one is voldemort snake is that wise though asked hermione a snake already has a soul yeah it sounds bloody stupid to me agreed harry but dumbledore and i both agreed that voldemort was planning on making his final horcrux after he killed me and since that never happened he had to improvise when do we start what harry asked when do we start lupin repeated we need to look for these horcruxes dontwe it not that cut and dry harry said we need to research and visit a lot of places before we can do anything if we make even one wrong move voldemort will know everything and we ll be in danger of course he bound to know a bit since snape is with him now he added bitterly but not everything what your plan harry asked mr weasley ginny crossed her fingers under the table and hoped that it included her in some important way or another i want hermione to assist with the research checking facts and dates and looking for a possible object that can be linked to rowena ravenclaw if that okay with her he said nodding at hermione anything i can do to help i ll do she smiled great i want ron to help plan the missions he ll basically help whenever we get a lead and need to check it out that means harry explained looking at ron now that you and hermione will probably need to communicate a lot no fighting allowed hermione and ron nodded sheepishly ron you ll also come up with strategies always staying two steps ahead just like in chess ron laughed i ve got it covered ginny continued harry you ll mostly be helping hermione or ron whichever one needs you you cantcome with us when we retrieve the horcruxes though i know you d be very useful she smiled and felt warmth inside of her that she was sure wasntcaused by the summer heat outside harry thought she d be useful oh if only her mum would let her go with them since you ll be staying behind on the missions if any order members get hurt i d appreciate it if you could help heal them it would look too suspicious if everyone went to st mungo s y know so if they arentserious injuries we ll be forced to heal them ourselves there will be first aid kits and i sure we can get a few healers in the order to help but we ll need you is that okay yeah i can do it harry she said so when d you think we ll start the missions ron asked excitedly why does it matter to you mrs weasley snapped i going mum so is hermione yelled ron defensively no you aren t yes i am harry knock some sense into this boy tell him he isntgoing demanded mrs weasley ginny held her breath and studied harry sure that he would crack and give in to her mother harry looked uneasily at her he going mrs weasley hermione is too ron head hurt he had never heard his mother scream so much in his entire life and that was a huge revelation his mother always screamed about one thing or another his earliest memory was of her yelling at fred and george for trying to prank him in some way or another speaking of fred and george ron was glad that they had gone back to the shop because they were getting on his last nerve glad we got that out of the way muttered harry when the four friends collapsed on the two couches in the sitting room ginny sat down beside harry so ron sat beside hermione there was no longer that uncomfortable tension between them like there had been prior to the meeting arguing was what they did best and for once it was directed at someone other than each other that was huge for them and in a way it was a semi breakthrough i feel like i need another hangover potion ginny laughed oh i ve completely forgotten about my skin am i still as orange as before honestly ron had forgotten about her skin too it was strange how quickly he d gotten used to her looking like that no answered hermione whatever it was that fred gave you it worked really well you re almost back to normal yeah they re lucky grumbled harry ron smirked at his friend he was about to speak when harry looked up at him and said you never did answer my question what question what happened with you two last night ron felt his face heat up let just say that ginny wasntthe only one to suffer courtesy of the twins hermione sighed what does that mean ginny asked curiously hermione laughed ron looked around the room desperate to not meet anybody eyes hermione was about to tell their story and he almost couldntbear the sheer humiliation of it all when i woke up this morning i was in your brother bed in almost nothing but my knickers she recalled ron had to look at his friends when he heard ginny gasp his sister mouth was wide open in shock and harry eyes were significantly larger than usual it was just a silly joke ron said hastily we passed out and they put us in there because they knew we d wake up and be mortified he couldnthelp the bitterness in his voice though he had to admit it was rather nice waking up to hermione perhaps if she hadntscreamed he would ve had time to enjoy it my brothers undressed you those sick bastards cried ginny no they didn t said hermione i was already undressed in ron room asked harry yes ron and hermione said in unison you were undressed asked ginny yes they said together in ron bedroom harry asked again yes hermione sounded annoyed and ron sounded embarrassed ginny gave them a skeptical look you two didnt no are you sure she asked positive ron lied he wasntactually sure what happened last night he couldntremember anything after an enchanted ceiling in the drawing room how had they gotten back to the bedroom anyway we were getting on our pajamas laughed hermione why dontask i have no clue why hermione said she sounded rather exasperated wisely neither ginny nor harry asked any more questions regarding the matter they sat in comfortable silence for awhile ron started thinking about grimmauld place he hadntbeen there since two christmases ago when his dad had been bitten by the snake and harry dreamt about it he d never forget that christmas his father had almost died he learned that harry may have been getting possessed by you know who and he finally met neville parents in the closed ward of st mungo s add in lockhart and kreacher and you ve got yourself one hell of a christmas remember when buckbeak was right upstairs asked hermione apparently she had been thinking about the house they were currently in just as ron had how did the floor not cave in from his weight i imagine that a hippogriffis rather heavy sirius probably had someone magically enforce the floor said harry ron froze he hadntheard harry willingly talk about sirius since the department of mysteries probably murmured hermione ron was desperate to steer the conversation away from sirius remember when mum made us clean out this entire place he asked yeah said harry we found loads of junk some of it was rather nice though objected ginny i really liked that she paused and got a strange look on her face after a moment she gasped so loud that ron almost couldntbelieve it had come from her small body she immediately got to her feet and looked at ron hermione and harry with an expression of utmost shock and excitement on her face she covered her mouth with her hand and gave a squeal of course that it she squeaked what it hermione asked ron was relieved to find that he was not the only clueless person in the room and also pleasantly surprised that hermione didntimmediately understand what was going on it was comforting to see her looking puzzled for once what we ve what you the merlin ginny spit it out ron bellowed why didntwe think of it before his sister asked more to herself than anyone else it so obvious what obvious demanded harry just tell us already she remained silent for a moment her brow furrowed and her face scrunched in deep thought it it had to be there no other place she muttered she looked up excitement dancing behind her eyes it here with that she scurried off leaving the confused trio in her wake what was that all about asked hermione when ginny was gone you do that to us all the time exclaimed ron it bloody annoying isntit hermione went upstairs an hour later to find ginny tearing through drawers cupboards and any other place she could find what are you doing ginny jumped and whirled around to face her merlin dontsneak up on me like that you nearly scared me to death sorry said hermione though she didntfeel all that sorry but what are you doing in here if harry catches you in here going through the drawers you re in big trouble maybe not ginny beamed i think i ve just figured out something important i not sure yet though i need to keep looking do me a favour and tell me if you hear harry coming hermione nodded and ginny turned back to what she was doing hermione looked around the dusty bedroom one that had been vacant for a whole year she had never been in this room when it was his bedroom but then again it would ve been rather inappropriate if she had been in there inappropriate kind of like snooping through all of his things like ginny was doing hermione gingerly walked deeper into the room and sat down on the bed she put her hands up against the cold wall and could feel the energy that was still housed within the room the pillows were dirty and if hermione were to hit them she could be sure dust would rise up into her face there werentmany personal effects in the room as she noticed upon further inspection of her surroundings three pictures were visible one of sirius lily and james another of sirius and harry and the last of the three true marauders but judging by a gaping hole to the right of remus lupin hermione could tell that peter pettigrew had also been there but had been magically removed the curtains were probably home to several doxies and the window beneath the curtains was dirty and looked like it needed a good cleaning everything in this room looked like it needed a good cleaning but thought hermione there nobody here to clean it anymore they d never gotten to celebrate the anniversary of sirius black death perhaps they were too wrapped up with dumbledore passing or the closing of hogwarts or thinking about horcruxes or preparations for the wedding because they never really sat down and acknowledged that it had been a year since sirius went through the veil school had been cut short so they had been on summer holidays on his anniversary hermione had known which day it was not by looking at a calendar though she had used one to double check but because hedwig hadntshown up at the burrow with a letter on that particular day she ron and ginny exchanged messages with harry via owls rather often sometimes even twice or three times a day harry had mentioned in one of his earlier letters that he greatly enjoyed the way his uncle hollered every time an owl flew into the house but hermione knew his fervor for communication with them was due to loneliness and the fact that he missed them nobody said anything about it or bothered to owl harry and ask if he was alright when they didntreceive a letter from him that day as ginny pointed out when mrs weasley decided he was depressed and needed to be rescued from his aunt and uncle house immediately harry hadntmoped around or complained once about sirius he had bounced back almost as if it d never happened as if sirius was still at grimmauld place waiting for their next visit dontyou think ginny had said that he earned one day of grieving so they let harry grieve at the burrow however there would be no time for grieving the wedding was soon approaching and many important details were yet to be decided and confirmed it was a madhouse not once during the entire twenty four hours of the day marking the death of sirius did anyone light a candle say a prayer or do anything else as a tribute they waited until the next morning when hedwig arrived during breakfast before writing their friend and life went on life was still going on but as hermione sat on her dead friend bed and looked around his empty room she realized that it hadn t not really they were right back where they d been a year ago only sirius was missing he wasntupstairs feeding buckbeak or locked in a room with the other members of the order discussing their next move he was dead wandering beyond some strange veil and he would never come back sirius wasntthere to sleep in his bed or change his clothes or even to yell awful things at kreacher he was gone they d never see him again hermione had gotten used to not seeing sirius they hadntseem him very much in previous years while away at hogwarts anyway but the fact hit her now in a way that she hadntexpected she felt tears sting her eyes as she curled her feet up underneath her body and rested against the wall she was so consumed in her thoughts that she hadntnoticed harry enter the room what re you doing he demanded ron came in behind him ginny dropped the object she d been holding and quickly spun around casting a dangerous look at hermione who was supposed to warn her about harry what in bloody hell d you think you re doing hermione hastily wiped her eyes but made no effort to get up and help ginny explain she was rather curious as to what the girl was doing and was half hoping harry would crack her and she d confess to whatever crazy plan she d developed dontbe mad pleaded ginny but i going through his things yeah i got that harry said dryly why he never went through your things the look on his face told hermione that while he acted strong deep down he was still the lonely little boy who desperately wanted nothing more than to not be who he was the famous harry potter the boy who had lost anyone and everyone he cared about she had a newfound understanding and respect for why harry had broken up with ginny though she still didntagree with what they were currently doing ginny looked frantically at hermione and ron begging them for help i i know that i he didn t she muttered i thought you d be happy why would i be happy that you re rifling through sirius old things because said ginny looking exasperated i ve just found your bloody horcrux disclaimer i dontown harry potter chapter nine the horcrux you what asked harry his disbelief evident in his tone she couldnthave found a horcux not at grimmauld place i found a horcrux ginny said slowly as if she were talking to a first year where asked ron from somewhere behind harry here ginny said simply before turning back to sirius things she sat down on the floor and began digging through piles of old possessions muttered incoherently harry turned to hermione whose eyes were glistening in an unusual way and noticed the curious expression she wore catching her eye she shrugged but didntget up from the bed when harry glanced at ron he found the same expression on his friend face he walked over to ginny and dropped to his knees she didntlook up what d you mean asked harry had she lost her mind sirius didnthave a horcrux he would ve told harry if he had he felt his stomach tense uncomfortably as ginny continued muttering and picked through the pile of things more determinedly gin would you quit searching for one second and explain to us what you re going on about she sighed looking extremely put out she shifted to face them i ve found a horcrux harry you ve already said that said hermione from the bed harry who was still on his knees beside ginny looked up at ron for help ron then added yeah what re you talking about how could you have found one here y know said ginny angrily you lot could at least pretend to believe it possible that i right instead of staring at me like i should be locked up in st mungo or something hermione was the first to react we re sorry ginny but this is very surprising we were hanging out and you suddenly ran out of the room mumbling something that none of us understood and now you re looking for a horcrux in sirius things it doesntmake much sense harry was relieved when ginny nodded obviously realizing that hermione had a point well we were downstairs talking about this place and about the time we had to clean it out explained ginny harry nodded anxiously at her then i remembered some of the things we found and how not all of it was as you put it junk like what asked harry still not seeing what this had to do with a horcrux like ginny said smiling oddly a locket harry gave her a confused expression a locket kind of like the one you and professor dumbledore were looking for harry scoffed you dontreally believe that the locket we found here was a horcrux do you he asked he didntwant to believe her but panic rose inside of him when he realized that if she was right they might have thrown it out or worse kreacher might ve taken it and now voldemort would have it in his possession again i know it sounds a little strange but yes i do said ginny bringing him out of his thoughts we couldntopen it remember and i dontknow about any of you but i remember thinking that there was something definitely odd about it ron sat down beside hermione on the bed his face twisted into one of deep thought and perplexity but there are millions of lockets out there what makes you think that she right exclaimed hermione ginny grinned triumphantly put two and two together have you she asked hermione nodded excitedly and sat up straighter on the bed you see harry she held a look of defiance on her face when she spoke to him i figured you d have your doubts if i just told you that there was a locket here that might be the one we re looking for you need more than that to back up my theory right harry nodded tell us please what happened when you opened the fake horcrux that you found with dumbledore there was a note inside and whoever wrote it said they stole the real one and were going to destroy it the person said they knew they d die for what they d done but they hoped that voldemort would become mortal again said harry he d read the note over and over since leaving hogwarts while at privet drive he d thought quite a bit about the note although at hogwarts he d sworn up and down to himself that he wouldntbecome inquisitive about the matter wondering what it meant and who had written it and tell us if you can still remember what the signature on that note was ginny said calmly r a b but gin what does oh for merlin sake you dontget it yet barked hermione no harry admitted ron ron shook his head i just as lost as you are mate i dontknow anyone with those initials of course you dontknow him ginny sighed he dead then how d you know him ron asked irritably he like harry didntlike being kept in the dark about things especially since ginny and hermione seemed to be enjoying their confusion so much harry said hermione can you think of anyone whose last name starts with b harry furrowed his brow brown he asked ron snorted hermione rolled her eyes and ginny shook her head um bones they didntgo to hogwarts with us hinted ginny bloody hell quit playing games and just tell us ron demanded a light bulb went off in harry head they were in grimmauld place after all clearly the blacks would have something to do with ginny theory he yelled black exactly cried hermione excitedly but sirius wasnt not sirius you idiot bellowed ginny you two are awfully thick y know she couldntcontain her small smile and broke into an all out grin think of the family tree offered hermione harry tried to picture the tree in his mind all the blacks were dead so there was no process of elimination he could think of no one with the fitting initials though the only other people on the tree that he could remember were tonks bellatrix lestrange and the malfoys regulus ron asked hermione squealed and nodded furiously ginny stared at her brother in slight disbelief before nodding along i though sirius told you he was a death eater though harry went back in time close to two whole years ago to his conversation with sirius yeah he was but sirius said he tried to get out and one of the others killed him ginny smiled at him and raised her eyebrows waiting to hear his opinion you dontthink that you bet your arse i do was her reply so d you think i right regulus black had been killed around the same time harry had been born he was a death eater probably one of the more important ones given that he was a black and therefore knew about many curses and spells and other things that were of interest to voldemort voldemort had given lucius malfoy the diary to hold onto could he have perhaps let regulus in on its importance could regulus have discovered that there were others as well having decided that he was not cut out to be a death eater and knew that he would soon be killed for wanting to leave the ranks had he set out to destroy a horcrux and eliminate some of voldemort soul harry found it hard to believe that there was good left in someone like regulus black someone who had willingly become a death eater sirius went to azkaban for the murders of twelve muggles and peter pettigrew and all the while everyone was convinced he had led voldemort to the potters when he hadntdone anything other than be a best friend to them and try to extract revenge on pettigrew he almost died in azkaban but he broke out to see harry he broke out of a place where it was impossible to feel happy or to love only to smile laugh and love again could people change had pettigrew wanted to change only to realize he was in too deep he was a coward afraid of dying and was most likely forced to go along with whatever voldemort told him to do but harry felt no sympathy for him he was a bastard and harry wished with every fiber of his being that pettigrew suffered the most excruciatingly painful death imaginable how would that be for someone who feared death perhaps regulus was like pettigrew with one major difference he would rather die than live as voldemort servant for another second you well maybe you could be right said harry he tried to sound indifferent though his insides felt as though they were in his throat and his mind was already running with the idea he was so excited that he could ve kissed ginny except ron was there and he would ve beaten harry to a bloody pulp let go he said standing up and running out of the room he ran down the stairs not caring that he almost tripped several times and was relieved to see that the order members hadntleft yet harry called ginny from the stairs she was running after him hermione and ron behind her what re you doing finding that horcrux he answered ron head was spinning he still wasnttotally sure what was going on but he got the general idea if ginny was right and it looked like she was judging by the way hermione was hanging off of her every word that meant they might know where another horcrux was that meant ginny was a bloody genius if she figured that all out in five seconds while it took him and harry almost a bloody half hour just to realize what she was talking about professor mcgonagall harry yelled as they followed him into the kitchen professor what is it potter barked mcgonagall looking rather disconcerted by the way harry came scrambling into the room shouting for her we know where another horcrux is hermione exclaimed coming to stand beside ron panting slightly mcgonagall turned serious as did the other members what do you mean granger we dontknow for sure harry said sternly shooting hermione a glare the note that i gave you earlier the one about r a b we think we know who r a b is who is it harry asked lupin regulus black said harry sirius brother tonks asked incredulously but he was a death eater we know harry said quickly but it all fits he was killed because he went against voldemort and what better way to go against voldemort than by stealing part of his soul and trying to destroy it yes well provided that his middle name begins with an a that works rather nicely kingsley piped up but how can we be sure it was him and can we really trust that if he really did write the note he managed to destroy it when we were cleaning this place up a few summers ago began harry we found a bunch of old black heirlooms and other things one of those things was a locket and even though mrs weasley tried all sorts of spells and other things none of us could open it up that right confirmed mrs weasley i remember that we think regulus died before he could destroy it so he hid it here for safekeeping ginny said confidently is there any way to test the object to be able to determine if it was really a horcrux inquired hermione i would need the object first explained mcgonagall is it lying around here somewhere ron began to get nervous they had thrown that junk out what were the chances that one of the girls decided it was pretty and had saved it from meeting its fate in the rubbish bin er not exactly said ron mum and sirius made us throw a lot of the stuff out i know where it is said harry everyone stared at him eagerly mundungus has it why would he have it bill asked professor dumbledore brought it to my attention one day that he had been stealing things from headquarters explained mcgonagall you believe he took the locket potter yes said harry he must ve ginny agreed i didntfind it anywhere and i ve been searching this entire place for over an hour mcgonagall nodded i was on my way over to hogwarts to speak to albus so i will inform him of our recent discoveries while i am there i suppose i can consult phineas nigellus and see if he happens to know the middle name of his great great grandson i will then pay mundungus fletcher a visit she winked at harry when she said this and ron couldnthelp but grin professor mcgonagall though strict at times wasntthat bad in the mean time she turned to regard mr and mrs weasley keep them here when i return assuming that i ve managed to obtain the locket we shall administer the proper tests and provided they prove that you are correct we can destroy the horcrux excellent said mr weasley i presume it was you miss granger who came to this conclusion asked mcgonagall hermione smiled softly but shook her head mcgonagall looked puzzled actually professor ginny figured it out said harry he smiled knowingly at her i told you she was useful ginny blushed mcgonagall only nodded but ron didntmiss the look in her eyes as she glanced at ginny there was a sense of pride there perhaps even a trace of an apology for not trusting harry decision for doubting ginny capability the four friends waited until they were safely back upstairs close to twenty minutes later before celebrating you re brilliant exclaimed hermione as she hugged ginny ron and harry grinned and slapped each other on the back yeah hermione had better watch her back because you re about to take over her title as miss know it all said ron as he hugged his sister hermione who was hugging harry a little too enthusiastically for ron liking glared at him and rolled his eyes ron didntparticularly like the way harry hugged ginny he wrapped his arms tightly around her middle just as he d done the night they won the quidditch cup right before he kissed her that kiss led to other things i e more snogging which evolved into a relationship which turned into his sister nursing a broken heart one that his best friend gave to her and he refused to let it happen again but when he saw ginny smile and wrap her arms around his neck ron bit his tongue and said nothing perhaps later when they were alone he and harry would have words but not right now he was snapped out of his trance and stopped watching them when a pair of arms wrapped tightly around him and the scent of strawberries hit him he put his arms around hermione and tried not to make it too obvious that he was thoroughly enjoying the physical contact with her when they broke apart far too quickly in ron opinion he noticed that harry and ginny were whispering ron strained to hear what they were saying but hermione cleared her throat and conjured up a chessboard saying that they would be staying at headquarters for awhile and should busy themselves to pass the time i take it that it d seem a bit inappropriate to kiss you right now whispered harry ginny laughed playfully hitting his arm she replied yes unless you want to use sirius room she smiled at him and briefly thought that it might not be such a bad idea harry grinned at her and she mentally prepared an excuse cleaning up the mess she d left on the bedroom floor seemed like a good one for why she and harry would be slipping away i sure he d be glad to know it was being put to good use he joked but there was sadness in his eyes as he spoke about sirius that betrayed him she turned back to her brother who was trying to act nonchalant but failing miserably had he heard them when he didntsay anything to either of them ginny relaxed a bit and settled in to watch as hermione attempted to beat ron at chess something she d never succeeded in doing before this time proved no different as ron smirked at her and said checkmate hermione sighed and challenged him to another game and ron was happy to oblige he would never pass up the chance to best hermione at something even if it wasntsomething extremely important chess was ron area of expertise and there was no denying it nobody in hogwarts had ever beaten him though many of them had given it a shot on more than one occasion i going to go put sirius things back where they belong announced harry standing up and walking away from the game of chess d you want help ginny asked feeling guilty about the inconsiderate way she just marched up to his godfather room and tore through his things at the time she d been far too excited to particularly care if she was being a bit tactless no it alright said harry it ll only take the flick of a wand i ll be right back ginny nodded and watched as harry left the room she yawned and rested her head in her hand as her brother and hermione battled on the chessboard for a short while it actually looked like hermione might scrape out a win but ron quickly realized her strategy and emerged victorious once more as they neared the end of their next game ginny realized that harry still hadntreturned does anyone have any idea what keeping harry she asked ron grunted and shrugged ginny rolled her eyes at her brother he hated to be disturbed during a game of chess it was one of the few things he actually took seriously he probably in the kitchen getting something to eat why dontyou go find him and bring us back some food suggested hermione okay i ll be right back ginny said standing up sure that what they all say ron muttered lightheartedly as one of his pieces smashed hermione knight to bits ginny smiled and left the room she knew harry wasntin the kitchen she climbed a set of stairs and quietly walked down the corridor stopping outside of the room that once belonged to sirius she could see harry sitting on the bed leaning up against the wall harry she whispered walking into the room and making her presence known harry didntlook at her he continued to stare in another direction and ginny guessed that his eyes were fixed on the photos on the wall he hated it here was all harry said ginny nodded softly and sat down beside him on the bed he hated his family and he hated this house look at this place it so dark and dreary it no wonder he ran away when he was sixteen i never knew he did that said ginny quietly her eyes sweeping the room the mess she d made was now gone harry nodded but still didntturn to face her he told me he stayed at my dad house he shifted a bit to get more comfortable that how much he hated it here he literally ran away and started living alone in his own flat when he was just seventeen he explained he hated this place more than any other place in the world maybe even more than azkaban oh harry i sure that azkaban the dementors suck all the happiness out of you yes but that didntaffect him he had no happiness in him anymore dontyou get that gin asked harry he sighed heavily every time i think about lily and james potter i only see them as my parents but look he pointed to the picture of sirius and his parents on the opposite wall they were his best friends and when they were killed it affected him too it wasntjust me harry he was in azkaban for twelve years continued harry ignoring her and all the while he knew he didntdeserve to be there he knew that wormtail had betrayed all of them but nobody else did he had to live with that everyday he had to live with the fact that lupin thought he murdered my parents and that everyone else even me did too it must ve been terrible ginny whispered yeah but we all came around y know lupin knows he was innocent and mostly importantly so do you said ginny at least he died knowing that harry idly put an arm around her and she sank down onto him her head resting on his chest i guess you re right harry said i wish he hadntspent his final months here though and it doesntfeel right to me being here i dontjust mean being in this room i mean the whole house ginny nodded into his chest and said nothing harry hadntvoluntarily opened up like this to her before and she didntwant to speak now and stop him i hate that we re stuck here i want to leave so badly right now i d rather be with the dursleys locked up in my old cupboard than be sitting in this place ginny sighed she didntlike feeling helpless but there was nothing she could do or say that would help harry she couldntbring sirius or even his parents for that matter back from the dead she couldntmake mcgonagall appear so they could get rid of the horcrux and get back to the burrow as soon as possible she couldnteven guarantee that the locket was a horcrux and that only made her feel worse what if she had been wrong and had only gotten everyone hopes up for nothing harry took a deep breath i miss him i know you do replied ginny i do too she sniffed willing herself not to cry she thought of sirius the one who told her jokes and stayed up with her family all night when her father had been attacked she sniffed again cursing herself as harry comforted her she was supposed to be strong for him not the other way around there was a long silence one that ginny estimated had spanned for more than half an hour she decided that they were finished talking and was about to get up when harry said quietly i cantend up like him ginny sat up abruptly and stared at him she had never seen him like this he was so broken she felt tears sting her eyes as harry stared unblinkingly at the picture of the parents he never knew and the godfather he didntget to know well enough and suddenly she knew why they had to keep their relationship a secret at least for the moment in many ways sirius had suffered far more than any of the others had harry had the impending battle with voldemort constantly hanging over his head but he had friends and family constantly around him helping him for twelve years sirius had nothing and no one even once he escaped from the dementors he had no freedom no true happiness he had only remus and harry they were the only things in the world that connected his new life to his past life the life when james potter was his best friend and peter pettigrew was just quiet and seemed a little odd at times he lived for harry and because of that he died for harry gradually throughout his life sirius had lost everything that had ever meant anything at all to him first he lost his family then his best friends then his freedom harry had already lost his family did he think he d lose his friends too did he think he d lose her she wanted to tell him that he wouldntend up like sirius and that she d never leave him but she couldn t she couldntmake that promise not without knowing that it could be broken at any moment she hoped he knew that she d do everything in her power to keep that from happening though he looked at her watery brown eyes met tormented emerald ones she knew and he knew for now that was enough they would talk at the wedding the plans had not been changed but for now ginny could almost live with not being with harry because in the end it was about harry it always was for her at least and she couldn t for the life of her see a problem with that a tear ran down her cheek and he brushed it away with his thumb unsuccessfully trying to smile she sniffed and harry pulled her to him once more tightening his grip on her slightly she buried her face in his chest and cried she cried for sirius for harry for dumbledore for everyone who would suffer because of voldemort and for everyone who already had she wished he would cry she knew he needed to but he didn t he just stayed there stroking her hair and staring at the pictures until hermione found them later and announced that professor mcgonagall was back something going on with them ron told hermione as they set up for another round of chess what do you mean asked hermione although she knew immediately what he meant oh come off it of course you ve noticed it you arentthe smartest witch in our year for nothing insisted ron they ve been gone for an hour now well yes but i dontthink anything is going on she lied she didntparticularly enjoy lying to ron but she had to in this instance the truth was that something was going on between harry and ginny but she had been put in an awkward position and was being forced to cover for them not only for them but herself too if ron found out that she d known and hadntsaid anything she d be in for quite the row not that she minded the majority of their conversations resorted to screaming and insulting each other but it would be different if they had a real reason to fight hermione had never before given one of her friends a reason not to trust her but she would definitely deserve it if ron found out and she lost his trust maybe we should go find them he suggested they cantbe in the kitchen getting food it wouldnthave taken them this long this is a big place ron she said perhaps harry wanted to take a tour it his house now after all ron stood up i going to find them are you coming i suppose she said wearily rising to her feet and following him out of the room where should we start he asked probably sirius bedroom answered hermione she didntthink they d walk in on them shagging not just because four members of her immediate family were in the house but also because she and ginny had had several talks about things like that and both had always thought waiting until marriage was appropriate but she feared that they d be in a heated snog when she and ron found them they climbed the stairs her anxiety growing with each step until they were right outside of the bedroom she could hear them talking and took it as a good sign at least he died knowing that she heard ginny say she and ron exchanged glances hermione of concern and ron of confusion she mouthed sirius and a look of recognition dawned on his face i guess you re right i wish he hadntspent his final months here though and it doesntfeel right to me being here harry said quietly hermione suddenly felt very uncomfortable with herself as she and ron stood outside the room out of sight listening to their conversation they didntdare get too close to the door in case they were discovered i dontjust mean being in this room i mean the whole house i hate that we re stuck here i want to leave so badly right now i d rather be with the dursleys locked up in my old cupboard than be sitting in this place hermione hung her head and ron sighed i miss him harry admitted hermione who had attempted numerous times to get harry to talk about sirius was shocked at how easily he and ginny were talking about him she looked at ron to see if he realized the importance of there conversation but he looked more relieved that anything else she wasnteven sure he was still listening to the conversation he seemed convinced that everything was okay and they turned to leave i know you do i do too when ginny sniffed she saw ron tense up and they both stopped walking was ginny crying they heard another sniff and she was positive it came from ginny ron looked uncomfortable again he turned and silently walked back to the room poking his head in when he didntget caught hermione followed and also peered into the room harry was sideways on the bed leaning up against the wall ginny was resting her head against his chest and his arm was casually but comfortingly draped around her she didntmiss the small if slightly worried smile that crept across ron face as they tiptoed away from the doorway and went down a set of stairs back to their game of chess this is boring hermione groaned when ron beat her again only because you re losing teased ron perhaps you re just not that interesting did you ever think of that i very interesting you know you like my company he said she wanted to wipe that stupid smirk off his face it would ve been a lot easier if she hadntbeen smiling too i admit nothing she said stubbornly she stretched and got up from the chair she d been sitting in i so bored well you read a book or something i didntbring one if i had known we d be here for so long i obviously would have i not stupid you know ron grinned are you sure about that excuse me she narrowed her eyes and rested her hands on her hips you d better take that back she said in a dangerous tone no he stood up bringing himself to his full height forcing hermione to tilt her head up almost uncomfortably to look at him there a whole library around here somewhere or have you forgotten oh she said quietly right yes i can just read one of those she took a few steps closer making her way to the door but ron was still in her path he didntmove right he agreed she unconsciously licked her lips he brushed a strand of hair out of her face and she felt a shiver go down her spine his hand rested on her cheek and after an eternity of staring at each other they began to lean in hermione eyes fluttered shut and her breathing hitched as they got closer someone cleared their throat from behind ron they jumped back from one another and hermione looked angrily towards the door ready to hex whoever had cleared their throat and disturbed them oh i sorry lupin apologized quickly looking thoroughly uncomfortable i can come back if no no professor we were just um playing chess mumbled hermione gesturing toward the chessboard she could be a convincing liar when she wanted to be but the deep blush on her cheeks obviously betrayed her this time yes of course you were lupin said slyly he held a rather amused look on his face as he nodded pretending to believe the obvious lie molly making lunch she sent me up here to see if you wanted some yes i starving ron said dramatically yes please said hermione where are harry and ginny do they want anything questioned lupin have mum to make some extra for them and if they donteat it i will answered ron hermione rolled her eyes he could eat anything and not gain a single pound she hated him for it okay i going now said lupin have fun with your chess game shut up said ron though he was smiling and tell mum to hurry up with that food ron you have no manners whatsoever do you know that bugger off hermione you arentmy mother well arentyou a quick one although i fairly certain your mother has at least tried to teach you a thing or two about politeness okay fine i ll be polite please get off my back and leave me alone thank you hermione scowled honestly lupin still stood in the doorway watching the two as if they were a show put on for his entertainment he snapped out of it and disappeared from view heading back down to the kitchen where the rest of the adults were ron coughed and looked away from her running a hand through his hair he looked about as embarrassed as she felt she hoped it was because of lupin walking in on them and not because of what almost happened i think i going to go get that book now he moved and she left the room rushing upstairs to the library and grabbing a book at random it didntmatter what the subject was ron had almost kissed her her mind wouldntlet her focus on a silly old book now anyway she made her way back to where she d left ron and collapsed into a comfy chair she let her eyes skim over the words still not taking anything in she was vaguely away that the book was entitled dark arts and even darker wizards but she expected nothing else in the house of black what taking mcgonagall so long complained ron as hermione turned to chapter eight grindelwald in her book they d already had lunch not bothering to get harry and ginny and played a few more games of chess i mean what so difficult about apparating to hogwarts having a quick word with dumbledore apparating to wherever mundungus is getting the locket and apparating back here how long could that possibly take hermione put her book down and sighed i expect it would take a very long time considering you cannot apparate in or out of the hogwarts grounds honestly how many times must i tell you that one day i going to force you to read hogwarts a history no you re not i d sooner die than read that book he exaggerated i dontknow what sadder the fact that you d willingly give your life before you would read a book or the fact that i somewhat believe you when you say that ron shrugged whatever besides i dontneed to read it you talk about it so bloody much that i already know half of it off by heart i sure apparently not considering you stilldontremember something as simple as the apparition restrictions she said tiredly if you d just pay even an ounce of attention to sorry to interrupt again said lupin but minerva is back both hermione and ron jumped up and bolted out of the room hermione remembered harry and ginny and went to tell them that mcgonagall was back when they all gathered in the kitchen professor mcgonagall was smiling something hermione took as a good sign well ron asked impatiently when they all entered the kitchen hermione rolled her eyes at his lack of good manners hello sit down she said the four sat i spoke with albus and he seemed to agree with your theory about regulus and the locket after my talk with him i set out to find mundungus after much persuasion he confessed that he had stolen the locket and he handed it over she reached into her robes and pulled out an old locket it looked as influenced by dark magic as anything hermione had ever seen before but perhaps that was just because she felt sure it contained a seventh of voldemort soul i didnttell him its true purpose of course i let him think i simply wanted it for my own purposes how did you get him to voluntarily give it to you questioned harry i dontexpect he was very willing to part ways with anything he d stolen from sirius mcgonagall flashed a playful smile let just say i know a good hex or two and mundungus didntseem too keen on being on the receiving end of one i would ve loved to have seen that commented ron yes well now it is time to run the appropriate tests so we can be certain this is a horcrux and not just an ordinary locket mcgonagall said pulling out her wand everyone gathered around to watch albus let me in on a handy spell during our visit if this truly is a horcrux we ll know how asked tonks trust me we ll be able to tell mcgonagall muttered a spell that hermione had never heard before and nothing happened her chest clenched and her heart sank they were wrong it wasnta horcrux all that excitement for nothing it seemed she couldntunderstand it everything seemed to fit the initials matched up the actual object was in the house where regulus had lived they should ve been right why didntanything happen as if on cue the locket began to glow a deep purple ginny gasped and ron exclaimed bloody hell mcgonagall smiled and waved her wand again the light died out i think we have our answer she concluded what now asked mrs weasley how do we destroy it she looked expectantly at harry who shrugged i will take care of it mcgonagall said she cleared her throat and began speaking in what sounded like another language it reminded hermione of the time she had heard harry speaking parseltongue and couldntcomprehend a word he had said she continued repeating the same few sentences over and over flicking and swishing her wand in one continuous motion hermione was almost positive she was speaking some type of italian and she scolded herself for not knowing enough of the language to understand what mcgonagall was saying she finally concluded the spell with a different sentence which appeared to be in yet another language ron later swore he heard her say something about sandwiches during her incantation and the horcrux broke off into small pieces and crumbled to dust a rather frightening puff of green smoke rose out of the locket and as it began to take shape it vanished into the air three down growled moody three to go and then we get voldemort harry said in a menacing determined tone special thanks to mugglenet where i first read about the theory on rab reviews are always appreciated
