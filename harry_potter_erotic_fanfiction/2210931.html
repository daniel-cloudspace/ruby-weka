 chapter10 the death of lucius malfoy draco had received the letter in mid afternoon on thursday but it was hours before he would open it after all he knew what it was and he had been ready for it or so he thought lucius malfoy was one of those people you could tell werentgoing to live very long and it was no surprise to draco that when he opened the tan envelope that lucius had been found dead the night before he did not let out one squeak did not let one emotion escape him though they were there bubbling just below the surface he sat in his dorm thursday night reading and re reading every line of the letter as if it were a magazine or a book he felt so detached it was odd even for him draconis aquilus malfoy the ministry regrets to inform you that your father was found dead in the early hours of wednesday morning the cause of death is unknown as of yet and we offer our greatest condolences his service if you choose to attend will be on september nineteenth at four o clock at the malfoy mansion our best wishes to you in your education and we hope that your father generous and caring nature will live on through you cornelius fudge minister of magic fudge last words made draco blood boil his father had not been generous he had been clever in bribing the right officials fudge included into letting him keep his position it made draco ill to think of how much of their treasury had been wasted on bribery and when draco took charge of the malfoy manor affairs that would be the first thing to change they would do something productive with the money draco would attain as a death eater if the dark lord reign lasted to that point anyway even without that money the malfoy were sitting on a pile of gold as high as gringotts itself will you be attending his service mr malfoy snape had asked i could sign you up while you re at your first lesson but draco had only smiled while shaking his head why would i waste one more minute away from school than i have to my father said himself that in times of hardship one must concentrate on the thing that will get them by he said it would be foolish to assume myself above education even in the most appropriate circumstances draco said coldly if he would have wanted me there he would have died during the summer or over holiday he didn t i not leaving they ll bury him whether or not i am present very well i hope that this will not be one of those things you regret as an adult snape had replied just as lacking in emotion i will get a copy of the will to you so you may read over it yourself and like that their conversation was over it was only after he had lain down to sleep that the emotion returned and it was like nothing he had ever felt before his father the man he had known his whole life who had always been there over summer over holiday was gone he was gone forever just like that most of all draco regretted their last conversation he was leaving draco had watched him pack his bags but it was so unfair lucius had promised that their summer would go uninterrupted by the whims and crazy impulses of lord voldemort draco hated the look on his mother face when lucius left on his missions for voldemort and there was so little draco could do to make it stop to make her pain subside all he could do was watch her fear the night his father left he remembered his mother coming into his room in the middle of the night her black hair had been pulled back into a long elegant ponytail and she wore her dark green and silver nightdress that he had grown used to after he had been accepted as a slytherin she had had this look on her face a look that said everything was so wrong that she didntknow how to fix it all it was then that draco began to hate his father loathing him for everything he was and even more for what he wasn t you know it not us narcissa had begun your father had to go he has things he needs to take care of that are more important than you or i her voice came alive in draco head and he tried to block the memory has lucius always hated to be here draco heard himself ask has voldemort always been more important shush do not say that name she had reprimanded quietly as she sat down at the end of his bed she thought for a moment before answering no i suppose he hasntalways had the same focuses but that was before you know who did he ever love me draco choked on his pillow as he relived every second slowly and painfully of course he did he still does you re his only son and that means more to him than you will ever know she paused looking at him through bruised eyelids he hit you draco said shortly cringing away from the ugly scar on her beautiful face he hit you again why does he do it why does he hit you again and again and again draco had stood and was pacing he was so mad he thought that he should have shattered i shouldnthave talked back it was my fault i know how he feels about that sort of thing she excused and draco yelled at her to be quiet dontyou talk to me that way draconis malfoy i will not be mistreated by my own son father does it why canti what is so different about it mum is it because he bigger than you he ranted no it because my greatest ambition as a mother was to free you of the expectation to be like your father and in that at least i have succeeded or i should hope so she admonished while standing she walked to the door and turned back her hand on the frame i do not think your father will be returning from this mission as i ve always told you be prepared and do not let his choices dictate yours she finished with a short smile oh yes i will be gone for a while good luck at school jessike will help you ready yourself be a good prefect and that was the last he had spoken with her except for short correspondences between weeks just meaningless letters inquiring about school and his health he wouldntsay he answered dishonestly he just left out important details he thought she didntdeserve to know considering draco admitted he shouldntbe mad at her but now that lucius was gone who was there to hate what was there to loathe to make him so angry he could kill who was left but voldemort the ax that split his family apart long before he could remember what happiness was like draco sat up in his bed and squinted his eyes reaching under his bed he grabbed his small but substantial stash of alcohol why no drink everything away why should draco malfoy be unhappy if he didnthave to why grieve for a father that wasntworth a penny of the money he had to his name draco stood quietly and grabbed his pants from the end of his four poster pulling them up just under his hips draco paused to yawn he buttoned his jeans blindly while grabbing his wand from his bedside table and putting it in his back pocket draco pulled the first bottle from the six pack and opened it with a flick of his fingers tipping the bottle back the bitter liquid met his tongue with a satisfying fizz that burned his throat he knew that he shouldntbe drinking in here but at the moment common sense wasntthe only thing he was lacking finishing off the first bottle draco wiped his mouth vexatiously while grabbing another shirtless and slightly disoriented draco walked down the dormitory steps six pack in one arm and a fresh beer in the other by the time he reached the prefect common room he had drunk his was through three beers and started on another though his vision was becoming a bit blurred and his equilibrium was a bit off balance he felt as though his thinking was still quite clear for someone his age considering how much alcohol he had already consumed the fire in the grate was burning quite strongly emitting a deep radiating heat that made him slightly drowsy as he stumbled forward into the dim room looking around he noticed the lavished richness which he had been missing out on in the slytherin dormitories there were four chairs and three couches placed strategically around the room there was one blue chair and couch one red chair and couch two green chairs and one yellow couch it was then that draco realized how truly large the prefectorial commons were and there were still the two dorms per house that they were offered along with the badge and responsibility draco staggered towards the green chair and cursed the fact that slytherins had to be such loners that was why there was no green couch no slytherin could stand being any closer to another than they had to whereas the hufflepuffs were the exact opposite they had only a couch for their prefects he sat in the soft chair and leaned his head back into the cushion he felt unnervingly calm as if his mind was readying for war setting the box by the chair he opened his fifth beer and slowly began to down it closing his eyes to let the feeling of complete calm that he loved overwhelm him well well well why am i not surprised the great draco malfoy turning our respectable commons into a personal lounge said a very annoying and unwelcome voice from the doorway and draco drowsily lifted one of his eyelids squinting through the darkness of the room to see a familiar mudblood why dontyou just leave go on he said motioning for her to exit through the in which she had come from i not leaving this is my commons just as much as it is yours she snapped while stepping even further into the room he could see the look of disgust on her face as she surveyed his unkempt appearance it no doubt bothered her that he was not wearing a shirt and this thought made draco smile slightly you know as difficult as it may seem to be to grasp in your current state malfoy your problems whatever they may be will still be here when you sober up draco guffawed then took a swig of his drink i draco fricken malfoy for christ sake i donthave problems i have everything he slurred loudly but softly while he sat up that rich i dontnormally see men who have problems drink like this she said smartly and what men do you know granger he asked spitefully potter weaselby he gave a short laugh and took another drink i bet they haventeven gotten laid yet yes that what makes a man granger said mockingly and draco stood angrily while brandishing his half empty bottle at her get the fuck out he whispered but the tone behind the words stung he could tell by the way that she recoiled my pleasure i didntwant to witness your disgusting display of lack of impulse control in the first place draco was suddenly so angry and he had no idea what had triggered it but then again it was granger know it all i always have an answer hello i have my hand raised granger fuck you granger what do you know about anything he half shouted he held the bottle to his lips and finished off the contents in one swallow nothing malfoy nothing at all draco reached woefully for the last bottle and opened it it funny i actually felt as though i owed you something for finding my necklace but you know what you can go to hell i done trying to be civil with you malfoy granger turned to leave but draco felt the need for company whether it was unpleasant or not no wait i d rather not she said crudely no honestly it me who forgotten to be civil come and have a drink or two he offered innocently as if she could not decline his offer you cantbe serious granger scoffed alcohol is a vile substance that renders even the most admirable men into mindless and sex driven jerks though i d be highly surprised if you werentthere before you started to binge and do you happen to have any more completely useless words of wisdom to share i growing bored listening to you drone on you re beginning to sound like binns you know that he paused he was saying everything as it came to him and for once it he got to be brutally and offhandedly honest you really think you know everything dontyou i never claimed to be any smarter than i was just because you are intimidated to think that a muggle born may know just as much maybe even more than you you who has been raised and groomed to be perfect draco clenched his fist how dare she even assume what he was being groomed for if only she knew draco thought wickedly it would wipe that arrogant know it all smile off her face in an instant if you re so smart why didntyou do yourself and the wizarding world a favor and do yourself in you re never going to be accepted never he shouted there will always be wizards like me to remind you of what you are unworthy of the name of magic he would make sure she knew exactly what she was a black mark on the world of magic a blemish on the face of the hogwarts enrollment lists tears filled her eyes as he glared maliciously at her and she clenched her small fists at her sides as if she was ready to fight him go on if you re going to think it so loud go ahead and hit me i ll have your ass on the floor before you even swing he threatened drunkenly you re disgusting though she said the words only loud enough for him to hear it was as if she had yelled at him at the top of her lungs called him every foul and despicable name there was and then she turned around as if she was just going to leave following after granger blindly draco stumbled over the coffee table that he suddenly noticed was placed in front of his chair and fell he pulled himself up groggily staggering hurriedly after her as she left the commons and he called after her i not done talking to you mudblood well that funny i done listening granger said thoughtfully as she nearly double her pace just to get away from him you know what draco asked and she whipped around what you re such a bitch granger he vociferated his expression one of complete seriousness how mature ten points from slytherin for you being such a filthy little git she said while placing her hands on her hips and glaring across the hall at him yeah draco asked without hesitation twenty points from gryffindor for you being an insufferable know it all that is incapable of keeping her filthy trap shut he yelled oh fifty points from slytherin for you even existing malfoy she shouted back matching not only his tone but his sincerity as well one hundred points from gryffindor for well just because granger jaw dropped and draco was panting silence filled the hallway and it seemed as if draco words were echoing repeating again and again draco just stood there very satisfied with himself at the moment it seemed as if granger was just about to retort but she didntget the chance for someone was walking down the hall towards them he saw granger tense as mcgonagal came near enough to distinguish and he could have laughed he was feeling highly untouchable at the moment which could have been due to his complete inebriation miss granger mr malfoy what on earth are you two doing up and about in the castle at this time of night she exclaimed in disbelief what did i tell you two she asked her mouth twitching slightly explanations and you better make it good she added the option sternly as if she had not originally planned on hearing their reasons i was going to go to bed in the prefect commons and i saw malfoy waiting in there and so i asked him if he wanted to make a quick round of the school just to be safe granger said quickly while stumbling over her words as she tried to say them as quickly as she could yes professor you know how much of a coward granger is so she begged me to go along he slurred over dramatically and the mudblood glared turning back to mcgonagal that right but when i saw that malfoy jumped every time there was an odd sound i immediately regretted it she retorted calmly you wish draco snapped no i wish that you would but she didntget to finish her sentence enough from both of you mcgonagal intervened miss granger a word please yes professor the mudblood asked a familiar dread filling her voice mcgonagal pulled her over to the corner but draco could still hear every word they said as clear as if they were standing right next to him still the hallways were charmed so as not to echo why arentyou sleeping in the gryffindor dorms mcgonagal asked her voice not lacking in concern you know why they all hate me and i tired of them acting like i invisible like they can say whatever they want when they think i canthear them i see mcgonagal said slowly go on to bed and do not let me catch you out of bed in the middle of the night again mcgonagal looked to draco then at granger then eerily slowly back to draco what happened to mr malfoy shirt she asked and both him and granger froze it was too hot in the commons and i didnthave time to grab one he said noxiously while yawning and stretching like a cat and he saw the mudblood roll her eyes from now on if you are to make rounds you will both be fully attired robes and all mcgonagal admonished if not you will face great consequences now goodnight miss granger mr malfoy go straight to sleep i will not tolerate this sort of mischief she said with sickening conviction you may be prefects but prefects are to use their power to reinforce the rules not to break them mcgonagal turned and walked back down the hall draco saw the mudblood let out a sigh of relief similar to the one he had just released dontyou ever defend me again you mudblood he spat contemptuously i d rather get expelled and packed off to azkaban than be defended by you he said coldly as they walked back to the commons it wasntfor you believe me it was for me she replied just as coldly it would have been suspicious if we had just stood there with no answers and i am not ready to be expelled not after five years of perfect grades and hard work i sure that is the first thing you thought of eh draco snarled viciously i surprised it wasntpotter or weasley oh what ever would they do without me there to stick my filthy nose in their business and boss them around he mocked insolently while feigning distress you re you incorrigible granger i incorrigible hermione asked in utter dismay you re the one that still holds onto cruel eighteenth century practices and the belief that all witches and wizards of mixed blood are evil she said with a wicked laugh as she crossed her fingers in the shape of a cross in front of her and hissed i never said evil he replied his lip curling into a sneer of its own accord less than me yes unworthy definitely filthy disgusting grimy little but he was interrupted by granger annoying yet narrowly soothing voice we re here granger said shortly and draco leaned against the wall a half cocked smile still on his face good thing too i was beginning to run out of vulgar adjectives to apply to your kind he said wistfully whilst pointing in her direction i not surprised considering your lack of intelligence and your indisposed state of mind but i suppose that is none of my business and i could honestly care less she added with a spiteful smirk of her very own hephalump she said arrogantly but nothing happened and her shoulders slumped slightly god damn it hephalump she shouted while hitting the stone with an open palm he could tell she just wanted to get as far away from him as possible in a short period of time that is the password right she asked turning desperately to draco who made sure he had that same know it all smirk on his face had you been at the meeting this morning he began jokily you would have received the information on the prefectorial quarters granger i dunno if it my place to share with you the confidential information that this little paper he began to dig around in his robes has to offer he finished while waving it mischievously just out of reach i didntget one you prat i was with mcgonagal this morning granger said angrily while crossing her arms over her chest and glaring at him loathingly so you say he began with as a sly idea came to him suddenly say please or no passwords draco said with a half serious grin on his face please is all i ask he whispered quietly almost tenderly and granger bent to his will please just give me the fucking password that a girl didntknow if you had it in you he said while shoving it into her outstretched hand i ve got it memorized the password changes every thursday night at midnight which is why you got in earlier dont lose it he warned and she guffawed as if his worries were completely unfounded gryffindors are the ones that seem to have a tendency to lose lists of passwords when crazed fugitives are running about the place gandalf ariel granger asked interrupting his comically perceptive thoughts who came up with these she asked in amusement as she skimmed through the list laughing at the ridiculous passwords all the prefects had thought of that morning without her they sound absolutely ridiculous had you been there you would have had a say in what the passwords were but because they werentinterested in eternum mortalis i suppose we should be gracious to embrace an eccentric wizard from a fantasy trilogy and a disney character straight from the pages of virgins international he said reproval and disgust echoing in his voice he was insulted at the so obviously hufflepuff choices right granger said and he could tell she had only been half listening which pissed him off he more than deserved her attentions gandalf the tapestry with the hogwarts crest on it blew aside revealing a hole in the wall just big enough for humans to pass through but as soon as they entered it became solid stone again except for a small handle well i guess it off to bed for the little mudblood draco simpered coolly suits me just as well then g night but she had already walked into her quarters and slammed the door loudly the sign on the door falling to the ground with a thud dontneed a filthy mudblood to ruin my night he said quietly to himself she ll just put a damper on the whole celebratory evening g bye dad he whispered while mock saluting the air farewell you served your purpose well you wretched loathsome beast and not before long he had another six pack at his side and one by one he tipped them back drowning himself in the pleasures each beer allotted one like him but twenty minutes later he was feeling quite differently about the whole thing he sat on his hands and knees retching all over the blue red and green 3000 thread count rug and to make matters invariably worse himself he knew he was loud but he didntreally care not that he could help it he wasntabout to be courteous when it felt as though his insides were being forced into his throat and out his mouth granger would have to bear the inconvenience of listening to him wretch his pretty little slytherin guts out all over their floor but after a few minutes he discovered that she wouldntbear it silently can you knock that off she shouted from her dormitory i would if i could you filthy little but he was interrupted by another wave of sour acrid vomit five minutes later he heard her growl loudly and stomp to the door flinging it open with a flourish she stepped into the faint glow of the fireplace light and glowered down at him importantly i have lessons to attend tomorrow malfoy and the last thing that i need is to spend the whole night listening to you vomit all that alcohol up onto our floor she shouted granger brandished her wand professionally and said the incantation scourgefy the vomit disappeared and she looked down at him as if he was dirt beneath her pink frilly slippers get up she said sternly while grabbing him by the arm he was too weak to resist so he just tried to help as much as he could come on just to the fricken chair malfoy you can do it she encouraged without any zeal whatsoever there now sit granger finished forcefully she rubbed her hands together and looked at him no looked through him with her serious brown eyes now first things first you need to sober up she took the bottle from his hand and he made a failing attempt to maul her mine he shouted loudly and she cringed only for a second before letting him have it i am trying to help you you pathetic little rich boy now sit down and behave yourself he suddenly felt like a chastised young boy at church did she just call me a pathetic little rich boy he realized too late he had said it out loud and granger complied by adding a clever comment of her own yes i did because you are just that a spoiled little rich brat i sure you re father is the one who bought you these and smuggled them onto hogwarts grounds he is just as much to blame donttalk about him draco murmured solemnly but granger went on as if she hadntheard him you need to accept that daddy not always going to be here i mean if dumbledore but her words faded as her first statement hit home his father wasnt there anymore he wasntanywhere granger can i ask you something he asked in an almost indiscernible slur as he looked up at her sadly through deliriously glazed eyes she gave a curt nod and said what should i feel sad he gone what are you talking about malfoy who gone she inquired interestedly while changing all his beer into bottled water my father he dead i know no i feel obligated to hurt to be said that he gone he was my father for christ sake he stated bitterly but you want to know the truth granger he asked not caring if she did or not i donteven miss him not even a little i dont feel sad that he gone i feel suddenly free he knew he was rambling but granger seemed very intent on what she was doing he doubted she was even listening and despite that he didnteven know if he was saying anything he used to hold such a tight leash around my neck when i was a first year but i think i grew stronger from then he said while rubbing his neck nervously i dontreally understand how i feel about him being you know dead and all but i know it not normal his voice became raspy and faded as he tried to keep from drowsing well granger said rising from the floor after cleaning up all of his sick up off the carpet your father was not a normal man by any standards was he draco shook his head he always seemed so out of reach inhuman you know he asked and she smirked he had the feeling she knew exactly what he meant and it wasntat all unrelated to him i dontthink i loved him hermione i dontthink we cared about each other enough to really pay any attention to petty attachments weaknesses he stuttered inarticulately i feel like there this hole where my emotion should be like someone run me through you never really showed much of a knack for being very emotionally coordinated she said unmoved by his openness what in this merlin name makes you think you can start now i have emotions draco began rather loudly just because i dontparade them around like you bloody gryffindors doesntmake them any less existent he paused as if to think weakness this is just a bout of weakness he excused mildly enthused dunno why i talking to you not like you listen he snapped i am listening and what you re saying doesntmake a lot of sense granger lectured quietly you need rest you know that stop whining and go to bed draco she said while turning quite frankly i dontknow why you told me all this you know it will end up ammunition for our war i had to say it to someone even someone like you he said spitefully and she turned back to face him and who exactly am i she asked while crossing her arms over her chest defensively a bloody gryffindor he said and she nodded as his vision finally blurred and he was lulled to sleep by her eccentric ranting draco dreamt of very odd things it was granger except she was in a dress a really short dress a dress he could imagine on a prostitute body granger wasnta prostitute not in front of everyone else anyway please god tell me i am not having sexual fantasies about granger draco mentally groaned wake up just wake up this is what he got for getting drunk and having granger be the last thing he saw before falling asleep but granger wasnttaking off her clothes she just stood there staring at him slowly fading out of focus until she was but a white blur in the center of a dark as black room then everything fell away and was replaced by a jungle draco ran forward trying to push his was through the thickest of the underbrush but not before long he was caught and unable to move a single limb it felt like the vines were curling around him twisting constricting to the point where he found himself unable to breathe he had to move on he had to get away there was something in forest he needed something that was everything to him he felt a sickening lurch in his stomach when he realized he couldntremember what it was but that feeling was soon replaced by an even greater fear death it was coming over him like water rushing over a waterfall but it seemed as if time was being extended but he could not get over the feeling that it was not for his benefit alone as his dream self became disoriented from lack of oxygen memories began flashing before his eyes a first birthday his fist broom magic pre school his first trip to hogwarts his last his wedding day his last birthday and his death he hadnteven witnessed any of the last memories but they were as clear as if he had been the one seeing it all himself even though it was impossible dontdie draco whispered a soft voice somewhere beyond his vision everything was growing dimmer yet lighter at the same time find me i need you dontdie draco the voice was getting further and further away the longer he sat there giving into death he felt a particularly vicious vine wrap around his neck and he conceded sadly that this was the end of draco malfoy dontdie draco came the voice again and suddenly draco vision came back with an all new tuned sharpness no he cried out in a short gurgle he ripped at the vine around his neck and pulled it roughly away from his flesh then began tearing madly at the other ones let me go but as he fought more fiercely they too attacked harder and quicker than before but in the end draco escaped gouged and scratched with a broken arm and wandered through the silent underbrush utterly alone he listened and he listened for the voice to lead the way he needed to find the voice he needed to or he would die tripping over a hidden stump draco fell to his knees and cried out as a branch tore the tender flesh of his left inner forearm looking down he could have died from shock beneath a fresh bloody gash was a black tattoo one that draco had never expected to see on his own arm it was a morbid skull with a snake winding it way through the vacated eye sockets and the snake head came out of the skulls mouth its tongue sticking out he reached into the pocket of his robe and tore out the lining placing it quickly over the wound he tore his robe sleeve and tied the frayed strip of cloth tightly around his arm to prevent the wound from bleeding out afterwards he stood and continued on it was grown dark again so dark that visibility was reduced to three feet in the most eventually draco reached in his other pocket to grab his wand but what he pulled out was nothing like wood it was cold steel encrusted with jewels it was the malfoy dagger he had seen it in their family treasury chambers deep below the ground level floor of the malfoy manor what it was doing in his pocket was anybody guess but that was not his greatest nor most pressing worry draco could feel something drawing nearer to him every second he wasted it was still dead silent but he could hear the soft scratching sound of robes on underbrush so near that he shivered suddenly there was a break in the darkness and the full moon shone through the clouds above the dank forest draco looked up and felt a stirring within it was too late he could not react with the dagger before he was bowled over and crushed by the strong sinewy body of a werewolf draco heard one loud scream of a woman before he was most likely torn apart limb by limb but he didntget that far before he was jolted awake by a soft touch on his shoulder chapter 11 a vandal poet words of wisdom hermione could have killed him get up you bloody moron she shouted as she tapped on his shoulder draco jolted awake and came to in a flash what is it granger he asked groggily like you dontknow she yelled why dontyou tell me what you did after i went to my dorm last night i can tell you this draco you are more creative than i gave you credit for she spat sarcastically as she motioned for draco to follow her she pulled aside the tapestry in front of the commons exit and large dark words met his eyes your handiwork mr malfoy your drunken filthy handiwork that not mine draco said i was asleep i passed out while you were bitching my ear off about respect he said and she tried to read his expression but as always it was indecipherable a mudblood and a snake a curse with two tongues the dragon is out of his cage and he looking for blood patience is a virtue or so we were once taught to believe according to him only clean blood is clean pure blood or mixed a witch is a witch if we were taught wrong make haste to the wench she paused only to catch her breath before she read the next verse aloud biting the hand that feeds you will make you no friends using the dragon is but a means to an end looks like your writing to me mudblood draco said coolly and hermione laughed mirthlessly funny i went straight to bed after i was done bitching your ears off she retorted calmly while crossing her arms over her pink pajamas how do i know that i was passed out how do i know that you were passed out bugger off hermione this is such a stupid argument i know it wasntme and you know it wasntyou now can we please move on hermione was silent for a moment and then realization registered on draco face i meant mudblood he corrected quietly no but you said hermione that set aside you and i both know i am not that poetic i may be dashingly handsome but there hardly anything behind the dynastic face hermione finished kindly for him and he shrugged the insult off like one would swat casually at a mosquito your words not mine now am i mistaken or do we have classes to attend draco asked and hermione was taken aback by his whole attitude it was as if he had been hit on the head and had taken on a new unrecognizably civil personification of draco malfoy yes we do but i am surprised that you would be so enthused after such a night of drinking and vomiting to attend breakfast let alone classes i thought you d be groaning and whining your way to the hospital wing her face was dismissive but her voice sounded sincerely confused and she could tell he liked that knowledge constant vigilance granger did impostor moody teach you nothing at all he asked almost flamboyantly as he pulled his wand out from in between the cushions of the chair and pointed it at the offending wall scourgefy the writing disappeared in a flash and he pulled the tapestry back into place tucking his wand safely into his pocket i for one did not like taking on the physical appearance of a ferret i learned rather quickly you see he grabbed the rest of his stuff from the table and walked towards the door good day granger have a mudblood of a time donttake it too literally although i sure you cant help it he opened the door to the commons and walked out whistling a show tune hermione recognized from the musical moulin rouge what a prat hermione said half a smile on her face while shaking her head slowly it was going to be an interesting day she silently considered walking down the gryffindor hallway she entered her dormitory and looked around everything was red and gold except for the bookshelf the coffee table next to her private lounge and her desk above her headboard hung the gryffindor crest and beside that was the hogwarts crest the room itself was not very large but it was comfortable even more so than the regular dormitories they were assigned at the start of every school year there was a small grate on the wall that was almost always lit and hermione favorite part by far was the collection of books that filled the bookshelf it seemed as if all of the material had been chosen specifically to be compatible with her favorite subjects as well as the ones she needed the most help with walking to her dresser she opened the top drawer where she could always find her cleanly pressed hogwarts uniform as well as some other clothing for weekends or her extra volunteer work at hagrid hut hermione pulled out her skirt white blouse red and gold striped tie and vest as well as her white knee socks neatly folding them she placed them on her bed and walked to the bathroom that was regretfully linked with the slytherin one after undressing hermione stepped cautiously into the shower and turned on the tap when she finished washing she stepped out onto the cold marble floor and grabbed her red towel from the rack on the shower door upon wrapping it securely around herself hermione walked out of the bathroom and into her room where she dried and slowly dressed by now it had become an every morning ritual that could not be interrupted after she brushed her teeth and did whatever she was going to do with her hair she went to her desk where all of her assignments and course books were stacked in neatly organized piles she placed her homework in their respectable folders and put everything including her wand in her book bag which was bewitched to hold up to three hundred books but only weigh as much as three putting her regular cloak on she threw her book bag over her shoulder and trekked down to the great hall for a quick breakfast followed by classes gryffindors had charms first care of magical creatures and then double divination which hermione had opted to replace with arithmancy nice old palpable arithmancy reaching the great hall didnttake very long and once she entered the large room she made straight for the gryffindor table hoping that her closest circle of friends had come to their senses and realized she was no more of a traitor than mcgonagall herself as she neared ginny approached her hey hermione she said uncomfortably while looking at her shoes they re still mad arentthey ginny nodded it been a whole week and they should know by now that it wasntmy fault they do they re both too stubborn to do anything about it yet i give it another day or too the young girl smiled and hermione nodded how are things in the rumor department hermione asked quietly and ginny motioned for hermione to sit down not so good most of the girls you know girls like parvati still think you and malfoy were having a good snog and you let it slip but some of the other more mature girls are coming to their senses i mean it you why would you rat out gryffindor to one of the people who you despise as much as they despise you hermione shrugged she wouldnttell ginny about the night before no one else needed to know that draco was human not yet anyway hermione ate her breakfast quickly occasionally staring down the table at harry and ron who were poring over a small piece of parchment smiles on their faces she wished she was over there with them helping them with whatever scheme they were planning because it was obvious that that was what they were doing hey hermione said a faintly familiar voice from behind her and she turned it was amber hey she said after swallowing her mouthful of food what are you up to she asked as ginny questioned hermione with her eyes oh i just wanted to say hi haventtalked to you in like a week thought maybe things had worked out she said shyly while looking down the table but i see they haven t i sorry for that she said well you cantexpect too much from sixteen year old boys hermione said with a smile oh this is ginny weasley one of my closest friends that are actually speaking to me ginny this is amber solitaire we met after i dumped that pitcher of pumpkin juice all over malfoy head she asked i saw that it was hilarious everyone was laughing when you left we all thought he was going to kill you when he ran after you ginny said what did happen did he follow you hermione sighed inwardly no i hid down the charms corridor then went to the library that when amber saw me and decided to say hi she didntlike lying but she was glad that they both bought it so are you going to go talk to ron and harry ginny asked suddenly she looked a bit apprehensive and hermione raised her eyebrows suspiciously why would i do that they re the ones that re mad at me ginny nodded while once again looking down at her shoes yeah i get that but you cantreally blame them for being upset can you she asked in a small voice and hermione took to defense out of reflex of course i can it wasntmy bloody fault ginny now where is this going hermione asked while meeting ginny eyes they want me to apologize do they she asked and ginny nodded slowly a frown on her face well they can just forget it i expect a full apology from them before i even look their direction again oh but hermione the bell rang and ginny heaved a great sigh you re all a bunch of nutters honestly she huffed loudly and walked away from the table second hand baby blue backpack slung over her shoulder you dontowe them anything hermione amber said and hermione nodded sadly as she tried to avoid looking down the table where she knew ron and harry were getting ready to leave for the first class of the day i know but sometimes it so hard to be right that i think i d rather just be wrong with that hermione threw her backpack over her shoulder and headed to charms see you later amber called after her and hermione waved back entering the charms classroom hermione walked to the front desk and sat placing her open bookbag on the tabletop they had charms with hufflepuff this year and for this hermione was grateful the ravenclaws seemed almost detached towards both gryffindor and hufflepuff but to slytherins they paid an unspoken respect and mutual understanding not to say the ravenclaws were cold or uncivil they just felt more comfortable sticking with those closer to themselves in personality which hermione herself could relate to she often felt overworked with her friends procrastinating and sometimes ridiculous ways but in the end the chaos was well worth the laugh or two they all shared at the end of the day the bell rang again and all the noise stopped once professor flitwick entered and took his seat atop a small pile of books at the front of the class good morning class so we meet again on a friday i hope you will not be too restless today we have quite the lesson planned and i am afraid it will take all of your attention in order to comprehend the new material he said with a wide smile fleshing its way across his face you saying we re dumb professor asked seamus finnigin in a good naturedly un serious tone that d be us then that caused the class to laugh and hermione could not help but smile herself hermione would call seamus the comic relief in their inner circle of gryffindors now that fred and george had set up their own joke shop in hogsmeade and she had to say he was doing a hell of a job in that role settle settle flitwick said jovially now pull out your books and open them to page one hundred thirty seven illusion charms hermione asked out loud as she read the title and flitwick clapped his hands loudly turning to face hermione yes indeed miss granger he said i am looking forward to your excellent performance i ll be needing your help when halloween rolls around this year he then placed his hand over his mouth and gasped my i ve said much too much there were instantly whispers and private conversations throughout the room and only after flitwick banged his ruler on his desk ten times did they all quiet down i would like you all to read through and write down the seven different illusion charms and what their purpose may be in modern wizarding society as well as why they were so important in the past there were groans but hermione jumped right in the whole thing about illusion charms seemed genuinely interesting after completing her normal detailed notes she waited silently for the rest of the class to catch up once everyone was done and had passed it in flitwick went around assigning partners granger potter weasley abbott parvati seamus hermione heart seemed to plummet down into her stomach as she looked at harry he was gathering his things nonchalantly but she knew that once he got over to her that he would give her the same cold treatment he had been bent on giving her all week hey hermione harry said happily and hermione was taken aback by his utter friendliness well someone seems a bit unfriendly he said with a smile and hermione nodded then shook her head to correct herself hi i though you and ron no ron i have no qualm with you that was over with almost a week ago hermione i donthold grudges hermione looked at ron at the other table and saw that he was scowling is he still upset yeah but you know ron he ll bounce back in a day or two he whispered and hermione nodded there was hope at last land boy that a load off my shoulders i ve been worried sick about how you two were getting along harry gave her a stern look and his green eyes seemed to look right through her look i have to talk to you about something he said very quietly just above a whisper harry we re supposed to be but she stopped in mid sentence seeing the very serious and perturbed look in harry face what is it i put malfoy in the hospital wing a week and a half ago he said and hermione jaw dropped that not all how much more could there possibly be i saw what he did to you i wanted to keep an eye on you during detention and well i fell victim to rage and in the end retribution i guess he scratched his neck nervously while looking at her for some kind of reaction i dontunderstand what would you have done to put him in the hospital wing and second of all what in blazes are you doing walking around the school in the middle of the night harry she asked and he held his finger to his lip to quiet her steadily rising voice it not safe she lectured and he rolled his eyes i know but in case you haventnoticed i like my friends a lot more than i like my wand i was worried and it seems to have turned out that my worries were founded look what he did to you he said and hermione glared and what is that may i ask she said and her voice hinted that unless he wanted a fresh case of acne that he should walk on eggshells you werentexactly a social butterfly to begin with he began and hermione eyes narrowed even further and well ginny told me that you werentsleeping in the girls dormitory at gryffindor tower and that worries me you ve become a recluse since he did whatever he did to you now you re worried about me is this intentional role reversal because i dontknow if i like it harry she said and he smiled weakly look when this whole thing blows over i want you to keep your distance from malfoy he seems to have a way of persuading people to do what he wants as you know he warned and she nodded i not thick but thanks for your advice she said bitterly and harry sighed in frustration i didntsay you were thick it just it happened and now we have to be worried he ll try to do it again he spoke even quieter now and hermione had to lean forward to even hear what he was saying it obvious that he has developed some sick obsession with you hermione burst out laughing and many people including ron turned to look at her as she giggled non stop please hermione exclaimed in a whisper after everyone had gone back to his or her own business malfoy has no more of an obsession with me than a a hound to a cat we are polar opposites harry i wasntimplying it was a two way attraction hermione just stay away from him all right look harry you donthave to tell me once let alone twice but you do have to stop roaming around school in the middle of the night hiding under your he voice went lower as she said invisibility cloak and you have to tell me what you did to get him into the hospital wing she could tell harry noticed the small smirk on her face and he trusted her with the information he was alone down the deserted hallway around the prefectorial commons and no one else was in sight i saw it as the perfect opportunity to get him back for being more than a bit rough with you he said defensively so i waited until he let down his defenses and i tackled him i was in my invisibility cloak and well go on hermione prompted while checking to see what progress others had made on their assignment i broke his neck i think hermione head snapped back in his direction and he looked almost green he flipped over and landed on his neck with the most sickening crack and then he passed out he said and she could tell he really felt remorse i tried to help him but he his pulse was gone so i called for help and ran off he could have died hermione said hey one less death eater to kill your family your friends he said darkly what he asked indignantly you cantpretend that i wouldnthave done the world a kindness in ridding it of another malfoy he said with a wicked tone how do you know he even a death eater she asked in a disgusted tone as she looked at one of the people she thought she knew the most does it matter malfoy are bad news in general and who to say he not a death eater harry said with a bitter frown that made hermione shiver involuntarily i cannot even believe you harry this is so wrong she whispered and he nodded slowly i canthelp hating him hermione you ve got you understand that the only family i ever had that loved me they re all gone because people like him grow up to be people like lucius malfoy and voldemort and every other death eater that has no problem killing innocent people he said there a reason i in gryffindor but thoughts like these make me feel as though slytherin where i truly belong his voice trailed off and hermione opened his book to the right page and pushed it towards him take a break harry she suggested softly if you think to much about something it becomes meaninglessly over dwelled and it loses significance to those who it should be most important to she could tell her voice soothed him even if her words did not and she touched his shoulder he cringed then relaxed under her touch what do you say to me and you taking a walk tonight we can talk in the prefect commons she suggested and he nodded looking up at her that sounds nice i have a lot on my back and ron isntthe most understanding person when he mad at you harry said suggestively and hermione smiled widely and what is that supposed to mean harry she asked playfully and harry shrugged dunno could it be that he smitten he said and hermione shrugged why he so mad at me still she asked sadly and harry pulled out his wand and set it on their desk because he wounded you broke up with him and there also the fact that you were right and he was wrong but you definitely cannot forget the other information i have on him he likes you so much that he has to equal or exceed your standards and he feels inadequate and not up to the job harry said and hermione guffawed who told you that load of rubbish ron just as good at everything that i am harry nodded sarcastically straight from the horse mouth i tell you and with that they went to work every once in a while having a good laugh at their own expense at the end of class while they were cleaning up flitwick approached hermione and sent harry off to achieve some mundane task yes professor hermione asked as she packed her things carefully and neatly yes well i was wondering how you were doing with the illusion charms he said a great amount of anticipation was bubbling over the brim of his demeanor and hermione smiled very well i think i do better with these charms than the summoning and banishment ones hermione said truthfully and he once again clapped his hands excitingly you remember how i slipped up earlier he asked and hermione nodded that was a distraction what i really need your help with is the yule ball dontlook so surprised it was so successful last year that dumbledore i mean professor atkinson has suggested that we hold it once again he said quickly when were they planning to tell us all hermione asked with a frown the day before christmas you see it all supposed to be hush hush there will be a prefect meeting on the tenth of november but you have to get those charms down pat as well as the other prefects he said looking around nervously and hermione realized she had to look nearly to her feet to meet his eyes properly i believe the only other prefect who caught on as quickly was mr malfoy he seems to be brilliant at everything i throw at him as well well besides that practice makes perfect oh there the bell be off now miss granger he turned and walked away and someone grabbed hermione shoulder she turned to stare into harry eyes time to go wouldntwant to be late to care of magical creatures with the slytherins now would we he said sarcastically where ron hermione asked as she looked around already left he probably already down at hagrid hut setting up he taken a liking to hagrid this year i think harry said but hermione knew the reason he had left so quickly was because of her you know what harry hermione asked bitterly as they walked through the front doors what ron can go sod off i ve had enough she stated rhetorically as she stomped her foot against the paved steps if he cantcome to his own bloody senses he can regret it later i moving on now i shouldnthave to walk on eggshells because ron sensitive she said mockingly and harry looked in her direction in surprise that doesntsound like you talking hermione he declared while running a hand through his jet black hair well harry say hello to the new hermione i not going to take everyone shit all the time anymore i tired of everyone thinking i just there to be trodden on she growled i have feelings too and it damn selfish of him to think the way he does oh poor me this pity me that harry looked as though he was about to laugh when they were interrupted by the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy so the gryffindorks together again are they he asked bugger off malfoy hermione said while prompting harry to contain himself so now it malfoy eh i see how it is mudblood draco said in a falsely hurt voice but then again he began maliciously once a gryffindor slut always a gryffindor slut he said and his friends laughed they reached the platform next to hagrid hut and hermione decided she wasntlistening but his next words were loud enough for everyone to hear i mean honestly once weaselby gets done with her potter swoops in will it always be a sickening love triangle the source of harry potter heartbreak oh please malfoy hermione said we all just know that if two slytherins liked the same girl they d tear her to pieces to be the first to get to her heart slytherins are just big clumsy blokes who forget to groom themselves properly or try too hard in your case malfoy in fact you look very much like a girl today her voice trailed off and there was laughter around the paddock you re dead he shouted and there were gasps as he walked forwards dropping his book bag off to the side how dare you even look at me he gave her a small nudge in the chest and her fist made contact with his side no hermione said turning to the rest of the class not even the great draco malfoy gets to hit me it must not be love i so very disappointed before she could say another sarcastic word she was on the ground draco had grabbed her ankles and she was now fighting to get out from underneath him no one was stepping forward to help they all wanted to see the outcome of the ultimate struggle top boy against top girl slytherin against gryffindor pureblood against mudblood it was the perfect fight the outcome not even hermione could say at this point he outweighed her by more than sheer strength it turned out he was also much heavier than her and gravity was no friend of hermione in this kind of situation it turned out ready to give in draco whispered close to her ear and hermione brought her knee up almost gracefully no not in a long shot you git she said as he rolled over groaning in pain that only a man could understand hermione got up and dusted off her skirt while looking around most of the males had a half admiring half fearful look on their faces draco goons were helping him stand and he was whimpering insolently i never thought anything you could do to malfoy would ever make me feel sympathy for him but hermione that was harsh harry said and as she looked around she saw ron watching them all from the gate he had grown much taller over their last summer apart and he had almost completely filled out his skeleton though he still looked tall and lanky hermione saw the smile on his face as he looked on and she felt for the first time in the past few days that everything would work out things were back to normal it was obvious that their little exchange of words hadntchanged anything between hermione and draco and that in itself was a relief she would hate to have had to tell ron and harry they had to play nice then again hermione didntthink that would ever happen not now not in a thousand years slytherins were slytherins gryffindors were gryffindors and it seemed a proven fact that things would always return to that same sane and logical order in the end but the thing that hermione had not counted on was a change of heart from the most unlikely of people and like all good things all bad things too must come to an end hermione knew this but who was to say it had to be now or even any time soon well no one so it didn t hagrid walked out from behind his hut and spoke briefly with ron before sending his off to join harry and hermione ron what he got planned for today harry asked and ron frowned hermione inwardly sighed the look on ron face did not convey good news you ll never guess i ll bet you ron offered and harry shook his head while shrugging well i reckon it not as bad as those skrewts in fourth year but they re not exactly peace driven i tell you he said as he shoved his hands in his pockets and looked around well hermione began what are she was cut off as there were gasps from the front near the fence my god hermione whispered as she looked upon a face or three that she had not seen in five years why on earth would he bring fluffy out here hermione asked in awe he says she tamed down a bit but this right here contradicts his precious fluffy innocence he said and hermione turned back towards him watching in horror as ron pulled up the sleeve of his robe and revealed a bandaged forearm its teeth barely grazed my arm bled like a bitch though he said and met hermione eyes gather round class come on no reason to be frigh ened hagrid voice boomed around the clearing and the class hesitantly moved towards the gate gryffindors in the front with slytherins trailing doggedly behind now anyone know what this is hagrid asked and three gryffindors raised their hands yes arry ermione an ron come up ere he said and they took two more steps forward they ve actually come face ter face with fluffy ere a time or two he said and their were gasps and oh s i used to have one as a pet said someone and hagrid searched the class for the source of the comment eh malfoy come on up ere as well then i guess hagrid barked briskly and draco hesitated now malfoy i want you all up ere he ordered and hermione watched draco whisper something under his breath to his two goons all right then you big brute he said as he stepped forward and leveled himself with the three gryffindors whom hermione reminded them all to give him fresh glares of hatred watch that mouth a yers malfoy hagrid growled quietly then told them all to pull out thier books page seven we ll be learnin about cerberuses today as you all can see i own one and she the prettiest brute y ell ever see looking upon the three headed gigantic pit bull she felt the same exact fear of the creature she had felt when she first met it in that dark room so long before can anyone tell me the roman myth behind fluffy here asked hagrid and a few people around the yard raised their hands slowly as if they were afraid they were going to be called up to the front as well seamus bin a while since you ve gotten ter answer a question hagrid said and seamus smiled widely cerberuses in mythology were considered the dark guards of hades or hell modern experiments have confirmed their natural instinct to guard but note their only weakness soft music seamus winked at harry hermione and ron he had heard their story a million times by now and knew exactly what fluffy weakness was along with the rest of gryffindor tower hagrid clapped and nodded well said seamus they re also native to england but at one point they were almost led to extinction from hunting in the seventeenth century the rest of the class went very well and when the bell rang hermione hurried inside for lunch then headed off to arithmancy her new favorite class it was hard but well worth it as hermione entered the class she sat at her assigned table and waited for malfoy to arrive so that she could ask him what the hell his problem was but she didntget the chance because as soon as he sat down class began and they had little next to no time to talk at all today they were learning techniques for deciphering codes and even though hermione had no idea what this had to do with arithmancy she excelled as always and was surprisingly enough the second done with their in class assignment looking over to draco his cold gray eyes met hers and she stared for a moment into his all too human eyes he looked real all of the sudden with a bit of dirt on his cheek from their care of magical creatures scuffle and he was hopefully sporting bruised pride he had flecks of dirt in his usually perfectly groomed silvery blond hair and the look on his face was formidable to contriteness looking towards the front she allowed a smile to touch her face malfoy was back on earth where he belonged and she was the one who had put him there she began humming quietly and she was sure he recognized the tune who couldn t i walking on sunshine a whoa whoa and dontit feel good change you walk the darkness alone demons and devils dance in your head care and compassion you ve never been shown lies and rejection is all your fed you creep along the sturdy wall searching for the light then your bitten and you fall melt into the night you no longer feel helpless and alone you know now your real into your world you ve been blown thank you so much to suicidalrainbow on for letting me use her wonderful poem yes i asked otherwise it d be plagiarism this is so what i think draco is feeling or what hermione is assuming about him inference doesntnecissarily make an ass out of you or me finally sorry people during chapter thirteen my life went through many problems first and foremost i blame on mr writer block my arch i would have to blame myself i planned to have this chapter the one after it and the one before it as one iway over extended myself and i am sure that this chapter undeivided would have been well over thirty thousand words and that would have taken forever so here it is and if it seems incomplete and you dontlike it bite me chapter 13 the beginning an f hermione asked breathlessly her hands falling to her sides in disbelief an f she stuttered her hands began to shake as her blood rushed through her body and her face warmed considerably f her voice trailed off and she sat down dark began walking to the front of the class but hermione could only see the red spots in front of her eyes suddenly she stood and banged her fist on the desk as hard as she could i did not write that paper it should not count against my grade she said resolutely hermione could not accept this and whose grade should it count against you handed it in miss granger and you will take the grade i give you dark waited for an angry reply but hermione just sat down glancing tearfully at malfoy who may have looked like her best friend at the moment but was nothing at all like him she knew that he was the one who had changed her paper he was the only one with access to the prefect commons and he certainly had a grudge but hermione knew that she had to resign to the facts there was no way to prove it hermione returned to reading but harry and ron couldntlet things sit professor does that mean none of us get credit harry shouted why would i give you all an f when miss granger is the one who wrote the paper dark asked quietly as she turned her chair idly looking up at them because if hermione got an f than there is no way anyone got a better score or even a score at all she is the smartest sixth year out of all of us ron said and there were quiet whispers of agreement from the gryffindor side while the slytherin side erupted in boo and vulgar comments that is not true there is one student in this class that had already topped miss granger mr weasley draco malfoy is the only student in this class with an a and he certainly though he may look like a gryffindor of sorts right now is not miss granger dark replied smugly now get back to work please we have much to learn in these next few days and i dontneed students blatant arrogance to contend with as well hermione gave ron a weak smile there could be worse things i suppose she said sadly and ron shook his head like what this assignment was huge massive and can you even imagine how much this will lower your grade this will put you out of the running for that job you wanted so badly hermione nodded she was at least glad he was so concerned that so unfair what a wench harry added and suddenly hermione realized how grateful she was to have her two best friends back on her side no big deal you guys at least she didntmark you both down she said and she was completely and surprisingly sincere come on let finish reading before she has more reason to mark us down further hermione suggested and the other two complied dontknow how that git got a better grade than you do you reckon he snogging dark ron asked after a few minutes of reading it was obvious he had been brooding something ron was very good at do you think dark stupid ron hermione asked and besides that she not his type they and harry shared a secret laugh at professor dark expense as well as draco s gone were the days when hermione would defend him she was now very positive that he could handle that all on his own and if not he could expect a lot of problems from hogwarts favorite gryffindors he may have gotten the job but draco hell was just beginning from harry and ron side of it anyway hermione heard stories over the next few days that made her laugh like she had never laughed before but eventually the pranks lost their fun and became senseless acts of loathing harry and ron were having the time of their lives though and she had not the heart to ask them to cease she could tell draco was miserable and she felt a certain sense of satisfaction whenever she had class with him to see him in his current state on the morning of the day that they would find out who got the job for arithmancy hermione felt unusually jittery even though her chances were minuscule since her grade in dada had dropped she still hoped it was a great opportunity and if draco got it it would only reinforce the subconscious ideal that pure bloods were better groomed for such things going through the day normally was probably the hardest thing hermione had had to do in a while sure she had done much more before but this was solely for herself and on those rare occasions she tended to find difficulty in concentrating entering the arithmancy classroom for double arithmancy hermione walked to hers and draco table and sat down she had been the first to turn in her application and cameron had not been very pleased with her dada grade when hermione explained what happened cameron had nodded saying everything would be cleared up if not by her than by mcgonagall this is what had given hermione her boost of hope and gotten her through the past few days draco walked in minutes before the bell rang and sat doggedly in his seat hermione threw him a smug but furtive glance and the look that he returned she swore could have killed her having a nice day she asked smartly and draco growled something under his breath it d be even nicer if your friends left me alone they re asking for it he said slowly i ve already taken the maximum amount of points a prefect can take from a house in a single day and they just keep coming back for more i figure it ll all add up to about a thousand at the end of the year when they take the block off the hourglasses he added and hermione laughed i doubt they will allow you to take that many points for getting what you deserve hermione replied you shouldnthave done it and now well you get what you and i both know is equal retribution no equal retribution would be turning my hair blue or putting tacks on my seat something like that he said while turning to face her his gray eyes bore into hers and she felt her stomach clench he was tired what they re doing is harassment and if it doesntstop i ll make sure that if they are aloud to go to the ball they wontbe able to enjoy themselves as intimidating as your threats are malfoy as you ve proven to us all at one point or another your threats mean no more than anything else you say hermione said through gritted teeth you cower like a beaten dog when you re confronted by anything you did not instigate yourself i concede your point granger but all in all i am fully capable of exacting my revenge as you have experienced first hand draco replied wisely yeah you have guts hermione said and the shocked expression on his face was enough to make her finish when it girls you re exacting your revenge on draco nodded with a flagrant smile spreading across his face as he turned his eyes back to the front wait and see she heard him whisper under his breath the bell rang before she could say more and cameron walked into the room a large folder under her arm i hope it not more of the stupid portfolios those were a major waste of time hermione said dread filling her chest hello class how are you all today there were mumbles around the room and hermione raised her hand have something specific to share with us miss granger cameron asked and hermione shook her head i just wanted to know if you had read through all of the applications and made a decision yet she said and there were murmurs of equal interest yes madame pince and i spent the past week reading through all of your applications and have reached a final decision cameron announced and the room if possible went even quieter i would first like to say that some of you had very exceptional applications some of you had less than exceptional and an even smaller amount of you neglected to turn them in at all which frustrates me to no end the assignment was essentially a free hundred points she paused giving a stern look around the room the students who squirmed in their seats hermione assumed were the ones who didntturn theirs in now i doubt it will come as a surprise to any of you that our first choice was mr draco malfoy our sixth year slytherin prefect she said and hermione heart plummeted that was it he had won there were cheers boo s and every other sound a group of teenagers could make without being too immature hermione took in a deep breath and let it out slowly calmly but our decision we realized needed to be based upon the fully rounded student we were choosing and that would mean coming to the obvious conclusion that two of you would have to be chosen hermione was now fully alert again she had a feeling that this whole thing would turn around but it also seemed as if that was what every other student was thinking as well for it was dead silent in the classroom something that it hadntbeen for a month miss granger you have been chosen as well you and mr malfoy will be splitting the wages since we cannot afford to pay two full separate wages but i doubt it was about the money to you cameron gave hermione a short wink and hermione smiled she should have had more faith in her and in cameron two prefects cameron began that certainly should be incentive to be an exceptional all around student mr malfoy miss granger could you both please meet me after class today so that i may show you your work space explain the rules and give you a list of the passwords i will also need to introduce you to the other students you will be working with from advanced rune studies all right hermione nodded and saw draco do the same her heart was beating wildly fast she was so excited the rest of the lesson was a breeze for her and it didnteven put a damper on her spirits when malfoy ranted under his breath for the better part of the rest of the period when the bell rang she threw her stuff into her bag and leapt up watch it granger someone going to lose an eye it really not that great that you won as well you know he mumbled and hermione shoved her chair in with a loud bang that made him jump for once malfoy just once resign to the fact that there is nothing you can do about your current situation and shove it she exclaimed exasperatingly there is something i can do granger and i assure you it will be done as soon as i get a pen and paper in hand draco choked on his next words and they turned into a garbled mess at the end of his tongue hermione saw his guard fall for just a second as his composure slipped but before she could even take it in he was back you will see exactly what i can do without my father he took a menacing step forward his fist clenching at his side so tightly hermione could see the bones of his knuckles through his skin prove it honestly you re about as scary as a hephalump on ice skates malfoy and you and i both know if you laid a hand on me but she was interrupted come on now put your differences aside you re partners now said cameron kindly but seriously now follow me we have a lot to cover in such a short time we need to collect the ravenclaw on the way to the library so put on your walking feet and get moving so this was cameron out of arithmancy hermione thought with a smile odd they began walking and cameron insisted on making light conversation your other partner samuel truitt is an a student as well he in his seventh year but he not got any special appointments she said quickly as she sped their pace the slightest bit it was a real kicker when he wrote me telling me he d missed the head boy position never heard such a sad boy draco sighed loudly and hermione resisted the urge to elbow him in the side how do you know him hermione asked and cameron smiled i used to teach at a pre school for magically oriented children he was the best student i ever encountered and we ve kept in touch over the years she spoke fondly of him and hermione deducted that he must have been a good kid he partly the reason i got this job i suppose they asked for any recommendations i had in mind and well he was so dear to me and his father i sure would say so many good things that i had to give it a go she blushed and hermione smiled it was a smile only two girls could understand so draco to what do you owe your excellent grades i know that i can attribute miss granger to her great aspirations to reach her full potential but you i haventquite figured you out yet she said it as a half question half statement and hermione could tell draco was all but ready to share his story there nothing to figure out really he said calmly and hermione glanced at him his head was down watching his feet as they walked my father taught me to be the best and i ve tried and that it story over he finished with a nod to himself and cameron gave a short laugh there has to be something in it for you cameron said seriously we re out of class draco i am not your teacher at the moment i am your employer cameron said proudly what could there be in it for me i go to class everyday see the same people do the same things learn the same things and want the same things it nothing new a story that been told a million times before he said and hermione sensed a tone of bitterness underlying his apathetic exterior if that were the truth you wouldnthave told crabbe and goyle to bugger off hermione began under her breath and draco looked towards her so fast she was shocked he didntget whiplash i heard about it from harry his friend was in your charms class when it happened no one else knows she assured him haltingly you had all better hope so where is this ravenclaw dorm draco asked as he looked around looking at everything through suspicious gray eyes they had been walking for over ten minutes and she could tell he was getting nervous and she found that she couldntblame him at all we re here actually cameron said and she gave three taps of her wand on a suit of armor hermione gasped as she saw the helmet jaw drop to the floor and widen enough for a person to fit through dontthink this is an open dorm kids she said with a smile it location changes every other day and the number of taps is never the same twice i ll guarantee draco scoffed and hermione agreed with him why would they want to get into the ravenclaw dorm with gryffindors and slytherins were the ones at war hold on professor called a voice from the inside hermione marveled at the echoing sound his voice made it was as if he was inside the suit of armor here i am there was a loud crash as a very tall and lanky boy tripped through the opening and knocked hermione over so sorry here let me lend you a hand there he said stupidly as a blush of embarrassment spread across his face no dontbother hermione said testily i can do it she snapped and he backed away yes she always this rude and no there is no way to get away from her once she targeted you for hell draco muttered and hermione glared that is enough mr malfoy cameron said hermione is not rude at all samuel it is draco that needs to be coached in manners she finished and samuel nodded shyly right he said uncomfortably where re we headed then he asked and cameron smiled softly her glasses sliding to the end of her nose the library i going to introduce you all to the documents that will be your job for however long you wish to keep it cameron stated and she stepped off in the opposite direction they had come upon entering the library hermione could feel the hairs on the back of her neck stand straight up she could feel strong magic very near and she almost immediately found the source there was a blue force field around an archway in the far corner what was beyond the door was invisible due to a charm and hermione felt her palms turn moist this opportunity was amazing and she was ready to take full advantage of it as soon as they entered ah madame pince we have the students cameron said and the librarian looked over each of them with great scrutiny and suspicion she walked over to the force field and pulled her wand out but before she canceled the charm she looked back to the three of them be damn careful with these documents or it ll be your heads on my wall she said her eyes directing their attention to a few rare animal heads on a plaque nailed to the wall now now marie they are just students i am sure they will be very careful with the documents teacher honor madame pince frowned further and muttered a spell under her breath here give these to the bunch of hooligans the librarian said while thrusting three small folded sheets of paper into cameron hands if they lose it they wontbe receiving a copy and i ll charge them out of their pay for the paper and the time it will take to generate and set in place a new list of passwords yes marie but try to keep in mind as well that they are doing both of us a bit of a favor neither of us have the time nor energy to put fully into this project we have stumbled upon cameron seemed a bit perturbed at how madame pince was acting and hermione could not agree more they were doing a job that would consume most of their free time after school on weekends and over holidays right well as soon as they grow up enough to be considered responsible for the project i suppose i will madame pince replied shortly now the password for this week is consortia look up the name in mr binns curriculum book and you will find a plethora of information concerning consortia and her importance to our world every password on our list is related to consortia so it would do you some good to learn a bit more about her they all nodded in agreement and madame pince looked mildly pleased consortia she said and the blue force field dissipated in a rush of glowing tendrils sent in all directions follow me they all watched as madame pince stepped inside the pointed archway and followed after cameron of course looking around hermione marveled at the aged surroundings everything was covered in a thick acrid layer of dust that made it hard to breathe properly and she sneezed a large table was placed in the center of the small room and all over the table were several stacks of files and papers at least one foot high on the floor though there was even more and hermione learned quickly that unless she wanted a nasty look from madame pince she would watch her feet as she tried to make her way through the mazes of stacks and loose sheaves of parchment scattered across the floor this is your office madame pince informed the three of them if you dontlike its current condition do whatever you like to make it up to your standards you may dust the documents and you may clean things up and organize it but not under any circumstances will these documents ever leave this room is this understood she looked each one of them in the eyes with only the greatest scrutiny and they all nodded without hesitation madame pince was slightly creepy at the moment all right cameron interrupted let get to how things are organized currently she said it looks like a free for all of documents that were thrown together in a moment of great rush and carelessness draco commented dryly as he looked around an expression of disgust on his face right you are mr malfoy there is no organization at all i can only tell you that documents on the table are more current than the ones scattered about the floor and are obviously more important cameron stated with clear confidence i suggest you three schedule your first day of work to be an organizing and cleaning day it will have to be a weekend and you will get paid the full wage of a weekend but i warn you it will take time and patience when are we allowed to start working hermione asked and cameron wagged her finger at hermione that is the greatest thing about this job you ve been given miss granger you make your own hours and you can start as soon as today and work as often as you like however you may not skip any other classes besides arithmancy but in order to do that you must ask my permission and have me sign a sheet of paper saying where you will be cameron clapped her hands together and looked around the room her eyes sparkling with excitement for them all come on marie we should leave them to get acquainted with one another cameron said and madame pince reluctantly followed cameron out of the room hermione looked around one more time before taking a few steps forward and pulling a chair out she sat silently at the table and folded her hands in front of her after another minute she reached her hand out slowly and grabbed a piece of parchment from the nearest pile these are really complicated hermione informed the others some of these equations i have never seen before we re going to need a more advanced book for charms i ll talk to professor flitwick and see if he has any books that he would recommend for this hermione offered that d be great samuel said and i doubt it would hurt if we got a book of latin as well my latin isntas up to date as it was fresh out of my youth academy he said and draco scoffed i know all the latin we need you re susceptible to human error whereas a book is not but hermione was interrupted once again by draco i know all the latin we need hermione met his eyes and they were fixed on hers with a cold glare that made him look oddly scary i know more latin than any book you will ever find does and it may help that i know three different dialects as well i d be much more comfortable getting a book who to say that we will all be in here at the same time hermione asked if i know you even half as well as i think i do and you know me half as well as you think you do than you can answer that question all on your own as for samuel i cannot speak for him hermione opened her mouth to argue but draco held up his hand fine get the damn book i dontgive a shit but if the books wrong i burning it so dontborrow anything from anyone whose too attached he warned seriously and hermione shrugged sometimes it just easier to stop when no one yelling and hermione had the feeling that that was the direction in which this conversation was heading samuel shifted his weight from foot to foot uncomfortably and hermione turned to him is something wrong she asked and he shook his head quickly no it just very obvious you all are very passionate about what you re doing and i feel like i wontbe contributing enough i dontplan on spending every second of my spare time in here and from the way you two argue you both were you know he asked and hermione nodded well what the best day for you all to have our little organization day she asked and draco coughed i was thinking saturday he offered and hermione shook her head that is the only day i get to see my friends they re always so busy i think friday after school gets over would be fine draco nodded and they both turned their attention to samuel who was shaking his head sunday would be best for me unless you two want to give it a go by yourselves he said softly why cantyou do it on friday hermione asked and draco nodded in agreement i have a wizard chess club meeting right after last class and they subtract points for absences i could lose as much as one game worth of points depending on how important the meeting was and at this point i neck and neck with some slimy slytherin no offense and i cantafford the lost points samuel replied and hermione nodded i cantdo it on sunday draco said i always do my homework on sunday and this week i have more than usual can no one change their schedule hermione asked and from the expression on draco and samuel faces she guessed not fine dra malfoy and i will do it together but you owe us from the look on draco face she knew he must have noticed her near slip of the tongue right then what do you want samuel asked and he pulled his wallet out of his pocket not money you git work you forfeit work for your club you pay us in work how about we organize all the documents and leave a section of it for you to do yourself she suggested that way you can catch up do it on your own time and you wontget behind nor will either of you have to alter your schedules she gave a look to each of them and they nodded friday draco repeated well i have much to do i should probably get going then samuel said excusing himself and hermione nodded yes madame pince is probably wearing herself out wondering why we ve been in here so long remember malfoy friday right after school hermione preached and draco gave her a mock salute right granger friday i look forward to it with the utmost dread and trepidation as i am sure you feel the same draco commented flamboyantly while smirking but alas since cameron decided she wanted to be partial to her fellow gryffindors i ll have to adjust to the unfairness draco she said slowly after samuel had left she was a hufflepuff and with that she turned and left the room a smile on her face and a song on her mind donthate me cuz i right hate me cuz i beautiful hey ron can you finish this part for me i have to talk to professor flitwick about something ron nodded dipped his quill in ink when harry gets back tell him that the answer to number twelve is alohomora he always had trouble with that one ron rolled his eyes but said nothing hermione stood and walked to the desk at the front of the classroom where flitwick sat upon his mountain of books miss granger he asked and he set his quill down i was wondering if you had any advanced charms books i have an arithmancy project and our up to date charms books arentexactly adequate for the task at hand she said quietly and he nodded say no more i happen to have some right here help me up dear he said and hermione took his arm helping him to the floor where he stood at least two feet shorter than her now i need your word that you wonttry to learn any of these charms without first going through the proper procedures you remember now dontyou first you need to ask is this a spell i can use for good next you need to ask yourself if it is dangerous if so ask an adult to help you three always practice with a partner in case something goes terribly wrong and you re turned into some kind of worm yes professor i took all the notes and know all of the procedures flitwick smiled i should have guessed take as many volumes as you need and if you need any help at all i am quite good at charms is there anything else he asked and hermione thought as she stacked three rather large charms books into her arms actually professor do you happen to have any latin books she asked and he shook his head no i afraid that is not my area of expertise he said remorsefully i would suggest asking either minerva or severus they both speak it fluently hermione nodded said thank you and walked back to ron and hers table more books woman are you mad you already have ten in your bag it going to be damn near impossible for you to carry ron said but hermione fit each one in one by one you put a charm on it didntyou i should have guessed i hate it when you say that i should have guessed it like you re saying that i predictable hermione said with a frown as she met his eyes i hate it ron nodded though she knew he didntquite get it it d be like me going ron here my homework since i know you didntdo it ron smiled and hermione got the hint i shouldnthave to do it i do it because i actually care about your grades and missed something did i asked a playful voice behind them and hermione turned to see harry hermione was just telling me how spontaneous and unpredictable she is how she a woman on the edge she got nothing to lose harry looked at hermione then at ron and they both burst out laughing enough over there keep working lest i have to separate you three hermione packed up her things and threw her bag over her shoulder it fine professor i was just moving she walked to an empty table in the back and pulled out her book and a piece of parchment harry and ron looked at her and she started working next thing she knew the two chairs next to her were being pulled out and ron and harry sat down sorry but you re not fooling anyone when you say you re anything other than structured and organized face it if there a test coming up everyone knows where you are if there isnta test we all know where you are if there is nothing at all to do and it snowing outside we all know where you are harry clapped her on the back there nothing wrong with being predictable at least you get everything done hermione nodded and sighed if i didntfeel like i had to i wouldn t she said and harry shook his head yes and we all know it but since you do feel it we can only love you more for it a joke here and there is no big deal right it not like we make fun of you every time you turn around ron silently agreed now this new charms obsession harry said and hermione and ron laughed it not an obsession harry i got that arithmancy job harry looked insulted as if she hadnttried to tell him i haventspent enough time in the same room as you to tell you harry nodded a grin spreading across his face so malfoy didntget it yes score one for the muggle borns he said quietly and she smiled lightly no we both did professor cameron looked over some of my other work from dada and decided the f was undeserved considering it was obviously not my handiwork hermione said proudly was malfoy pissed he asked and hermione nodded vigorously yes he almost started a fight during class he was turning apple red and everything hermione said honestly it serves him right for doing what he did to my paper i suppose i should be a bit more civil towards him though she conceded and harry and ron jaws dropped why on earth would you want to do that ron asked and hermione motioned for him to be quiet flitwick eyes were roaming the room for the source of the outburst why ron repeated once flitwick went back to grading his papers because i have to work with him and if every time we see each other we raise our wands we re not going to get any work done at all hermione replied in a whisper and besides wouldntwant him to find some sick way to retaliate since we all know he so good at it from the significant look he gave her hermione could tell that harry understood but ron was still perplexed as to why she would want to even treat malfoy like a human why hermione rolled her eyes and went back to work i cantgo to hagrid hut with you guys on friday hermione informed them after the bell rang and they were packing their stuff away why not i told hagrid we would all be there you know we go every friday harry said and hermione saw the slightly wounded look in his eyes i have to work on friday we re having an organization party minus the fun and games she said doggedly it ll be only malfoy and me because our other partner has to go to chess club and he doesntwant to lose his position to a slytherin which i can understand let malfoy have a got at it on his own he more of the type to do something on his own never seemed like much of a team player ron suggested and hermione shook her head that not a solution i would even consider if i left it up to malfoy it wouldntget done so you think you think that no matter what if your re not breathing down someone neck nothing going to get done and now hagrid going to be disappointed is malfoy worth it honestly harry asked and hermione frowned you know it not about malfoy at all harry dontbe difficult she said sternly and he nodded reluctantly i have to do my part in this thing because if i don t well you both know how i am now let go transfiguration next and form what i heard from amber it going to be loads of fun and so it was they spent the whole period trying to turn their quills into kitchen utensils as usual neville failed to say the incantation properly and was headed up to the hospital wing fifteen minutes into class a spoon melded onto his nose that one had them all laughing for quite a while near the end of class the hufflepuffs werentoverly pleased when one of seamus stray spells hit one of their peers causing chaos as the hufflepuff ran around blindly cursing anything and everything as random as he could even mcgonagall cracked a smile when this happened and hermione was happy to say that she was very pleased to see that mcgonagall had teeth after all and the rumors were not true the rest of the week went well until thursday which was when hermione began to dread friday draco was more malicious than ever towards her and she was growing more and more confident in the assumption that malfoy was quite capable of making her fear for her life and there was always the fact that they would be alone together in a small room for god only knows how long despite draco ever serious protests hermione did ask mcgonagall for a book on latin and to harry and ron surprise she was brave enough to ask snape as well of course he refused saying he was much too fond of his fifty year old antique tattered frayed and torn book to let just anyone who asked borrow it hermione had expected no less so in advanced she had gotten permission from mcgonagall to check out a latin book from the reference section of the library it was rather large and bulky but it wasntlikely that she would carry it around on her back everyday so it made little difference due to hermione bad luck friday fell on her least favorite schedule she had dada history of magic and double potions at the end of the day that allowed for her to leave school pissed and carry it into her workspace perfect hermione was right in her assumption that friday was going to be a bad day fist off she got up late and had to skip breakfast putting her in a fowl mood even before she stepped into the dada classroom then dark had had the pluck to accuse her of using her friendship with her arithmancy teacher to get her way which started a class long argument that she knew wasntover even when she left the classroom and the final straw was predictably potions snape broke up the gryffindor dream team once again and forced her to work with millicent bullstrode a not very petite fifth year that had the intelligence of a worm but the muscles of a champion weight lifter millicent through the course of the period succeeded in dumping hermione cauldron all down her front knocking her out of her seat elbowing her in the face while just raising her hand and calling her a string of filthy names that would make a prostitute blush and just when hermione had decided she had had enough the bell rang and millicent spilled all of her slug bile out all over the floor telling snape that hermione had knocked it out of her hand so the first fifteen minutes after class hermione spent on her knees scrubbing the floor until it was cleaned to snape satisfaction the next time you decided to be blatantly violent towards your rival house you will find yourself with a detention slip signed by me and i doubt you want to spend an hour with me inside of class let alone outside of it do we understand one another miss granger yes professor hermione said her voice dripping with open anger and hostility towards the potions master may i go now she asked and snape gave a short laugh yes you ve taken up enough of my time granger just remember what i said he motioned towards the door and hermione stormed out of his classroom a scowl on her face which was twisted with rage ridiculous hermione shouted as she dropped the charms books she had obtained onto the large old wooden desk in the center of the room you re late granger malfoy said and hermione scoffed i decided not to start without you i hope you didntexpect otherwise he added almost thoughtfully oh no of course not why would i expect you to work without someone there to watch you and praise you for your success hermione asked bitterly and he glared she looked around the dank poorly lit room and pulled out her wand this will not do at all there barely enough light to see anything let alone to read and work lumos as soon as the word left her mouth the end of her wand lit and she pointed it at each and every candle which lit and glowed brightly even after the light at the tip of her wand had been extinguished that more like it now where to start i brought some folders to use for organization since i figured you had the book thing covered draco offered as he placed his book bag on the table and opened it hermione watched as he pulled out folder after folder until the stack was a foot high only fifty she asked after she had finished counting and hermione placed her hands on her hips we re going to need a lot more than fifty well they re bewitched to hold up to three hundred documents each i assumed it would be enough considering that fifty times three hundred is well fifteen thousand documents and i doubt this room could hold more than ten thousand but that me he said arrogantly pleased with himself right then it ll do hermione figured that was enough of an apology considering she was pretty much sure he had never given an apology to anyone in his life he probably didnteven know what a real one sounded like anyway how should we organize things i was thinking by category or by date well if you actually look at the documents go on pick one up you see that they are labeled in the top right hand corner take these two for instance one says reverse death and this one here says growing therefore we should label a folder as reverse death and one as growing am i making any sense at all here to anyone but myself he asked and hermione rolled her eyes get over your own greatness she said and he shrugged would it kill you to admit i right every once in a while i assure you it would do wonders for my attitude towards you he said but his face betrayed realization i stand corrected except for the whole mudblood thing of course that i am afraid cannot be forgotten when i make your life hell draco commented dryly of course sir draco hermione conceded mockingly what did you say he asked and hermione smiled innocently nothing sir draco dontcall me that you little all right but honestly sir draco we must get to work she walked over to the corner humming and began to organize things and for the rest of their time in the room she called him nothing but sir draco and she had never seen him more pissed dontyou patronize me he would say and hermione would nod as if she understood i wouldntdo that sir draco and he start ranting all over again after four hours of bickering and fighting the room was looking much cleaner and now had a visible floor when their project began nearing completion hermione took it upon herself to assign sections to each of them draco ended up with organizing the folders he had brought and cleaning the floor a daunting task while hermione dusted candle holders washed the walls and gave the many portraits around the room a good scrubbing there we re done now right he asked hopefully taking a look around the room a smile of satisfaction on his face hermione shook her head and he sighed while crossing his arms over his chest what the hell could possibly be left to do he asked in his half exasperated half agitated tone the walls are spotless the floors are practically so shiny that i can see my reflection and have you even seen what we ve done with the documents i mean woman what more could you possible want i d first like you to look to your right and notice the large dead animal on the floor and then i would like you to look on the table and see how all of the blood stains and knife grooves accent the color of the wood she said and draco rolled his eyes there are worse things than dead animals and blood stains draco said caustically yes well dead animals tend to become an issue for me when they move and slowly prowl in the direction of a very bossy and very mean and bitter slytherin she said and she watched as she noted the seriousness in her tone and the look of fear in her eyes draco slowly turned to see a small creature glide towards him it was definitely not a boggart hermione concluded as there was no place to hide and it didntlook like anything she had ever seen before it eyes were a deep shade of red and it almost looked like it had no feet at all it just glided over the floor like a hovercraft oh my hermione shouted and draco nearly jumped out of his skin that a kelltor she said and she ran forward her arms spread wide hello little fellow she said and pulled out her wand as she knelt lumos she said and a thread of light burst forth from her wand the darkness dissipated and hermione cried out in glee draco it a real kelltor i ve only ever read about them and they re really rare she exclaimed and he nodded uninterestedly hey little fella what re you doing in hogwarts she asked it and the small animal sneezed spraying nasal fluid all over hermione face this made draco laugh which made hermione mad what do you think is so funny at least i donthave a dirt spot on my nose the size of a golf ball oh i sorry she said kindly as the animal yipped in fear i sorry aunty hermione wontyell at sir draco any more she held it close to her and draco rolled his eyes honestly you women and your damned animals draco said seriously you see a stray on the street and think it is the cutest thing ever hermione smiled as she held the small creature tightly in her arms hermione looked at the thing in her arms and noted its odd color as well as its seemingly unusual appearance it had the facial and skull structure of a very small dog but its hair hung off of it like a coat that was so low to the ground she could barely see any paws at all its coat was actually a common shade of auburn with light green scattered spots and at the end of its tail was a very white tip it glowed like unicorn hair hermione looked into its dark eyes and realized just how much she missed crookshanks but it is it so cute yes you she in said a high pitched and squeaky voice while patting its nose the creature rebuked by snipping at her fingers and she scoffed you ve poisoned the thing against me didnttake much draco retorted and the kelltor as if just realizing he was there turned its bright lamp like eyes towards him and he glared it pawed and struggled its way out of hermione arms and began walking towards him oh no you don t he said severely while brandishing his fist dontyou come any closer stay stay no get away but before he could throw even a punch at the dog like creature it was in draco arm licking his face well isntthis precious isntit just so lucky that i happen to have my camera draco hermione asked while walking towards her bag dontyou do it her hermione he stuttered and hermione nodded just one picture i ll leave you out of it i just want one of the kelltor my mum never seen the likes of it before that for sure she pulled out her camera and snapped a quick picture now get this hairy beast off of me he pleaded draco hermione began with a sigh just tell it what to do they are very good at taking commands we ll see when you re the one with the celtic beastie thing around your neck he said his voice raising in pitch as the kelltor began sniffing and licking his face and moved to his neck don t that tickles he shouted letting out a hearty laugh and hermione picked up her camera again this was one of those rare opportunities where risking your life to take a picture was necessary a flash engulfed the room and when hermione lowered her camera draco smile had faded and his face flushed you did not just take a photo draco demanded and hermione shrugged give me the goddamn camera you obviously cannot handle simple instructions he added give me the camera he took a step towards her and she shoved the camera into her bag damn it granger just give me the camera the kelltor looked uneasy and hermione was beginning to accept the seriousness of the situation i just took one o of the kelltor draco back off she yelled give me the fucking camera he said the kelltor jumped off his shoulder to the floor and hermione grabbed it come on let go she grabbed her bag and ran out of the room draco ranting following her all the way to the stairs hermione entered gryffindor tower and went to sit by the fire to inspect her new find it seemed docile enough to stay with her and there was no rule that she could had a kelltor as a pet i found you so i guess that makes you mine what kind of names do kelltors have she asked the small animal who cocked its head and gave a small weak and slightly saddening bark you look like a baby do you like the name baby she asked it and the kelltor growled what about aurum i like that but maybe for short i could call you auru hermione had a liking for odd names and auru definitely fulfilled her desire for something original aurum meant gold in latin and though he wasntexactly gold she looked like she d sure be worth a lot of it auru you like that the kelltor barked and hermione nodded i like it too now i want you to meet some people she soothed and hermione spent the whole rest of the evening introducing her new pet to all of her friends as hermione snuggled next to auru later that night she resolved that she would have her friend collin develop her pictures that she had taken in special wizard picture solution so that it would move draco may not have been pleased with the pictures but when hermione thought of them it brought a smile to her lips early saturday morning hermione woke to the sounds of loud harsh and altogether annoying screaming from the grounds she rose and closed her window but not before she took a quick glance to see whom was doing the killing but there was no one on the grounds it was then that she realized the yelling was coming from the corridor outside the gryffindor dorms she pulled her morning robe on and walked up the stairs into the gryffindor commons not surprisingly there was no one up at this hour but as she neared the portrait hole the yelling only grew louder hermione threw open the portrait hole door and stepped into the hallway but the yelling did not stop who out there she questioned quietly it was so dark that she could not see within a foot of her own face the yelling continued walking further down the hall she recognized the voices of two of her closest friends i was in the common room harry i know that you were leaving i just want to know where you were going is all ginny shouted if it is nearly as innocent as you re insinuating it is then i dontunderstand why you just wonttell me hermione moved forward to get a closer look at her friends who were off in the shadows somewhere near by ginny it not important where i was going you wouldntunderstand even if i did tell you said harry voice which seemed low and crushed the tones that they were using shocked hermione she could tell it was more the friendly anger and concern both of them cared about one another as was revealed from the way they spoke i just want to know that we re at that point that you can tell me these things even if they dontall make sense i not asking you to be flawless or perfect i asking you to be harry potter the honest harry i met and the harry i think i in love with hermione almost coughed out loud but covered her mouth in time there was silence and hermione was just about to turn around when she heard harry speak i love you too hermione bit her lip she had no idea why this came as such a surprise but that harry and ginny were together all she knew was that it did she watched harry step forward and take ginny into his arms it was like watching a movie except for the shock that it was real that harry was real and ginny was real turning hermione saw auru she had followed her all the way out into the hallway and she had been so quiet oh you re such a good girl she mouthed and took her into her arms let go to the library i not going to sleep anymore and i might as well get started she said and auru yipped in agreement and there is no rule about you accompanying me as long as you are potty trained and know the difference between an importantly ancient document and a chew toy after dressing hermione went down to the great hall for a quick and early breakfast which she enjoyed in complete solitude after eating three slices of toast a glass of pumpkin juice and three pieces of bacon hermione headed up to the library her very full animal friend right behind her entering the room the first thing that hermione noticed was a very calm and peaceful looking draco as she neared she realized that he must have been sleeping for the expression on his face was one of pure innocence something not even she had mastered walking further into the room she saw him lift his head groggily and look at her ah you re here he said disappointedly a look of disgust on his face and i see you ve brought the beast as well at least something good may come of your little visit his tired voice echoed through the cold empty room and for the first time hermione realized how cold it truly was you like auru then hermione asked and draco yawned rubbing his eyes who this auru he stood and stretched and hermione watched in avid jealousy as her new pet went scrambling towards draco that what i named her hermione replied in her know it all tone of voice that everyone in hogwarts knew a little too well for anyone liking not to ruin your pleasant dreams of kelltor puppies and all those feminine things that you women think of but auru here a boy he said arrogantly and hermione guffawed and how could you possibly know that hermione asked while crossing her arms over her chest indignantly well if you ve read up on kelltors then you would know that their color depends on gender the ordinary colors like brown and black and golden yellow are male colors and the odd ones like blue green and purple are female colors he retorted calmly as you see auru here is auburn and white with a little bit of green spray paint on his back end draco said with a smirk i dontsee why i should believe a word you say you re a liar and you re a slytherin each alone may be acceptable qualities but when grouped together the unfortunate person who inherits them is hopeless hermione said look for yourself draco said simply the kelltor scratched at his leg sadly and draco lifted him up onto the table there you are one of the decipherers eh he scratched the animal head and its reaction was cuter than anything hermione had seen yet it stuck its tongue out playfully and kicked out its leg in pleasure so how long have you been here hermione asked suddenly as she took a seat at the opposite end of the table dontask donttell it a healthy motto to base your life upon granger and the sooner you learn to abide by it the safer you will be draco said sadly right and they did not speak another word to one another unless it was to say pass the ink bottle or trace paper i suppose he ll be leaving with you hermione asked as she organized and put away her translation for lunch no the slytherins will tear auru apart draco shooed the small animal towards hermione and she left draco in the room alone to brood hermione passed the next few months by doing her best in school working hard when she was in arithmancy and spending all of her free time in the library ron was jealous of where all her time was directed and she could tell he was becoming suspicious of her motives which was silly wasntit not to say she enjoyed draco company more like she found it slightly tolerable because it was low maintenance she had also come to notice that everything that went on in the room every discovery made made draco a little more kind towards her and to a degree she liked that halloween had come and gone and everyone had been very disappointed when the teachers announced that there was no ball but when word spread that there was to be a yule ball similar to the one held in fourth year hogwarts went into a frenzy of hormones and a viciousness that hermione had never before witnessed girls were asking boys and boys were asking girls and love was everywhere by now ron had discovered harry and ginny relationship even though ron loved his sister and was very loyal to harry for some reason unknown to hermione he was unwilling to accept it during those long days of conflict hermione liked to spend her time in a much more controlled environment with a certain sleazy slytherin chapter 14 a mutual acceptance of terms draco noticed a slow change in everything in his world since he had denounced his heirloom he had not asked for the burden that was the malfoy name nor did he believe that he had any reason to stay loyal to it to be a malfoy meant to be doomed and with this realization came the eye opening revelation that not everything stood as it formerly had take the mudblood for example she seemed normal enough on the outside but in her veins ran the mixed blood of a wizard and a muggle what was in this blood that made it any different from his own a simple idea a simple belief a simple cycle of discrimination if he had met her on the street somewhere far from england draco had no doubt that he would have found granger attractive for both her appearance and her intellect upon further inspection of his entire life draco concluded that the hole after hole he found meant so much more than the idea on the whole some things just did not match up and for that reason he adopted a new philosophy not that he would change his personality though others may not have been draco was quite fond of his personality it was harsh it was dark but it was real and it was who he had become after sixteen years of draco in the making after the weeks and weeks he had spent in the room draco had come to a startling conclusion about the works of xander they had been tampered with after some advanced dating spells he had discovered that the documents had been opened changed and resealed in the recent past possibly within fifty years whatever the things xander had been working on someone had not wanted them read properly maybe not even read at all can you pass me the latin dictionary asked his constant companion and draco shook his head with a smirk no what the word he asked just as he always did she had insisted upon having the dictionary in the room but that didntmean he had to let her use it when he was there come on i know the rough translation of the word but i want to make sure it doesntmake any sense the mudblood looked up from her work a demanding expression on her face okay pass it here he said i here for a reason you know i know more latin than that stupid book he said bitterly dontyou trust me she guffawed and pushed her paper across the table towards him as she stood trust is something that is mutual draco is it my fault my father told me to never turn your back on a gryffindor he asked as he looked over the parchment is it my fault mcgonagall said the same thing about slytherins she asked and he looked up at her with an odd expression there you see she said pointing at the parchment how did you get this he asked seriously and she shrugged you ve translated this incorrectly you see two in this sequence stands for s not d therefore it would turn out to be dead not seas there he changed it and granger laughed always first to cast the stone she said and draco shook his head who said anything about stones you made a simple miscalculation it not like i jumped you for it he said severely as he handed it back to her that is exactly what you would have done before granger offered half jokingly and draco realized she was asking for reassurance on where they currently stood she needed to be sure that this would not all change in a day it couldn t he realized after being this way he knew there was no returning when we re in here we re colleagues granger draco said and this would have to be enough for her at this point so if it is dead then it still doesntmake sense she said and draco sighed how so he asked and she offered it to him read it he said draco was tired of reading the endless code of numbers his head hurt singularis conquiro alica ut servo vomica de certus nex absentia single sought spell to fight the curse of sure death does it make sense to you she asked and draco shrugged all those arithmancists were very weird who knows draco asked and she sighed read me more maybe that just a piece of the puzzle he suggested and she nodded half heartedly solus alica vis per vires satis pugno ut viridis addo de nex she read aloud slowly i dontknow what half those words mean she exclaimed i got only force and green and death she said looking over the paper at him and draco translated it slowly in his mind the only force with strength enough to fight the green bringer of death suddenly it struck him this fellow was trying to fight the curse of green death what the only killing spell you know described as green he asked granger and she shrugged avada kedavra he shouted and granger eyes went wide with horror you dontthink she asked and he shook his head i know it all makes sense he jumped up and she handed him the paper before he could tear it from her grasp he looked down at the paper he started going through all of the files they had already translated and stacked them in front of him in an almost wild frenzy it was all one experiment every document they had were xander attempts at creating a counter spell for the avada kedavra curse looking through each piece of parchment draco could have smacked himself now it makes sense he said with a sigh of relief and granger walked over next to him what makes sense she asked while looking over his shoulder as if she expected to see the same things he did that the documents were tampered with draco said without thinking tampered with how do you know that they were tampered with she asked and draco motioned for her to be silent for a minute after sitting and settling draco turned his attention to granger i found odd smudges on words and whole lines of numbers didntadd up correctly or even close so i had the ink dated and they were four hundred years apart in age he explained and she crossed her arms over her chest her posture suggesting that she wanted a good explanation for his silence i thought that someone had corrected his works but in reality they were sabotaging it do you know what this means draco asked and granger shook her head slowly no but i bet it has to do with power she commented dryly and draco ignored her it means that by completing the sequences ourselves we could find the counter spell for the killing curse aurors and wizards would be safe against voldemort favorite choice of weapon besides corruption and bribery that is he said and granger looked taken aback now that we know we just need to finish translating all of the documents get them organized recopy them without the words and sequences that were tampered with and then figure out what the hell it all means he said elatedly you think it will be that easy granger asked apparently unconvinced why not how wrong draco was when he asked that question two weeks into december draco found himself exhausted disappointed and angry all at once how could something seemingly so simple be so fucking complicated granger got the brunt of his frustrations though he often found himself snapping at her for no apparent reason and though he did not feel exactly guilty he did not feel all fuzzy on the inside he knew she was just as dedicated to the project but when he reached one more dead end that didntmatter on the day they discovered the aim of xander works they had decided to keep the discovery quiet they didnteven tell samuel not that they had had much of an opportunity as he was never there draco stood suddenly and shook his hands out giving a loud yawn he woke auru who in turn woke the granger groaning loudly she lifted her head and looked up at him what is it did you find something she asked and he shook his head i heading to bed he explained you should too he suggested and she nodded draco collected his things placed them in his bag and threw it over his shoulder see you tomorrow he said and granger nodded once again before laying her head back down he patted auru on the head as he passed and the small animal repositioned itself curling up next to the mudblood as draco made his way through the deserted dark and eerie hallways towards the prefectorial dormitories he heard an odd noise to his left turning he heard something that sounded disturbingly a lot like moaning veering off course a corridor draco followed the oddly strangled noise to a predictable source ah pansy draco said coolly at it again i see he finished with a knowing smirk there was rustling and a very flustered crabbe and a shameless pansy formed from the shadows oh crabbe nice choice in women we had more in common than i imagined pansy smirked if i still your type we could have a go she said slowly and draco resisted the urge to say something that could be interpreted as equally suggestive but a bit more violent tempting but no i would much rather have a go with myself than waste my time and energy on your high maintenance he replied and her grin never faltered i still donthave a date for the dance she was relentless i ve been waiting for you to come around but you re much more stubborn than you let on well it quite obvious you ve been around at least twice which is plenty for the both of us i ve decided draco retorted caustically and besides that i want something more than an arm decoration for the evening the slytherin common room has been lacking in intellectually stimulating conversation and i fear i may soon have to turn to the hufflepuffs i wontgive up that easily pansy said while taking crabbe hand in hers and leading him in the other direction remember my offer i ll be open until the night of the dance her voice faded and draco snorted i sure you re open more often than that draco eyes began coming in and out of focus and he shook his head drowsily he was so tired he walked to the wall trying to remember where he was and leaned against it slowly he slid down he would sit here just for a minute just until he figured out where he was and where he had been going draco eyes closed and he drifted off jolting awake only seconds later just to drift off once again he could feel the threat of sleep more acutely as black sweetness lurked near the edge of his vision just for a minute he convinced himself and he closed his eyes just for a minute mr malfoy what may i ask are you doing in the hallway asked a sharp voice and draco was jolted awake from his deep dreamless sleep professor draco exclaimed and he stood grabbing his bag sorry professor i must have dozed i dontremember stopping here sir he excused whether you remember or not makes no difference the fact that you are here is enough mr malfoy severus snape loomed over draco like a cloud ready to burst yes sir he said we need to have a talk mr malfoy he then said and draco sighed my office now i have work to do it saturday i am well aware of what day of the week it is mr malfoy now do as i say draco lifted his bag over his shoulder and followed snape to his office in the dungeons his head lowered heart filled with foreboding snape quickly unlocked the door to his private office and draco entered hesitantly taking a quick glance around there were many odd and disturbing things he noticed not only were there many jars of odd things suspended in yellow fluid but there were also other even weirder things hanging from his head of house ceiling have a seat mr malfoy the professor snapped and draco did as he was told taking the seat across snape desk now what is the matter with you he asked rather bluntly i received a letter from your mother telling me you have been aloof snape said and draco nodded i haventhad much spare time you see he explained casually she expects a twelve inch essay every day of the week and quite frankly i dontknow of one single student at this school who has that kind of extra time i see but that does not explain your change in attitude as well as a monumental change in your overall habits your grades are lacking as i see in most of your classes as of late they are very high but not the best quite an odd occurrence one might say yes mr malfoy snape searched his eyes and draco tried not to meet his princely black stare i have been preoccupied as i have already mentioned draco respectfully rebuked i assure you i have been giving no less of my attention to my schoolwork than i ever have and as you should know courses get harder as we move further into the year draco added transfiguration is a perfect example of this yes but you have never failed to rise to the occasion is the point snape replied darkly is there a problem i can help you with mr malfoy i am sure some of your frustration and your lack of concentration can be partly attributed to your current colleague snape slyly pointed out and draco nodded in sudden understanding we hardly see one another she developed a schedule within the first few days and i built my own around hers he lied through his teeth and snape smiled good to know that that is not what is contributing to your problem whatever it may be but that still leaves more unanswered questions snape leaned forward and folded his hands in front of him he looked suspicious but knew when to let things go as you know the malfoy fortune has been left in your name snape questioned and draco rolled his eyes i got the will just as you did draco said sharply and snape nodded a realizing spark in his eyes then you know you have certain responsibilities that you were formerly spared he asked and it was draco turn to nod good then i should not have to go into too much detail when i tell you to think with your mind not your heart nor other attributes teenage boys may feel the need to satiate snape said and draco felt a rush of heat come to his pale cheeks you have a family name to carry on and your mother has asked me to spare her this talk since she knows how you look up to me as a male figure in your life remember the value of blood draco especially your own snape stood and draco followed suit truly take into account all the things i have mentioned here he said while clapping draco on the shoulder yes sir he replied compliantly and snape smiled his dark eyes glittering out of his sallow pale lids snape leaned forward placing his full weight on his hands which were palms down on the surface of the desk now off to what you were doing before snape allowed but one would hope you were on the pitch watching the gryffindors get the stuffing beat out of them by the ravenclaw team snape said and draco froze as he saw the look of recall on his head of house face i neglected to ask for a report did you discover anything new with the veritaserum solution snape asked and draco smiled not as much as you would have expected snape frowned slightly and draco shrugged saying his goodbye then walked as quickly as he could towards to the library upon entering he saw to his disappointment that the room was empty the mudblood was probably on the quidditch pitch cheering on her friends draco thought with a sigh he set his bag carelessly down at the table all of the sudden feeling as if there wasntmuch incentive to stay in the room alone draco ran a hand through his bleach blond hair and let a deep calming breath pass between his lips deciding he would much prefer to take a shower then work right now he left his bag behind and walked slowly and purposefully to the prefectorial dormitory glumly saying the password draco entered the warmly lit large center room he didnteven take the time for a quick look around before swinging open the door into the slytherin dorm and walking straight to his dresser where he found a fresh set of clean clothes not his uniform he bundled everything carelessly into his arms and entered the conjoining bathroom after stepping into the glass doored stall draco showered slowly letting the water flow through his hair and over his body in endless torrents that soothed his every nerve unlike the slytherin showers in the normal dorms these were warmed automatically one did not have to turn the water on wait five minutes and take a quick shower that was often too warm or too cold think with your mind not your heart nor other attributes teenage boys may feel the need to satiate what gave snape the nerve to speak with him about such matters duties such as those were reserved for the father or immediate male family not one head of house and potions master and where would anyone get the idea that he had forgotten his duty to his name draco wondered perhaps crabbe had taken it upon himself to inform his mother of their little falling out or worse pansy had delivered her all star performance speech to someone else besides him and word had leaked to the homestretch and this was his mother way of warning him either way it was not good someone in hogwarts had taken on the role of a spy a spy that draco needed to seek out and destroy for if there was in deed some kind of observer than draco was at a great disadvantage leaning forward draco rested his head against the wall and savored the feeling of cool mingled with warmth as it spread in the form of a shiver throughout his body it had been a while since he could enjoy the soothing touch of water on flesh as well as being able to think things through properly without coming to an either incorrect or irrational conclusion after washing draco stepped from the shower and grabbed his silver towel off of the rack outside the shower door he walked slowly to the sink while thoroughly drying his hair then finished drying his clothes were a wrinkled mess on the counter and looking at them draco decided that some semblance of order needed to be displayed after all draco still had all the pride in the world in himself draco wrapped the towel securely around his waist and walked out of the bathroom fully intending to change when he was in the slytherin dorm but when draco entered the slytherin dorm and turned around he realized it was not the slytherin dorm at all this is un believable he had walked into the gryffindor dormitory and stood frozen in front of the door his clothes bundled in his arms only a towel wrapped around his waist the scene before him would have seemed hilariously funny had he not been involved draco decided granger was sitting comfortably on her couch her face red with agitation and weaselby his ears as red as his hair was standing over by her desk in his quidditch robes silently and with a smirk on his face draco reached behind him and turning the doorknob uttered a curse it was locked from the inside which suddenly made sense and draco could have laughed at his horribly bad luck calmly he let his hands fall back to his side and watching in mild discomfort as their personal argument continued he waited to be discovered ron you re not making any sense the granger snapped in a tone that draco often heard when she was addressing him you need to calm down donttell me i need to calm down why werentyou there he asked you always come to the first match of the season hermione we needed you and you were locked up in that stupid library with that stupid git like you always are weasley shouted and draco was slightly impressed but wondered how it made sense that he could shout like that at a woman but not another man ron i was asleep i forgot that the match was today i dontknow how many times i can apologize for something so stupid weasley face turned an even darker shade of red and he gripped his arm so tight that his knuckles turned white you forgot weasley stated in a cold and dangerous tone that could have been intimidating under other circumstances well he began what if i were to accidentally forget to ask you to the ball weasley asked and the mudblood had obviously heard enough get out and leave me alone until you can treat me with the respect i deserve granger said and weasley nodded my pleasure you know draco cringed as weaselby turned and stopped dead staring at draco hello draco said in voice that suggested he was much calmer than he actually was the mudblood head snapped around and draco gave her a short wave and an unperturbed smile i came to check out the view in here but it seems you donthave any windows either i ll be going draco secured his towel and began walking to the door no that fine i ll just leave you two here to sort things out weaselby said bitterly and walked out the door slamming it so hard behind him that the walls shook the gryffindor banner was knocked from the wall and floated gracefully to the floor in silence what his problem draco asked mockingly and granger glared at him it was an honest mistake granger talk to me when you re clothed granger snarled and draco let out a short laugh you know where the door is she reiterated and draco nodded i truly sorry i wasntpaying attention granted i should have been but i wasn t so i ll see you later then he said uncomfortably and she nodded draco left the room and walked into the prefectorial common room with a smile on his face he was pretty sure it would be a permanent thing over all he thought this was a very funny situation he didntunderstand why she was taking it so personally that weaselby character was a jackass to everyone why did she think she was any different because she had been until you the little voice in draco mind answered dontsee how it my fault he needs constant affirmation that he the only male at hogwarts she looks twice at draco muttered to himself angrily as he threw open the door to the slytherin prefect dorm and walked to his dresser after draco was dressed in normal school uniform he sighed loudly desperately opening the second drawer down he reached inside his fingertips blindly searching coarse parchment met his finger and draco retrieved the letter from the deep enchanted drawer the envelope was torn slightly in the corner but was otherwise untouched and draco could feel the small particles of sandy paper fall as he rubbed it idly with his thumb his father will draco completed opening the envelope and extracted the yellowing parchment from within he had lied to snape that morning he hadntread the will yet hadntbeen able to look at the neat curvy cursive that he had seen his father use to write out a certificate for someone death the same handwriting he had seen in ever letter he had ever received from home slowly unfolding the parchment draco felt his heart begin to pound behind his rib cage a feeling of grief settled in the very pit of his stomach and he began to read his father last will and testament i lucius malfoy being of sound and disposing mind and memory do make publish and declare the following to be my last will and testament hereby revoking all wills made by me at any time heretofore i nominate constitute and appoint my wife narcissa malena malfoy to be the sole executor and trustee of this my will if she is unable or unwilling to act i then nominate constitute and appoint my son draconis aquilus malfoy to be the sole executor of this my will i lucius malfoy give devise and bequest all of my property of every nature and kind and whatsoever situate including any property over which i may have a general power or appointment to my said trustee as draco read through the mundane details of the will he felt his stomach rise and anger coursed through him he wasntin it not once was his name mentioned other than as a mere formality the malfoy estate was not his but his mother s now draco understood the knowing expression snape had given him draco didnteven bother reading the rest of the document before crumpling it into his fist and throwing it as hard as he could across the room after years of enduring his father hell this is what he got nothing but trinkets and a mere namesake he had given his life to his father cause and he had nothing but draco supposed that was how it was supposed to work all along those who were innocent gave more but never got their gold worth in the end draco hit his dresser drawer closed with a fierce punch and cursed under his breath as he felt the tender skin of his knuckles split the envelope fell off the dresser and drifted grandly to the marble flooring upon its making contact with the hard floor draco noticed an additional piece of parchment housed within its confines bending down slowly draco took the envelope once again in his hands and peered inside sure enough there was another letter enclosed draco took out the single piece of lonely parchment and unfolded it gently the excitement of the last letter he thought had drained him but he was wrong he felt the rush of adrenaline through his body as he began to read dear draco son of mine how you have failed me cowardly and weak you have let me down you have let you mother down and you have let your blood down i wish you the only the most fortunate luck in your future endeavors and only hope you can overcome the shame you should feel without destroying yourself if only you had put half the amount of devotion you have for your schoolwork into what truly matters you would be spared his negative attentions beware of those who hate you but only those who love you and you love back can destroy you your father your superior lucius malfoy draco read and reread the letter several times before he actually accepted what it said his father had called him a coward fuck you he told the letter fuck you he shouted at the top of his lungs draco made sure that this letter met the same fate if not a worse one than the other one and left the slytherin dorms in a hurry he walked through the prefectorial commons to the gryffindor door and banged loudly three times granger opened the door a crack and upon seeing his face she sighed what do you need malfoy she asked and draco wondered what the hell he was doing i dontknow he exclaimed his voice filled with repressed anger i dontknow forget it he said and stormed off in the other direction wait she shouted after him and he heard her following draco slow down she begged but draco felt as though he had hell biting at his heels and he couldnt stop draco granger shouted as he exited the common room and began speeding through corridors he heard her stop and the sound of her voice faded draco spent the next three hours alone in the library poring over the documents brooding and as odd as it seemed even to him he wished that auru were there the little kelltor was very perceptive and knew how to comfort draco looked down at the parchment and focused on the sequence of numbers with an unwavering concentration so far they had only deciphered and had the key to fifty sequences which may have seemed like quite an accomplishment in the face of the project difficulty but to draco it was failure fifty out of five thousand was a speck on the map a grain of sand on a beach and they had a long ways to go yet filling in the blanks was the hardest part for draco because in order to fill it in properly one has to do a string of lengthy equations and even then it was a guess and check process that more often than not was wrong so into the documents draco was that he did not notice when the door opened and samuel walked in after a few minutes samuel gave a small cough and draco looked up annoyed yes draco questioned and samuel shrugged what are we doing he asked and draco rolled his eyes with a loud sigh right now we re trying to decipher xander complex codes he used a new one for ever spell he attempted to create which creates a pain in the neck for us draco explained we ve organized all of the documents into all their respective categories and all you have to do is choose one and dig in right where the granger girl samuel asked and draco shrugged well samuel began while clapping might as well have a go right but draco gave no reply he was already absorbed in his work again his focus however did not keep him from hearing the hufflepuff mutter something like overly dedicated under his breath which made draco smirk better than being under dedicated a half an hour into work draco heard the door open and close again and looked around samuel had left all of his documents he had been working on were scattered about his workspace and draco could have had a fit but before he could throw anything about granger entered her bag slung over her shoulder how long was samuel here asked granger in a quietly conscious voice that she had learned to use when he had been working for long periods of time half an hour he couldnthack it draco said with a bitter smirk neither can i but i wontgive up you are stubborn she stated while coming further into the room and setting her bag down on the table after grabbing her file from the shelf she took her seat across the table from draco and started working draco didntknow how long he worked straight but eventually he let his eyes take a break from the abuse of work he rubbed his eyes and laid his head down five minutes later he was ready to begin again looking across the table at granger he let a small smile tug at the corners of his mouth she was chewing nervously at her bottom lip and she subconsciously fingered the necklace around her neck a long strand of bushy brown hair fell in front of her face and she expelled it with a puff of air draco shook his head while looking back down at the yellowed parchment but he found himself unable to concentrate he felt like talking about what had happened he wanted to scream and rant that all he was worth to his father was a dagger a golden gilded bow and a ring encrusted with the malfoy emblem but as always he kept to himself and as always he felt the emotion eat away at his composure until the mudblood noticed is something wrong she asked and draco was jolted from his thoughts no why he asked suspiciously and granger shrugged you were holding your quill so tight that i feared you were going to snap it in half and burst the ink all over your translations she said and he set his quill idly down on the desk as if it were the enemy wouldntmatter much would it i not much farther than i was yesterday he exclaimed and granger shook her head we re getting somewhere draco and you have to be happy with that she preached contentedly well i not he rebuked childishly that your deal then granger said while looking back to her translations if you cannot see that what we re doing here is taking baby steps in the right direction then why are you still here why are you still working so late into the night that when you leave you go straight to classes why are you the way she said it seemed to draco more like a challenge than a question or anything else because you are he said and granger laughed because draco malfoy cannot let me a mudblood do anything that may make the substance of my blood or lack thereof meaningless she said coldly and draco realized that was just it not as honorable a reason as you would make it seem i never claimed to be a gryffindor did i it was a rhetorical question and granger knew it so she kept quiet in a half an hour this argument would be forgotten and they both would be on less but still bitter speaking terms no no you didn t she said and draco went back to work what couldnthave been ten minutes later samuel walked into the room hello there he greeted cheerfully dontyou two look like the two gloomiest people there ever was granger you should be celebrating the gryffindors won because of your friend potter though i suspect that nothing new granger gave a curt nod and samuel went silent he walked to his desk and took his seat something draco noticed about samuel that annoyed him to no end was that he didnthave the slightest capacity to shut up silence was just something that was unacceptable when samuel was in the room with them knowing this beforehand draco set his quill down and waited you two have dates for the dance he asked and draco smirked granger looked up a slightly annoyed expression on her face i going with hannah abbot do you know her i think she in your year eh he asked and granger nodded yes i know hannah she a sweet girl she a hufflepuff though we dontreally see a lot of one another you know samuel nodded well he prompted who are you two going with both of you must have dates by now samuel stated knowingly a wide smirk on his angular face the dance is in what four days i donthave a proper date yet but once ron cools down i think we ll be going together granger said and draco coughed inwardly he thought that had been over months before and either weaselby was incapable of letting go or granger was settling to go with someone familiar since that krum guy wasntthere really now ron weasley you say samuel asked a curious expression stretching across his face granger nodded with an odd expression of her own you see that quite impossible as ron going with a friend of mine you heard of amber solitaire he asked granger nodded dumbly and draco suddenly felt very sympathetic yes i know who amber is we re friendly acquaintances when was this arrangement made she asked and samuel looked uncomfortable earlier today all i know about the whole affair is that he was storming through halls she said hi they talked and he asked her he said he didnthave a date and she thought he was cute so there it is draco would have laughed if the situation had been the other way around with weasley being the one played but it wasntand though she was good at hiding it draco could tell that she was very hurt i see she said shortly well i wish amber the best of luck with him granger stood slowly and draco saw the traces of tears behind her brown eyes as she packed her folder away and put all of her stuff into her bag she turned to leave and draco stood want to go for a walk he asked and she looked up at him her eyes searching for the answer to the question he was asking himself no i ll be fine thank you for your concern have fun with your documents she stated with an air of finality i have some schoolwork i need to complete i wouldnthave been here very long anyways draco nodded and sat down watching her leave head down and book bag slung despondently over her left shoulder draco looked down at his parchment and sighed loudly fancy her do you samuel asked and draco rolled his eyes no but i care when she this upset granger doesntconcentrate well when she and weaselby have an argument and this shit that he pulling i have a feeling is going to set us back an entire week if not two he said quickly and samuel nodded after two more minutes draco decided he had had enough fo this for now standing he bade samuel farewell and followed after granger walking through the winding corridors draco sauntered to the prefectorial dormitories where he assumed correctly granger would have made her way to he heard her voice even before he had said the password but it was not her normal voice nor was it her normal tone as he entered the large common space he saw something zoom towards his face and ducked just in time to avoid a fireplace ornament aimed to behead him looking around for the source of the projectile draco saw granger over by the fireplace another ornament in her hand wait come on now granger let think about this logically he soothed but granger grip only tightened what good would it do for you to bludgeon me when the one you really want to beat to death is weaselby he asked i would be freeing the world of one more sleazy boy she shouted granger hesitated only a second before letting the porcelain statuette lose towards his face with as much force behind her arm as she possessed he ducked once more and she crossed her arms over her chest brooding as if she were disappointed she had a crazed look in her eyes that same look that his mother often had after her and his father had gotten into a fight and punches were thrown suddenly draco would do anything to make it stop to make that wounded look in her eyes disappear we could go together draco suggested rather halfheartedly i i donthave a date and pansy been all over me for the past three weeks i dontwant to go alone and i sure you dontwant to go alone either and weasel dumped you for some ravenclaw he paused for a second to gauge her reaction to his proposition and granger lifted another statuette from the ledge no no no it all makes perfect sense you see i a prefect you re a prefect and well we could call it a a mutual acceptance of terms right i supposed to take what you say seriously when i have something heavy and slightly lethal ready to throw at your head she asked and draco nodded vehemently why wouldntit risk your image she asked her voice full of suspicion i have no image draco said and the way he said it made her set the small object of death back down in its rightful place so he questioned and granger shrugged so her shoulders drooped in indignation do i have a choice she asked and it was draco turn to be hurt of course you do go alone if you want it your image you should be worried about i cantwait to see the look on weasley face when he sees you enter alone and in the same state you re in now draco was using reverse psychology and despite the fact that he knew it was dangerous he also knew it would work which would be worse that look of triumph when you enter alone or that look of shock and jealousy when you enter on the arm of a slytherin prince i dontwant to go to make him jealous i want to go to have a good time or in the least to have done all that work to see a good event she said sadly while shaking her head then a good time we shall have i thought you and i got along fine draco said slowly two people who spill their blood into something together for so long and so viciously should be able to attend an event together without there being anything to worry about image wise i suppose you have a point mr malfoy granger conceded with a small grin but the question of the matter would be could you handle me a whole night without being vicious she asked and draco shrugged can you granger cracked a full smile and he took a step forward is this a deal then i suppose so mr malfoy what did you call this a mutual acceptance of terms draco nodded i do believe you have a date you as well miss granger you know as much as i love my surname i getting tired of being called granger you have officially worn it out she stated bluntly does that mean i have to call you by your christian name draco asked fearfully and granger nodded so i have to call you hermo ninny he mocked and granger brandished the statuette in his direction once again all right i suppose hermione isntthe worst name one could ever have been given do you think samuel still in the library hermione asked and draco shook his head with no one to talk to honestly i thought you had caught on gr hermione hermione gave him the quick thumbs up sign and he coughed loudly good maybe we can actually get some work done i dontknow about you but i feel suddenly enthused she said and draco shrugged could it be you re imagining the look on weaselby face when he sees you with me he asked and she considered it that may just be it there was silence all the way to the library but it was the kind of silence where it would be wrong to break it a silence of acceptance that had never before been felt between a slytherin and a gryffindor when they entered they discovered that draco had been right once again samuel was nowhere to be seen and once again all of his stuff was scattered throughout his workspace something that drove draco insane sitting down in their respective places draco threw hermione a quick glance which she returned something had definitely changed and for just a moment draco felt the tightness in his stomach that was almost always present release and subside after a few minutes of focus hermione broke the silence do you think this curse was as popular then as it is now she asked and draco looked up probably he replied shortly do you think there were men like voldemort around she added thoughtfully draco shook his head slowly no seriously yes i do men like voldemort are always around and they always have people like death eaters to support them it a cycle that is inevitable for some and others have the resources to avoid it draco said while looking away i dontunderstand how it can be inevitable she spoke with a hint of disgust in her voice and draco gave her a smile that was real but weak you wouldn t he stated darkly hermione suddenly reached across the table and grabbed draco left arm before he could react she had pushed his sleeve up to his elbow and inspected his forearm only to find it pale and untouched except for a series of small scars a reminder of a painful past draco knew what she had been looking for and pulled away angrily what the hell your problem he exclaimed shaking his sleeve into its former more comfortable and concealing position hermione looked him in they eye a look of pleasant surprise on her face i needed to see i could stand going to the ball with a slytherin but not a death eater she said and draco nodded his anger had not yet dissipated and he was feeling a lot less than friendly towards the little gryffindor prefect well miss granger i can guarantee to you that you will never see that mark on my arm he said coldly and hermione nodded nobly draco could tell that she was not in the least embarrassed about their short yet seemingly intimate contact which made what he was feeling much worse for him let hope not she said bluntly and they both went back to work without saying another word a n sorry this chapter is so short and it a little late my cat died this weekend and i just thought it should be known that in all my fifteen years and some odd months i have never lived a day without seeing her i will still keep updating regularly but forgive me if my entries start to get all dark and depressed i am very sad that she is gone and some of that may rub off in my writing so i apologize beforehand thanks to all of you loyal reviewers i appreciate every single word you write to me chapter 15 the boggart draco real fear sitting in the room alone with granger after the whole event seemed to draco like it would be awkward but surprisingly enough it was just as it had always been possibly better they had even had a small argument draco had automatically incorrectly as granger pointed out so kindly that she would of course attune to his choice in theme as far as the colors they would wear went he had kindly but seriously told her that he would be dressing as slytherin as slytherin could be and she had politely rebuked that she would match him by dressing as gryffindor as gryffindor could be quite the chaotic spectacle they would make the two of them under the pretense that granger would dress how she willed draco wasntabout to go out of his way to make himself presentable but some innate pride he had in himself would not allow him to underdress for the occasion either so draco sent his mother an owl asking for three hundred galleons enough to buy anything he would need for the dance and more a day later he had three hundred and seventy five galleons for spending his mother always sent extra just in case anything else came up this week it just so happened snape was freely passing out undeserved passes to enter the wizarding town of hogsmeade during the course of the school days before the ball to slytherins as it turned out samuel was not as well informed as he had led them all to believe for the ball was in fact the wednesday of the following week not the upcoming wednesday draco shouldnti go with you so that we can match our ball wear asked pansy from behind and draco shook his head finally my own sweet revenge i going with someone else we ve already settled all the details draco said and pansy smirked as if she knew something he didn t who would this date be do i know her she asked and draco once again shook his head she a slytherin no doubt pansy searched his face which he kept emotionless and void of implications of any sort she not right you are he said joyously feeling a small bounce in his step begin to form who her composure was failing and draco reveled in the half hurt and half bitterly inquisitive look i remember playing a familiar game with you draco said i sure you can guess the answer no well it starts with a g and ends with an uess he finished and pansy let out a short forced laugh we ll see word of traitors travels fast pansy said he voice filled with disgust it a good thing we ve both agreed not to whisper a word then eh he asked and she stomped her foot i will get you draconis one way or another i will have you and no matter how many other girls you fuck along the way know this your path will always intercede with mine whether it is with your will or against it pansy said and she turned on her heel and walked away head held high and that where you re wrong he said to himself at the time draco was missing charms with the hufflepuffs so he had to hurry he had dada class next and he could not afford to miss even one class things had really picked up and alias seemed intent on moving as fast as possible without throwing every student in the class off whereas charms was moving at the same slow and easy going pace it had began at walking down the long dirt road to the village of hogsmeade draco wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck to block the cold that was currently sending shivers up his spine that were sharp and almost painful in their intensity five minutes into the walk a cobblestone road appeared and all he had to do was follow it at his own set pace which he decided would be brisk the conditions outside were worsening and he would not have been surprised had it started snowing within the next couple of days maybe hours entering the perimeter of the town the dead ruins he had come upon sprang to life in vivid detail the once silent air rang with so many voices that draco was following at least twelve different conversations at once but when his ears and nose finally adapted to the sudden onslaught of culture draco felt himself ease walking through the crowded seemingly tiny street draco craned his neck to gaze at all the different shops and finally came across one worthy of his time tyler formal dress shop eh draco read out loud and he walked into the shop his moneybag gripped loosely in his pocket the door opened with a loud magical ring and draco almost jumped may i help you good sir asked a male voice from across the room and draco turned to face it i have a very formal school function approaching and i need something suitable he said and the man nodded you have indeed come to the right place we have everything one could need for such occasions here he said while walking out from behind the counter let hope draco said darkly i have a class to attend in an hour and forty five minutes and i cannot afford to tarry i see well we donthave much time so let us get started eh the man asked and draco noted his apparently effeminate walk and grace that would be nice do you have a specific price range you are looking for the man asked and draco decided to fib wasting money wouldnthurt considering but that didntmean he should if he didnthave to i was thinking between one hundred and two hundred galleons he said and the man nodded you have definitely come to the right place do you attend hogwarts he asked and draco gave a curt nod as he looked around the small yet well filled store i have a daughter going there we re very proud what year are you sixth i a prefect draco replied oh well you probably dontknow my little girl sarah then she a second year what house are you in the man asked while giving him a thorough overview slytherin i willing to bet draco nodded was there anything you had in mind specifically yes i am looking for an attractive combination of silver black and green not those fake and faded bright colors either i want a nice dark jade and a true black and well silver is silver the man nodded let have a look shall we draco followed the nervous man around the store to rack after rack until both their arms were filled with vests of every cloth imaginable trousers of every style and undershirts of all different design try this combination the man jeff said while holding out a set of clothes draco took the clothes and walked to the dressing room which smelled oddly of perfume five minutes later draco emerged from the dressing room no no try this one draco nodded and walked back into the dressing room something that happened many times before they finally settled on an outfit draco paid the man one hundred and fifty galleons for the clothing and jeff told him to retrieve it the day after next when he would surely have had it fitted and ready for draco to wear thank you jeff said with a short wave and a wink and draco waved back as he exited the small store thanks to jeff efficient and professional work draco still had a little less than an hour to wander aimlessly and waste him money on small useless trinkets before he reached the end of the road draco was drawn into a quidditch supply store where he bought new enchanted broom grips and a higher quality of shin guards after buying what he wanted from every other store that caught his attention he decided that is was time to head back the other way near the entrance to hogsmeade draco saw something in the window of a store that captivated him it was a small delicate necklace he neared the window to get a better look it was a thin golden chain and the pendant at its apex could not be overlooked the stone he now recognized as mood stone was polished so well that he could see himself it was a real mood necklace draco considered not like those cheap one muggles sold the real stone was cut from the same stone that crystal balls were but they were soaked in a magic sort of vinegar that brought the stone to life from the core and sensitized it it detected small changes in voice fluctuations and heat and projected certain colors of significant meaning to the surface of the stone draco still holding one hundred fifty galleons in his pocket entered the small store and purchased the necklace surprisingly it only cost ninety four which left him with only fifty six galleons still more than weaselby ever seen in his entire life draco bet maliciously he was feeling more vicious towards weasley at the moment than he had ever in fact felt during their previous five years at hogwarts as draco was walking back to the castle he was suffering from the normal buyer regret but the odd thing was he felt guilty about buying the grips and shin guards and the small replica sword of aragorn but not the necklace reaching the front doors draco decided he would give the necklace to hermione to wear since she probably didnthave any decent jewelry of her own and he had one necklace that he would never wear but how to give it to her without her knowing it was from him what better idea was there but to leave it hidden within some niche in the library for her to find so that was exactly what he did as he was hiding it the bell rang releasing them all to go to their next class and draco did so an odd feeling of elation clouding his mind entering the dada classroom draco took his normal seat in the front row since he no longer had crabbe and goyle to socialize with he had a lot more room for guests at his lonely table right before the last bell rang three flustered gryffindors entered the classroom weaselby and potty walked straight to the back without one look back and hermione took the empty seat next to draco a sigh of anger and frustration expelled from her lungs good afternoon class said dark in her falsely sweet voice as she swooped in from the doorway and walked to the front and center of the classroom i have a special lesson planned for today and since it is the last day before we all leave on holiday i expect you ll all want to choose your own partners there were many out callings of glee and happiness from every corner of the room and a silent excitement settled over everyone the ball was coming up soon settle down she said settle down now the class loudness slowly tapered until it was only a whisper here and a whisper there good pull out your books and turn to page three twenty five today we will be learning about xander draco heard hermione utter reverently under her breath i never stopped to think maybe he was a dark wizard i never even thought to look him up she exclaimed and dark stopped talking glaring in their direction perhaps you two would like to take your conversation outside of my classroom mr malfoy i expected better from you she said and draco for the life of him could not understand why was xander an evil wizard hermione asked and dark looked taken aback at granger nonchalant snub of her sharp chastisement whomsoever decided the exact definition of evil would have to answer that but since no one has as of yet thought themselves worthy of such categorizing we shall assume evil means bad there were snickers around the class and draco hushed them all rather loudly was xander a bad wizard no dark said sharply then why are we learning about him in defense against the dark arts hermione question and dark smiled the first good question you have asked in a while granger dark said turning on an old fashioned film projector she turned off the lights with a flick of her wand as some of you already know xander was a famous alchemist as well as an avid arithmancist his works varied so greatly that we are still sifting through documents to give him credit for work formerly accredited to other wizards of his time dark explained quietly there was a click and an image of a very hairy bushy looking man appeared on the chalkboard this is said to be an accurate portrait of xander he was compared mostly to a kind of human mole he lived underground ate vegetables and bread had no contact with the outside world and seemed to have a general disliking of the human race not shocking draco muttered some even think he may have been a vampire or a werewolf but those are just the sorts of legends to pop up around a man of such genius beyond those childish superstitions comes the fact that xander was the very first wizard to attempt creating a counter spell for the killing curse the class went suddenly quiet and dark looked hard around the room the projector clicked and the portrait of xander was replaced by one of a beautiful smiling woman and a small child xander family a wife and a son was murdered on the eve of his greatest discovery by a jealous wizard by the name of treadle hurt who used none other than the killing curse which is why xander began his research draco was listening intently and he could sense the same extreme concentration from hermione xander spent the last fifty nine years of his life trying to create a counter spell in fact xander died in our very own school according to historical documents she said while looking specifically at him and hermione two of our very own students are working to discover the mysteries hidden in xander works have you found anything at all she asked and draco elected to answer so far we have just begun deciphering his language as you mentioned he was an amazing arithmancist and knew his codes and how to make them unreadable we are making headway to be sure but at a very slow pace he said slowly and dark nodded now i would like you all for our last day of class to spend the rest of this period creating a code that you think will be unbreakable then over holiday our two very own arithmancists will decipher them and grade you on how well you did dark said and there were murmurs of excitement now since we do not want biased grades i will make sure malfoy and granger are both given random papers get to work miss granger mr malfoy may i speak with you for a moment both draco and hermione stood hermione seemed a bit irked and it wasntlike draco could blame her they had both been volunteered for something that would no doubt take hours from their holiday that could be spent breaking real codes that meant something following dark into her private office draco threw hermione a questioning glance and she shrugged she had no idea what they were in for and there was no way they could have prepared themselves for what they saw you two have your own special assignment over break dark said while proudly pointing at a gigantic christmas tree i cannot for the life of me expel this boggart from the christmas tree and i heard you both had extensive practice with boggarts in your third year it needs to be boggart free by the yule ball and well i sure it wouldnthurt for you to decorate it that it draco asked and dark nodded a boggart as simple as it seems to you mr malfoy i would like you to remember and respect that i have over twenty more years of experience and i myself could not get rid of the thing dark said reprovingly all right why didntyou ask another teacher hermione asked while crossing her arms over her chest like him he could tell that she assumed there was something more to this than dark was letting them in on and it was a bit unnerving they re all so busy and this tree is a special surprise in tribute to your former headmaster whom i was led to believe left last year dark said lacking the confidence needed behind such a statement to make it sound even the slightest bit sincere yes professor dumbledore left hermione said sadly and dark nodded i never met him but from what i often hear from all the people he touched that he was a great headmaster dark said and draco scoffed is a great headmaster hermione snapped defensively as far as i am concerned he is still our headmaster the only reason he is still deposed is because the ministry refused to accept that voldemort was back until it was too late and now he in hiding because of some fanatic death eater who threatened his life over the summer and everyone knew he was too valuable to the cause to lose draco looked to hermione who was obviously very passionate about whom she spoke of and she stared back her eyes glittering with sadness and rage she was insane she was intense she was over reacting but she was beautiful just then i was told quite a different tale miss granger and though you think you know what is going on beyond the walls of your comfortable school your little mind cannot fathom what is going on as we speak dark said dangerously dumbledore was sent away from this school in shame and no matter how vehemently you defend him it will not change the simple fact that he sacrificed so many to protect himself that is not true hermione shouted taking a step forward and tightening her fists menacingly draco had never seen her so furious and he felt the need to intervene but held steady his ground you are dismissed back to class now go hermione did not move and draco was not about to leave her behind take it back she demanded but dark was unresponsive i was there i saw the angry the frustrated and the hurt look on his face hermione said her voice cracking when harry cried i would bet my wages for the rest of my life that dumbledore did as well come on hermione draco said his voice serious but soothing all at once but the girl refused to move i would suggest you do as mr malfoy says lest you wish to find yourself as well as him in the true headmaster office hermione went rigid and draco braced himself for the worst a half an hour later draco and hermione were sitting in front of dumbledore in hogsmeade hermione seemed pleasantly unsurprised whereas draco had what he was sure was a permanent look of shock plastered to his face explain please miss granger why you are once again in my presence this time for fighting with a teacher once again alias dark called you a coward and made it a point to tell me i didntknow you as much as i thought i did hermione replied and dumbledore cracked a grin in her general direction you dontmiss granger why are you so confident that i am not a coward he asked in a half amused voice that draco admired because sir you have put your life at risk for all of us on more than one occasion and we have no reason to distrust you in the slightest dark made it seemed like you were voldemort in blue robes and a smile ah miss dark our newest addition to the school staff i assure you she was not my first choice and it was very out of line for her to share her opinions with you but in the same respect miss granger i admire your willingness to defend me but she is a teacher and you are a student you should not have voiced your opinion to her unless you were willing to listen to her side just as avidly dumbledore said and draco huffed under his breath mr malfoy dumbledore began with a tone of severity rarely heard why are you here i wasntabout to leave her granger alone in there with dark i positive one of them would have ended up limb less or something of the sort he replied in a cool calm and collected voice i see that was a very chivalrous thing to do dumbledore said and draco jeered mentally while letting out a quiet guffaw you disagree i did what was right to me it not like i saved a village of small defenseless chickens from a raging fire with one hand tied behind my back and my eyes closed he retorted with a serious expression on his face what i did was no more chivalrous than you picking your teeth with a toothpick mr malfoy that is enough disrespect said the severe voice of mcgonagall from the corner and draco inwardly sighed he had forgotten she was here she idolized dumbledore like he was god or something of the likes no minerva draco has a right to his own opinion whether they are wrong to us or right to us rude or disrespectful that is his opinion he is blatantly mocking you albus mcgonagall interrupted angrily and he will learn from his mistakes at some other point in time now is not the time nor the place to be teaching a misled youth morals now is the time for investigation dumbledore turned to hermione you know that what you did cannot go unpunished correct he asked and hermione nodded slowly a sad and distraught look on her face i will write a letter that mcgonagall will give to our replacement headmaster saying you are dismissed from dark classroom for three days one day for mr malfoy every assignment you miss will be made up cordially and you will show respect to the staff at hogwarts whether it be dark or mr filch every witch and wizard at that school has earned his or her place and it is not a student job to question dumbledore gave them each a hard look and draco returned it with a look of his own that looked just as serious from his cold gray eyes let go you two mcgonagall said and dumbledore shook his head no no wait there is always time for a butter beer minerva go ask madame rosmerta to be a dear and bring us some drinks fire whiskey for me please dumbledore said and draco grinned fire whiskey it looked like one of those would do the old man in you re sick albus why donti bring you a nice pepper up potion instead no how about a butter beer dumbledore gave her a severe look that seemed specially modified just for her and she shrugged fine it your throat not mine and she left to make their order draco reached into his pocket for his moneybag but dumbledore reached across the table and touched draco hand making him tense no need the drinks are on me mr malfoy after all you both are here by my summons draco nodded and only when dumbledore pulled his hand away did he relax so how are preparations for the yule ball going are you prefects working hard he asked and both draco and hermione nodded we have all had to learn a few new spells through it all hermione said comfortably how she could talk to a man of such power in such a casual voice made him extremely uneasy but draco and i have had much more to do considering she said and draco almost jumped she had called him draco in front of the old coot is that right what are you and mr malfoy doing dumbledore asked and draco decided the question was directed at him well miss granger and i have been assigned a special arithmancy project due to our aptitude and ability to get things done and done well they discovered a new chamber in the library filled with ancient documents containing hundreds of spells codes actually and we have been hired to decipher them for proper documentation draco said and dumbledore seemed genuinely intrigued the author he asked xander hermione piped in intriguing i suppose you know all about him then he was killed in hogwarts you know dumbledore said and draco leaned forward killed we were led to believe that he died of old age draco said and dumbledore eyebrows registered slight surprise i am sure you have discovered his mess on the table by now dumbledore asked and both of them nodded he was killed stabbed to death if i remember correctly dumbledore explained you were alive draco exclaimed and dumbledore let out a hearty laugh that turned into a hacking cough dear me no he said after he had regained his weak but steady composure we have everything that ever happened on hogwarts property filed the headmaster of the time left detailed notes as to how he was found so you knew where the chamber was hermione asked and dumbledore nodded why didntyou ever tell anyone she questioned dumbly no one ever asked i didntthink it needed to be brought to anyone immediate attention without purpose he said shortly and hermione got the clue that he had other reasons that were not to be discussed here and certainly not with them how much progress have you made dumbledore asked notably changing the subject so far draco asked and the old man nodded not all of the sudden the door opened and mcgonagall walked in two drinks in her hands followed by madame rosmerta who was holding two as well i wontallow you to drink a fire whiskey headmaster rosmerta said kindly but seriously not with your health bein in the state it currently in now you drink this and get plenty of rest no more of this island hopping i ve heard so much about you re not as young as you used to be sir and this isnta vacation hermione smiled at the childishly brooding expression on the headmaster face at receiving a pepper up potion instead of his fire whiskey minerva he said and mcgonagall threw up her hands claiming innocence right my ears will be steaming for hours he tossed back the disgusting concoction and madame rosmerta left the room satisfied after they had finished their drinks they were led back to the castle without even finishing their conversation classes were over for the day and draco was exhausted and went straight to the prefectorial dormitories he didnteven say goodbye to hermione the annoying buzz of draco alarm clock woke him in midmorning on the twenty fourth he rose slowly from his bed and folded his comforter over neatly he usually did not displace the covers at all but last night had been full of nightmares and odd dreams which caused him to stir restlessly in his sleep standing draco let out a loud monstrous yawn and scratched his chest lightly with a smile he recalled the events of the night before hermione samuel and him had all been working overtime the night before the ball samuel had been talking when samuel decided to put his folder away but as he was walking along the wall he noticed a small niche with an elegant necklace hidden in its depths wow he exclaimed happily look at this piece of work he said turning around and displaying his find draco had literally choked on his tongue hannah will love it you cantgive it to her draco quickly said and both hermione and samuel looked in his direction why the bloody hell not samuel asked while fingering the piece possessively a suspicious glare that did not fit his facial structure at all on his face because well because it mine draco stuttered and samuel wagged his finger at draco no it not i ve just found it you you just want it for yourself he said and draco sighed samuel obviously wanted to play this the hard way no way was draco going to lose ninety four galleons to pride so unless you want me to rearrange your face for the ball i suggest you take that as a good enough answer draco warned and samuel opened his mouth to speak but closed it again that what i thought now hand it on over samuel grasped it tighter but it seemed to draco as if his face meant more to him than a pretty trinket on a string of gold pay me he said and draco laughed out loud a smirk on his handsomely dark face yeah right draco said pay me or it goes to hannah i not afraid of you draco glared and folded his arms across his chest see that a problem that we can deal with later after the ball i doubt you want hannah to see you with a face as blue as your dress robes that you so vividly described draco retorted and samuel groaned pay me boy was he relentless fine four galleons draco reached in his pocket and pulled out the money little did samuel know he was pricing it ninety galleons too low all right it looks cheap anyway samuel traded the necklace only when he had the four galleons in his hands and draco smiled stubborn bastard he commented dryly and samuel smiled not a compliment his smile faded and he left in quite the hurry once gone hermione turned to draco an inquisitive look on her face why did you fight so hard for that she asked and draco smiled ironically he had taken so much care in hiding it and it was fated to be known despite all that here he handed it to her and she hesitated before taking it into her palms inspecting it with reverent jealousy it very beautiful she said and tried to hand it back to him keep it i bought it for you he said and hermione blushed which just made the churning in his stomach worsen this doesntlook cheap she said slowly while taking a closer look and it doesntlook like it been here very long she looked into his eyes with her chocolate brown ones and he started packing up his things hurriedly i got it when i was in hogsmeade the other day i thought it would go nice with whatever you are wearing he mumbled and hermione gave him a small smile that he pretended not to see it a mood pendant a real one thank you and you were right she stated matter of factly of course i always right what exactly am i right about he asked while turning to look at her a silvery strand of his blonde hair falling in front of his eyes it will go with what i wearing hermione was looking at it again and draco felt uncomfortable he wasntexperienced with the whole nervous around a girl act and it wasntworking well for him it felt like his insides were bent on making him as uncomfortable and outcasted as possible i should go draco said and hermione frowned i thought we were going to work hard the last few days since the ball will be a large interruption hermione said and draco nodded and we have worked hard i think i need some time just to brood and think about how bad life sucks that way i wontbe so negative tomorrow when you actually get to enjoy yourself in my company he said i do enjoy myself when i in your company but not when you re like this you see hermione asked and draco nodded looking anywhere else but at her his stomach was churning worse than ever and all he wanted to do was run run like all malfoy did with that thought dismissed draco made a decision right then what are you waiting for let get started we have a lot of work to do hermione had given him a determined nod and for the five hours they worked after that the churning settled and a weird yet eerily comfortable silence overcame the room draco let the memory of her perfect smile fade from his mind and mentally smacked himself for wasting time this was the exact reason why he tried to stay away from situations that caused feelings like this it was only seven in the morning but draco had a lot to do grabbing a shirt and a pair of pants draco ran through corridor after to corridor until he reached the great hall which was off limits to the rest of the school until the dance draco knocked six times on the door and let out a catcall whistle and the door opened with a loud heavy creak it was about time you got here mr malfoy said the strained and anxious voice of professor flitwick draco looked around the room and smiled things were running seemingly smooth no no don t hold it with two hands like this draco followed the sound of the voice up to the giant christmas tree on the stage draco looked around for the source of the voice but it seemed to be detached from its owner body draco the voice yelled and draco looked up at the christmas tree where granger was leering out at him from between the branches near the top granger is that you he called up to her and she hopped down the tree must have been fifteen feet tall and she landed flawlessly like a cat is that dark tree he asked and hermione shook her head no mcgonagall said i not supposed to go near dark room without someone else who she doesnthate around we should get going then she said and draco shrugged they dontneed our help he asked following her but throwing a glance backwards hermione shook her head mcgonagall had this under control since i got here besides that do you really want to be here when they assign clean up crews she asked and draco laughed not very gryffindor like to skip out on the bad in favor of the good he said and hermione rolled her eyes not even harry gryffindor all the time i always considered myself more of a ravenclaw anyway draco held the door open for her a pleasantly surprised expression on his face and they made their way to the dada classroom it locked draco said as he jiggled the door handle and hermione sighed loudly and you call yourself a pureblood wizard maybe all that inbreeding has finally worked its magic alohomora she turned back to him a clever smile on her lips and draco rolled his eyes not entirely unimpressed with her crude wit hermione opened the door and walked inside slightly hunched over as if what they were doing was wrong why are you acting like a common criminal draco asked and hermione hushed him you do have permission to be in here dontyou he hissed and she gave him a deviant smirk does it matter we re here now draco threw up his hands in frustration as they made their way to dark back office the door open she said and pushed it open with a quiet nudge the hinges gave a loud scream and draco saw hermione jump scared he whispered from behind her and she shushed him with a sharp gesture of her finger once inside hermione did what she was best at telling people what to do you go take care of the boggart i want to have a look around miss dark office draco had agreed only for the simple fact that he did not want to be caught going through a teacher desk especially one he was already on thin ice with draco walked into the small back room and looked up at the huge undecorated tree before him why and how a boggart could possibly hide in a tree was a complete mystery to him nearing the looming plant draco pulled his wand out and lifted his sleeves he was good at this good enough at least riddikulus riddikulus there was a scuffling sound behind the tree and draco raised his wand a loud pop filled the air and draco gave a small start there was silence and draco slowly sidestepped around the tree to get at least a look at his adversary but there was nothing at first looking straight ahead draco had missed the small cloaked thing sliding towards him on the floor when draco finally looked down he almost jumped out of his skin the thing was slowly inching no creeping its way towards him face down it slid across the floor hand after hand reaching out to gain leverage against the smooth surface of the floor as it moved closer draco heard a low rasping emit from its obviously torn and tattered vocal chords it just a boggart he told himself it cantharm you but that did not make it any less frightening then suddenly the worst happened there was another loud pop and draco watched in horror as the boggart took on the physical form of his father lucius malfoy walked towards him his lip curled in disgust and contempt draco cowered from his father pointing his wand only half heartedly in his father direction r riddikulus riddi riddikul draco dropped his wand as the boggart continued and noted the light tapping of wood on cement stumbling backwards draco tripped over a box of ornaments and landed hard on his backside he groaned and started backing away on his hands and his knees but lucius was still coming he was coming to tell draco what a failure he was to tell draco that it was his fault he hit his mother and beat her so badly that she had to spend weeks in the hospital at a time to tell him what a useless filthy creature draco was and how he didntdeserve to live while lucius was six feet under riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus draco cried out even without a wand while covering his ears lucius was shouting at him screaming and screaming until draco thought he could take no more and began to rock back and forth riddikulus he sobbed helplessly trying to shake away the pain and fear the real image and sharp cold voice of his father draco i heard you scream riddikulus draco looked up as his father face contorted in disgust before he melted away into a small dead animal crookshanks hermione whispered but draco could not concentrate on her nonsense at the moment he was still huddled in a ball in the corner of the room hermione shouted something and the dead animal disappeared she had no doubt killed the boggart draco he felt her warm hands touch his hair and he involuntarily jerked away from her soft caring touch what happened draco she asked draco looked up at her through his teary gray eyes and opened his mouth to speak to yell some profanity that would make her stop caring to make her stop looking at him that way that she looked at everyone i was i couldntstop him hermione draco screeched hysterically i couldntstop him and i wanted to it that same feeling when when he hits her all over again draco hung his head over his knees suddenly ashamed at being so weak he was yelling so loud his voice was so loud he wasntscreaming draco she soothed choking back her own tears he was here in this room i swear it he yelled looking into her eyes that were so warm and comforting he now wondered what she saw when she looked into his eyes were they just cold and lifeless dead like he felt no draco she said while leaning forward and her necklace lightly brushed his hand it was a boggart a live projection of your worst fear a hologram that all she touched his arm and he looked up at her a bitter feeling forming in the pit of his stomach suddenly draco reached out and pulled hermione into a helpless desperate embrace it had been a while since he had held someone that cared i promised he whispered promised what draco hermione asked as she repositioned herself so she could pat him on the back and comfort him properly without causing pain or discomfort to herself i promised her that he would never hit her again not while i was still alive he replied weakly pulling her closer i deserve to die draco lucius is dead he canthurt you anymore you or your mother hermione said leaning back to look at him but he did he hit her i know he did the boggart had that same look of triumph that he always had draco argued that what you fear most what did yours turn into he asked while releasing her from his grip and hermione took a seat next to him i saw crookshanks dead he my cat he been missing for almost two months now and i worried he dead draco smiled wiping the tearstains from his cheeks that what you fear most a dead cat he asked incredulously and he immediately regretted saying anything at all hermione scoffed and looked away hurt i ve had crookshanks since my third year and he so much more than a cat she said shortly after five minutes of silence draco stood and held his hand out to her we should probably get back hermione nodded what time is it she asked and draco reached in his pockets searching for his wand looking desperately around for it he remembered he had dropped it when the boggart had been verbally attacking him what is it she asked and draco began to panic the boggart took my wand he exclaimed and hermione shook her head it couldnthave yes and that why it missing mr malfoy miss granger said a dark voice from the doorway and they both froze i see you ve gotten rid of that nasty boggart professor dark began i couldntget within a foot of the thing before i was too scared to move she said draco turned to look at her cold expression and saw that she was twirling something long and made of wood between her oddly elongated fingers my wand he breathed and dark smiled is it yours she asked and draco held out his hand breaking into a teacher classroom to finish an assignment eh what an odd turn of events i was waiting for you two to break your precious headmaster mandate but now i think i ll let you both just turn around and leave why would we have gotten into trouble hermione asked while crossing her arms over her chest angrily you broke into my classroom my office not exactly public property alias stated smartly but sadly i think you two are of more use to me here at hogwarts than expelled and on you way to becoming muggles so i suppose you should go finish setting up for the dance you wouldntwant to be late i positive they re assigning clean up groups and i am sure you two do not want to be excluded draco gave the woman a short disrespectful nod and held out his hand again my wand his voice was low menacing arentwe feeling a little hostile maybe you should get your wand back when you re aloud back in my classroom after all i have it for pretty much the same reason you re being punished she said slowly and draco shook his head what you re insolent ability to break rules without fear of reprimand dark spoke in a low hiss that draco found more than irritating you do not have the authority to hold another wizard wand let alone a student s i would kindly like to remind you that i have other classes besides yours he said and dark shifted the wand to her other hand as if she was waiting for him to jump her or something of the likes we have work professor if you re going to give him his wand give him his wand if not we re going straight to mcgonagall either way we will get the wand and one is no doubt going to be cleaner and less painful for all of us you just have to guess which one hermione said and draco admired her for her attitude despite their slightly dangerous position once again miss granger i think you have forgotten your place on the hogwarts chain of command you re at the bottom you have no bargaining chip dark snapped and hermione crossed her arms over her chest i truly would beg to differ and we can debate this issue for hours but i think it would be safe for me to assume this will be something we just have to agree to disagree about hermione snapped back and dark tossed draco his wand make it four days miss granger four for you as well mr malfoy guilty by association she paused to look at both of them then turned around get out of my classroom and i dontexpect to see you back in it until well after vacation is over draco and hermione walked back to the great hall in silence and only after they reached the large doors could draco say anything i cantbelieve you said that to her he said a half cocked smirk on his face i didntknow you had it in you to be rude to a teacher especially one you re already on thin ice with yeah i sorry about your extended punishment i should have stopped before it got that far she said and draco brushed her words off nah i dontreally fancy her class all that much anyways i d much prefer to teach myself that stuff he replied hermione knocked on the door six times and let out a long low whistle the door flew slowly open and they walked in flitwick assigned them both to projects all the way across the great hall and draco could be caught throwing glances over his shoulder to make sure everything was going all right he truly admired how she had handled the whole situation earlier and he realized with a satisfied smile that he hadnteven had to tell her not to mention what happened to anyone on pain of death he trusted her at four thirty they were dismissed to get ready for the ball and draco threw a kind wave to hermione as she hurried out of the hall she would no doubt spend all the time they had left preparing and this thought brought a feeling of anticipation he remembered how she had looked at hogwarts last ball and not to sound like a guy she had shocked him with her seemingly elegant almost royal appearance she had probably put so much effort into looking great in order to impress that foreign quidditch player krum though but he supposed that that didntmatter anymore that had been two years ago and they had all changed a bit this was no doubt going to be a much more adult experience and there would be no spying on hagrid for his part he fully intended on enjoying the evening and nothing could ruin that resolution draco checked out at six o clock he had not completed his designated hours of volunteer work and went straight to his dorm in the prefect dormitories as he stood next to his armoire it was odd to think that right next door just out of reach hermione was getting dressed as well a mudblood and a snake a curse with two tongues draco had no idea where the weird prophetic words came from but the second they came to mind he shoved them away without a second thought at all there was plenty of time to analyze the foreboding words later right now he had to look his best after all the look on weaselby face would lose its affect if hermione entered the great hall with a bedraggled slytherin on her arm and besides that he wanted pansy to be jealous and he felt as though he owed hermione this much at least as draco readied himself for the dance he hummed quietly to himself one of his favorite songs little did he know that everything would change from his one act of kindness i walking a wire feels like a thousand ways i could fall to want is to buy but to live is to die and i canttake it all when everything is said and done i wonthave one thing left what happened to everything i ve ever known cuz all they gave me was this ticket heaven but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make now i restless and i running from everything i running from everything i afraid it a little too late when soft voices lie innocence dies aintthat a shame then all of your dreams and all your money they dontmean a thing when everything is said and done i wonthave one thing left what happened to everything i ve ever known all they gave me was this ticket heaven but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make now i restless and i running from everything i running from everything i afraid it a little too late a n this is ticket to heaven by 3 doors down i know it amazing i have the greatest selection of music they are amazing and for my current mood they do wonders i so recommend their music to anyone that likes rock chapter 16 the yule ball refined draco waited silently in the hallway outside of the great hall no one had yet arrived not that they were opening the doors yet but this was where hermione and him had decided to meet there was laughter down the hallway and draco looked around suspiciously he was substantially more paranoid at this point in time than he could remember being in a long time what he was doing tonight would likely change the course of his school life as well as the real thing but it was too late to turn back this was the point of no return draco smiled he might as well enjoy it while he was in a controlled environment there would no doubt be repercussions later on but what fun was it to think about that now jesus how long did it take to get ready draco began to fidget with his cloak clasp and shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other soon people were going to show up and draco was slightly apprehensive about how others would receive not only him but also his date looking up at the large doors for the first time draco noticed the large carvings in the magical wood they were similar to something you would see in a jrr tolkein story but much more real draco reached out a finger to trace the thin and curving letters but was interrupted as he noticed a tap on his shoulder about time hermione draco paused when he found himself face to face with pansy parkinson a gryffindor draco she asked slyly and draco sighed or was it staged a little plan of yours to make me jealous the look of arrogance on her face was maddeningly smug and draco would have liked nothing more than to wipe it off with the back of his hand or perhaps you really have feelings for her draco took a small step forward and pansy danced away i don t he said savagely we re frien he stopped himself but it was too late just by saying the root of the word he had sealed the deal since when does draco malfoy make friends of gryffindor mudbloods the dirt beneath his feet she asked a long way you have fallen the dark lord will not be pleased by your lack of loyalty she said and draco eyes widened oh yes pansy whispered excitingly lifting up her robe left sleeve to reveal her branded forearm i forgot to tell you about the fortunate encounter i had with the dark lord he has taken me in in a way you could not she said wistfully how lucky i was to have been guided down the right path all it took was a small nudge from you in the right direction draco felt a sadness so great build within him that he couldnteven look at her sure pansy was a bitch but she just wasntdeath eater material she didnthave it in her to be loyal to anyone for very long let alone the dark lord who was abusive and that would inevitably lead to her death her loss he supposed you pity me she stated and draco nodded meeting her cold blue stare why on earth would you waste your pity on someone who has been so lucky she questioned and draco could not find a suitable answer if that is what you think you are he said quietly and her expression turned from evilly content to angry dontjudge me draco you re no better than me she spat and draco slowly shook his head i chose the right thing to do whereas you did not that makes me not necessarily better but smarter that for sure he said and pansy guffawed rather loudly you ve really got no idea who you are do you she asked with a smile on her face you ve already been marked for darkness draco you can brush off as many death eaters as you like but in the end it will only make it harder on you the dark lord chosen prince of darkness i dontknow about your thoughts on the whole issue but you re not much of a prince go away pansy draco said slowly go find crabbe or goyle or whoever it is today draco said disgusted she was obviously drunk now that he thought about it or else she would be kissing his ass as usual yes your darkness she said with a small bow as she turned and draco lunged forward grabbing her roughly by the arm if you ever call me that again you will wear the imprint of my signet on the side of your face do you hear me he asked and pansy spat in his face draco pulled away with an exclamation of disgust and pushed her from him you haventgot it in you pansy stood and brushed off her dress you re not half the man your father was in fact you look a lot like the mail carrier maybe your mom got tired of getting hit when he fucked her and turned to whoring herself to the less violent types in your neighborhood pansy let out a shrill laugh and draco began to breathe hard he felt the anger boiling just beneath the surface of his skin and he felt something like a spring in his arm waiting to be discharged he wiped the spit from his face and drew himself up tall he wanted so much to hit her right then but he held back for a reason unknown to him her face went slack and a gleam of triumph filled her eyes that what i thought she said you re weak always have been weak and always will be that why your father didntleave you a dime you know she stated haughtily as if she knew so much more about his family than he did you were such a disappointment to your father that he couldntstand the thought of anything let alone the entire family fortune fall into your careless and fragile hands right then draco said while clapping his hands together you see i promised myself i would never strike you but i think that there is something i can do that a lot worse he finished and what is that she asked a grin on her face keep doing what i doing he simply put it and she shook her head you do that draco why would it matter to me whom you re with i know that eventually it will be me again and on your way to that point i will just have to make you miserable maybe then you ll reach the same conclusion that i have but faster than you would have without my help you see there is no way for me to ever reach the same conclusion you re wrong and i not hey people are coming now are you waiting for your date draco was speaking casually even though his pulse was beating dangerously fast yes and there he is have fun with your mudblood maybe she ll give you a good ride and maybe she won t she said and draco nodded there are girls who dontput out pansy but i guess you never were the resilient type bye pansy turned away pissed and draco smiled to himself let her sit on that choice comment for a while the hallway was fast in filling up once people had started to arrive and draco decided to go inside the great hall and wait for hermione there all the prefects had to be inside early anyway and she would no doubt prefer him to exact their plan with great discretion considering draco knocked softly three times and made a hissing sound the door opened quietly and draco slipped inside before anyone noticed the door had opened let alone had admitted a very well dressed slytherin looking around the large hall draco could think of no other word but dazzling the usually drab interior of the great hall was now smothered in white blues reds purples yellows and greens as if in an effort to combine every house colors into one large spectacle it did not look like solely a christmas event but one that could be held in any season at any time the ceiling though is what caught draco breath in his chest the cavernous ceiling was the very image of a clear night sky that opened straight up into the heavens so it seemed stars glittered and fell across the large roof silent clouds moved overhead in creamy white formations and a bright moon hung at the very edge of the ceiling waiting for the ball to start it was an ingenious idea that had been contributed by a hufflepuff prefect when the ball began the moon would begin it slow cycle across the ceiling and when it reached the other side the ball would be over you re here said the stern voice of mcgonagall and draco turned to face the teacher when we let the students in you may want to speak with your date about your duties both you and granger have greeting duties and you will not be able to join the festivities until those attending have been properly greeted and welcomed into the hall she said and draco nodded shouldntbe a problem draco said shortly and mcgonagall gave him a suspicious look you do have a date dontyou she asked skeptically you prefects will be opening the dance and well it wontsend very receptive signals to the rest of your peers if they see their slytherin prefect dancing alone no professor i do have a date she a prefect too and we both have door duty together that why it shouldntbe a problem he said and watched in satisfaction as a look of surprise registered on the woman face this was one of those rare occasions when mcgonagall was actually speechless and draco wanted to enjoy it down to the last stuttered word it almost time where is miss granger mcgonagall finally asked and draco shrugged hell if i know he replied and mcgonagall sighed this was going to be quite the evening hermione harry yelled up the staircase and hermione sighed one second you guys i almost ready she replied while giving herself a final look over in her full size mirror she wore a long maroon dress that trailed behind her in mingling fabrics of lace and see through cotton its strap which was gold hung over one shoulder clasped to her left shoulder was a silver brooch with the gryffindor crest on it that held her long golden dress robes on at the odd angle she was positioning it in giving herself a nod of approval she walked to the door of the girls dormitory the only reason she had chosen to dress with the other girls was so that ron could get one glimpse of what he was missing before the real shocker came to drive the point home the coupe de grace some would call it walking down the steps she was thrown many glances of approval from the other girls as well as some other not so female gryffindors ron stood at the base of the stairs trying relentlessly to straighten his tie but it was to no avail hermione watched in bitter satisfaction as his eyes fell upon her and his expression of frustration was altered to a look of shock and well jealousy he knew she had a date and as last time she had refused to reveal this mystery man name could it be another famous quidditch player from bulgaria ron certainly thought it was possible i ve finished she said and harry looked up at her giving her a knowing smile dontyou have to be there early he asked and hermione nodded we should get going before ron wets himself harry stood just a few inches taller than her and in many ways he differed from draco draco was thinner wiry almost and well built as she had held him she could feel the muscles beneath his clothes and he was certainly stronger than his frail frame suggested harry was stockier but not overweight his small frame was also well built due to his dedication to hogwarts favorite sport suddenly realizing she was comparing her friend and her other friend physique and she quickly switched gears in her mind what was draco wearing to the ball hermione mentally smacked herself and it was obvious by the questioning look that harry gave her that he smack was less mental than she had hoped once they reached the giant doors hermione looked around nervously they had decided to meet outside and by the looks of things it was obvious that she was later than she had wanted to be harry softly nudged her in the side and hermione looked at her his green eyes wide with questions is he here he asked and hermione shook her head tentatively he said we d meet out here but it seems unlikely with all these people around that he would wait maybe i should just go inside and check before hermione could fix her blunder she realized harry had a new piece of information to add to the ever growing puzzle he a prefect then harry asked and hermione shook her head stopped then nodded yes but dontmake any assumptions and donttry to get me to tell you it hard enough telling myself harry looked to ron who was standing off the side of the great hall anteroom waiting for amber is he still mad at me hermione asked suddenly and harry shook his head no tired of being surprised by the way what was draco malfoy doing in your prefectorial dormitory clad only in a towel harry asked his eyebrows raised hermione let out a quick laugh this was something that she had not quite gotten to the point where she could laugh about it all erm he made a mistake with the doors is all she replied quickly while looking away draco had never really explained the whole issue to her and even if he had she doubted she had been in much a mood for listening really from what ron tells me the inside of the bathrooms have the house crests on the doors so mistakes donthappen this was news to hermione i dunno then i really didntfeel like having a conversation with him when he was dressed the way he was hermione replied almost sharply harry was hinting at something that hermione didntlike one bit all right all right no offense meant by it you might want to get inside the dance starts in ten minutes harry voice trailed off and he reached forward hermione back away but he had her necklace in his hands where did you get this and a better question would be what is it it a mood stone and i got it from my erm date hermione replied looking down it was a bright shade of green which unbeknownst to harry meant she was nervous hermione had conveniently forgotten that her emotions were visibly displayed for all to see and quickly grabbed it from harry your date must like you a lot to be giving you gifts like that it looks like it cost a fortune it goes well with your other necklace he commented and hermione knew the wheels in his mind were turning i ll talk with you later she answered his inquiring look and harry nodded slowly make it a promise have fun he said i ll try she said anxiously she didntknow how the evening was going to go stepping away from harry hermione entered the great hall scanning everywhere for some hint of where draco was draco froze when he saw her enter and reacted in a very juvenile way turning the other way he quickly hid behind a well decorated christmas tree what the hell he ran a nervous hand through his soft bleach blonde hair she looked great in a completely non attractive yet sort of illegally attractive way she was muddled blood dressed up in a nice gown with perfect hair she was filthy but then again he was no longer rich no long held to the same standards as before these were dangerous thoughts dangerous doubts and draco found himself eagerly surprised fuck it he said slowly while taking a deep breath walking out from behind the christmas tree draco looked for her but now she was gone shit that was ironic draco thought bitterly draco walked over to where he had been standing before and began sorting menus again this was the job he had been assigned for prefect pre ball work someone cleared their throat behind draco and he turned slightly irritated could you possibly do that elsewhere he asked before he truly saw who it was and he suddenly stumbled backwards in surprise hermione wow you erm came out of no where he said his voice taking on an odd fluctuation and suddenly he felt very uncomfortable in his own skin it pretty you see i wore it she said holding out her necklace for him to look at but he didntlook down for fear of his eyes wandering yes i see i knew it would he stuttered dumbly while trying to avert her gaze we have greeting duty he said and mentally calmed himself she probably thought he was having a mental breakdown maybe he was that would explain everything that was happening and chances were that in the morning he would feel nothing for her and this sudden clumsiness would be gone for good i know i just got through talking to mcgonagall she seems very excited hermione said and draco realized she was trying to make small talk yeah what else do the teachers have to look forward he slowly felt the twisting knot in his stomach loosen as he became more comfortable in her very oddly female presence you want to help me finish up here he asked quietly and she nodded wow this is a lot of complicated food hermione said slowly and draco nodded not quite comprehending why she would make such an observation yeah it looks like they really wanted this ball to be remembered draco commented dryly in an attempt to keep the silence away i hope the house elves have plenty of help she finished and draco was taken aback he stopped working and stared at her house elves you re worried about house elves he asked with a smirk and hermione glared they arenttreated the greatest you know she said and besides how would you like it if you had to do all this work you didntget paid and you didntget holiday or sick leave or any kind of medical or dental plan at all draco shrugged that wouldnthappen so why worry he said with a smirk and besides hermione they like what they do haventyou been in the kitchens they practically trample one another to bow at your feet and give you exactly what you want and that makes it okay they dontknow any better than to do your bidding it all they ve ever known she said her eyes taking on an empathetic sparkle that made him feel guilty for seeing things the way he saw them they dont want to know anything else he said dobby did draco cringed at the name of his old house elf dobby didntlike being treated the way your family treated him there are always weird ones hermione like you for instance you re a witch the first witch in your family right he asked and she nodded there you go there always a weird one hermione smacked his arm playfully and sighed just dontworry too much about it they re fine they like what they do and as potty kindly pointed out to me the other day some of them do get paid oh the ball about to start it six forty five already hermione exclaimed before they could carry on their debate we should finish this up so that samuel can put them at the right tables once they finished sorting the menus into the correct stacks they waved samuel over so that he could put them at the right tables hermione and draco walked silently to the doors and waited for them to be opened you ready for this hermione asked and draco straightened his neat outfit and picked invisible lint from his vest i was born ready besides who cares if i about to do something that completely contradicts my father teaching i never much liked him anyway he was a bit too quick to brandish that cane of his he saw hermione brush off his reference to being physically abused with a kind smile and he admired her social skills she would have made an appropriate arm ornament for any social event his family could hold if only she were pureblooded hermione saw the look on draco face and innately could tell he was thinking of some very unpleasant past experience from the tight lipped smile he returned to her she could tell it had something to do with her more specifically her blood two more minutes until everyone knows the truth about draco malfoy hermione thought silently and two more minutes until her friends knew she had betrayed them there were seven loud rings from the clock tower and the doors slowly opened the crowd outside had been told to form a line outside the door and so they had good evening hope you enjoy the ball hermione repeated the line so many times over the next ten minutes that she actually found herself saying good ball hope you enjoy the good evening i think that it draco said as the last person in the line entered and took their seats hermione nodded slowly yeah but remember what mcgonagall said wait an extra five minutes before leaving our post even last minutes stragglers should be greeted and welcomed draco finished and hermione gave a soft laugh so you do listen hermione said in mocked astonishment yes but donttell anyone five minutes later hermione and draco took their seats at the prefect table and waited for the headmaster to give his speech but instead mcgonagall strode to the podium looking slightly disheveled and annoyed good evening hogwarts students i will be speaking tonight on behalf of our honored headmaster as he is slightly under the weather hermione noted the slight pause in mcgonagall speech and knew something was amiss tonight we welcome into the hall of our great school the well known band the killers singing an assortment of songs draco looked across the table at hermione as he clapped and she opened her eyes wide i didntthink non magic people could enter hogwarts she said and draco raised his eyebrows who ever said they werentmagic he asked and hermione shrugged no one but no one ever said they were exactly draco turned his eyes back to the front and hermione let the shock sink in the killers were wizards graduates of hogwarts themselves due to an embarrassing misunderstanding these fine young gentlemen brandon flowers david keuning mark stoermer and ronald vannucci but mcgonagall was cut short as four men walked into the large hall unannounced they walked up to where mcgonagall stood and began setting up their equipment excuse me one said to her with a winning smile and mcgonagall sighed throwing her hands up in resignation and walked back to her seat hello hogwarts brandon flowers here to present to you all my band can you all give a warm welcome to us the killers the man at the front and center of the stage asked with a distinctly american accent and there was warm clapping all through the hall as a graduate of mcgonagall strict classes i can say it was best we just walked in and took control am i right no grand introductions for old minerva or she would have been on about us for hours he asked and there was loud cheering throughout the hall hermione was slightly irked at his rudeness towards their teacher but let it go we re going to go ahead and open up this dance with a slow song prefects find your partner and get to it the strumming of soft guitar began to flow around the room and eight people stood seeking out their dates hermione looked at draco who seemed very unsure come on she began everyone waiting we donthave time for second thoughts she grabbed his hand and walked him slowly out to the dance floor draco was scared shitless no second thoughts he had no idea what the hell he was doing and once they reached the dance floor he just stood there staring dumbly at hermione she rolled her eyes and grabbed his hands he wanted to resist her to run away and hide under some table but with his eyes wide and apprehensive he let hermione place his hands on her waist and in turn put hers around his neck this is when you lead hermione whispered in his ear and draco gulped loudly this was completely out of character for him he usually jumped at the opportunity to lead to control straightening his back draco stood up proudly and did what he had been taught as a young boy in a noble household you re a good dancer hermione said with a smile but then again i sure you ve gone to many a public function and had to perform well draco nodded absentmindedly he was no longer paying attention to the exact footwork nor even the sound of her voice draco was concentrating solely on what he was doing and whom he was with hermione a gryffindor coming out of my cage and i ve been doing just fine gotta gotta be down because i want it all started out with a kiss how did it end up like this it was only a kiss it was only a kiss the rhythm flowed through the dance floor its pulsing beat affecting the overall mood of the room after the initial dancing had taken place people from all over the hall were standing and joining the ranks on the dance floor you seeing what i seeing harry asked a surprised ron and harry nodded slowly i knew something was up with her lately i should have guessed who she was going with harry said sullenly who better to go with if she wanted to get back at you for going with amber hearing her name mentioned amber tuned into the conversation what now she asked and ron shrugged dontworry about it amber ron replied distractedly you want to dance he asked she nodded yes mr nice guy i love this song she said and harry waved goodbye to his friend he was now left at the table alone staring at his plate why so sad harry harry looked up to meet the gaze of ron weasley youngest and only female sibling hey ginny he said where collin he asked suddenly looking around for her date he bailed last minute he said his mum sent him an owl telling him to come home right away ginny replied he looked really distraught i dontlike that he not here harry said slowly it safer here than anywhere else ginny nodded taking the seat across from harry what do you think voldemort doing harry she asked slowly after a moment of silence but harry didntwant to think about voldemort right now i dontcare whatever he doing he not clueing me in on it and for that i am thankful maybe i can finally get a moment peace he replied bitterly he looked down at his plate and ginny reached across the table grabbing his hand you know i decided to go with collin because he asked first right he didntwant to go alone and i didntwant him to go home it not safe out there anymore especially since they ve been targeting muggle born wizarding households ginny said quietly while giving harry hand a slight squeeze which he returned softly yeah i know he whispered i guess it didntdo any good in the long run eh she stated and harry gave a short humorless laugh he not going to survive holiday break ginny he said sadly and ginny nodded tears filling her eyes i know harry i know looking at harry she lifted his chin until their eyes met there was nothing you could do about sirius about collin and his brother there was nothing you could do for dumbledore either you are not superman harry stop treating yourself as if you are if you let it the weight of the world is going to crush you and what good will that do for anyone she paused her eyes glittering with a fire he hadntseen since the night her father had been tortured by death eaters you are the boy who lived and you were spared for more than this to waste away and die she finished and harry nodded the same feeling of helpless rage and anger coursing through him i should have been able to do something for them all of them ginny i am the boy who lived and that fact alone has made me superman i couldntsave cedric either he said suddenly you know i still wake from dreams where he screams at me yells my name calls for help i hear his voice crying begging for mercy begging for some kind of revenge for his death but i do nothing i wait i watch and i listen i safe when others who should be aren t harry paused it is me he wants but instead of hitting his target directly voldemort tortures me by killing those around me ginny squeezed his hand again that is why you need to be strong you have people who love you harry and until you realize this you will be what you truly think you are completely and utterly alone something you have never been and never will be she smiled at him through silent tears do not resign yourself to a slow and painful death fight harry fight for us like your mother fought for you hermione leaned into draco taking in the masculine scent of him as if it were a flower she could feel his rigid response but harbored no regrets that she was here doing what she was doing now he takes off her dress now let me go and i just cantlook it killing me and taking control jealousy turning saints into the sea swimming through sick lullabies choking on your alibi but it just the price i pay destiny is calling me open up my eager eyes cuz i mr brightside the music faded with a low hum and the dancers all let out a cheer of appreciation to the band which bowed over dramatically draco looked at hermione and she had no idea what to say an odd event so hermione said and draco shrugged looking past draco hermione eyes focused on a red haired figure it was ron and he was with amber but he was looking at her glaring as if she had killed her own mother what wrong draco asked i didntmean to step on your foot if i did he said quickly and hermione let out a laugh no it just i think i got the affect i wanted ron pissed she said and draco looked over his shoulder seeing ron he smirked looking quite pleased good then maybe the gryffindork will think twice before being a jackass draco said arrogantly and hermione placed her hands on her hips what and you honestly think you have room to speak she asked just a month ago my name as far as you were concerned was either mudblood or granger not exactly the most charming names either of them hermione said and draco shrugged nonchalantly well that what you were at that point in time things change to me they re still gryffindorks he said and hermione rolled her eyes and what does that make me she asked and draco shrugged slowly looking away different better different beautiful he gulped loudly had he really said that aloud from the look on hermione face he had her large brown eyes registered with surprise and her lips twitched into what he would assume was an inner smile clearing his throat draco would have done anything to get away do you want some punch draco asked and hermione nodded i ll see you at the prefect table then she said turning right then draco rushed off in the opposite direction and upon reaching the punch table smacked his forehead with violently high force what was he thinking this would never work despite the small twinge of attraction he felt for his enemy sidekick nothing would ever come of it inside hogwarts let alone outside which no doubt she would expect but on the other side of things what did he expect to come of this whole thing he had known better from the beginning to invest any kind of emotion or attachment to anything not owned or immune from the dark lord hermione was not either of those in fact she had been targeted in their second year at hogwarts had been attacked by the beast from the chamber of secrets for her blood there had even been a planned attack on her home over summer but his father had been detained due to the charges many of the death eaters had had to face for the capture and animal like torture they had subjected arthur weasley to without his fanatic loyalty to the dark lord the other death eaters had bailed though he deeply regretted the knowledge of this it had been planned to be draco first attack on a muggle descendant wizarding home realizing he had in fact come to the punch for a particular reason draco filled two small clear cups with the sparkling metallic liquid and instinctively sniffed it observing it for any unusual qualities it smelled and looked normal enough for a magically manufactured drink and he walked to the prefect table where hermione was waiting hands folded innocently in her lap as he sat down he saw hermione let out a sigh of relief and she looked at him a half smile on her lips i didntthink you were coming back she said slowly and quiet enough so that only he could hear and draco brushed her comment off like a speck of dust please draco said with a dismissive wave of his hand i didntlet weasel ditch you what makes you think i would stoop that low but he didntwait for an answer as he shoved her glass towards her drink up he said before taking a large drink of his own drink she had every reason to believe he hadntplanned on coming back and he hated knowing that but he had come back after finishing off the drink draco waited for hermione to do the same what wrong he asked seeing that her eyes were sadly focused across the room where her black haired friend sat with the younger female weasley he looks so old hermione said like the weight of the world is on his shoulders hermione said wistfully i wonder if that is what he truly believes draco didntknow what to say he knew he couldntdismiss her worries just like that after all they were merited and they meant something to her even if they meant less to him than she would ever know do you want to go say hello draco asked his teeth clenched and hermione eyes snapped to his no doubt to see if he was serious go on i ll wait here until you get back have a dance or two with him maybe that ll make him smile a bit thank you i ll be back i dontknow if he feels much like dancing with me when he has ginny there with him she said as she stood he watched her hesitate in grabbing her purse and then she released it she was going to trust him with one of her most important possessions and she knew it was a risk considering who he was he d be crazy not to want to dance with you hell i wanted to dance with you draco said with a smile and hermione rolled her eyes do you want to come over with me and say hello hermione asked on a whim and draco threw his hands up in the air a terrified look on his face whoa we dontexactly get along potter and i i think you know that draco replied and hermione nodded i just wanted to offer i dontwant you to feel like i ditching you for one of my other friends she said i should probably go over there if i plan to eh draco nodded and watched her walk over to the other table and talk to potty what could they be talking about hey harry harry looked up from ginny eyes and smiled as he saw hermione approach you really did keep us all guessing till the end hermione not even ginny knew eh he asked and hermione was relieved that he wasntangry with her i didntwant you all to think that i was betraying you hermione said quietly and harry nodded not telling us didntchange what you did you know ginny cut in and hermione could sense that ginny was a little hostile ron was being immature and draco did something that could irreversibly damage everything he has striven to attain here draco this is draco malfoy hermione hello he a snake with blue eyes and a nice haircut ginny practically shouted i cantbelieve you of all people are falling for that stupid fa ade oh so now i stupid am i hermione asked crossing her arms over her chest defensively no but you re sure acting the part he no good for you he no good for anyone ginny spoke softly but the words themselves cut like ice on hermione flesh i didntcome over here to argue about going to the dance with a slytherin hermione stated bitterly a death eater dontforget his other title ginny interrupted and harry shook his head he is not a death eater hermione replied sharply and as i was saying i here with him and there is nothing you can do to go back accept it and brighten up hermione silently pleaded with harry eyes but he merely shook his head collin left harry said and hermione felt the air catch in her throat w why would he do that i thought he was going with you ginny why did he leave ginny pulled out the seat next to her and hermione sat slowly he got an owl from his mum i read it myself it seemed legitimate but isntthat voldemort specialty ginny asked bitterly there was no persuading him to stay i swear if i i think it time for a new order of the phoenix guys harry interrupted one that we as wizards and students can be involved in he finished and ginny sighed but hermione was avidly listening like dumbledore army hermione asked and harry smirked giving a small chuckle yeah we re a bit wiser now though eh he said taking a drink of punch that had magically appeared at his side dobby hermione asked and harry nodded i ve already discussed the possibilities with mcgonagall and she says that she cannot openly support our ventures as a student body but that she guarantees that the fifth classroom on the second floor will be empty every thursday evening from six until twelve hermione smiled widely now hermione i going to need your excellent charm work once again same drill as last time but we need to stay one step ahead this time that going to be hard to do considering ginny whispered under her breath and hermione nudged her sharply in the ribs what last time we got found out and she wasnt dating the enemy we re not dating it was merely a an arrangement of convenience ginny hermione practically whisper shouted now grow up i not going to tell draco anything but i will give him an opportunity just as you will to your friends hermione said and ginny shrugged fine if you want this to last more than a week though i suggest you forget the slytherin and recall where your loyalties lie ginny snarled and hermione felt the most distant from her best friend than she had felt in a long while if that is what you think then ginny i pity you i am more loyal to gryffindor than ever right now and if you refuse to accept a gifted slytherin into your defense classes than you might as well forget to invite a talented gryffindor as well hermione spoke slowly as if she wanted them to savor ever syllable draco is just as much a victim as you or i except he behind enemy lines ginny shouted and there was silence around them for a moment be careful ginny harry said keep it down and stop arguing honestly the things you two fight over can be construed as petty hermione and ginny both threw harry death glares and he busied himself with folding his napkin into fourths then eighths then sixteenths and you dontthink that can be used to our advantage hermione asked slyly and ginny shrugged i suppose until he switches sides as soon as things get hard that what he does it was easier to be your enemy when his father was around because you were the epitome of what lucius hated which moved the limelight off of malfoy who knows maybe it ll be easier for him to be voldemort enemy next week because for the moment he wants to be in your good graces then the week after that him and voldemort are drinking tea stop of the ruins of the wizarding world talking about how blue the sky is hermione rolled her eyes isnttrust supposed to be a gryffindor quality hermione asked suddenly and harry looked up at her if you canttrust me but i can trust a slytherin what does that say about the houses hermione asked they re bullshit that what is says hermione stood and set something down on the table harry if you can give me a list of the entry requirements for your order of the phoenix by friday i may be able to get as many muddy blooded gryffindors as i can though i doubt many will reach your high standards after all only gryffindors and crushes deserve to be taught how to equip themselves against the dark arts i going to go back to my date now and we re going to have a good time hmmm a gryffindor and a slytherin draco watched hermione approach a sullen and not at all inviting expression on her face let dance she said while grabbing his hand draco let out a short lived squeak as she hoisted him up and pulled him onto the dance floor i ready to have some real fun draco stood in the middle of the floor trying to recognize the beat of the song he soon recognized it but had no idea how to dance to it he had been taught classic dances the kind one would execute at a formal function not these sporadic degrading and weird looking convulsion like movements today youth called dancing what are you doing hermione asked and draco shrugged his hands falling to his sides in sad indignation i cantdance to this he said and hermione smirked oh yes you can draco knew he had to of looked like a fool but he didntcare he was having the time of his life convulsing like an animal in the grips of an epileptic seizure he was laughing hermione was laughing and that was all that mattered at the moment after giving him a few little tips here and there draco had picked up the spontaneous dance moves and incorporated them into what he had been taught since boyhood there you go hermione said as they walked back to the prefect table a smile on her face see dancing can be a fun experience draco shook his head slowly that milady was not dancing he replied and hermione rolled her eyes maybe not to your standards but to mine that was just fine draco reached for his cup which he realized was empty looking across the table draco saw that hermione glass was also empty now want me to go and get us some punch draco asked and hermione nodded looking at him funny then he realized that he must seem like a whole different person to her that would be nice she said and draco gave a short curt bow and went on his way two empty glasses clutched in his hands humming along with the music draco made his way to the punch table where he ladled the same pinkish metallic liquid into their glasses hermione watched as his figure retreated and saw trouble ron and amber were at the punch table as well hello drakikins ron hissed in a mean undertone and the slytherin boiled how your evening been you great guy you he asked ron was enjoying watching the conflict pass and burn in his enemy eyes let me help you with that ron reached forward and grabbed draco cup slowly tipping the small glass of punch all down draco front ron let out a laugh the music may not have stopped but everyone attention turned towards the conflict at the punch table you fucking bastard this complete outfit cost more than your entire family ever seen draco snarled in a dangerously low tone without his normal resistance level draco lifted his fist and smashed it into the side of weasel face the red head fell backwards over the punch table spilling the bowls contents all over his date shoes ronald amber shouted but ron wasntpaying her any attention he was focused on the slytherin in front of him the one who had stolen his date you had to prove that you could do it didntyou ron asked as he stood and rubbed his cheek you had to test the limits and now that you ve pissed everyone off none of your little goons are here to fight for you i dontwant to fight you weaselby for once i dontwant to fight you draco said slowly but ron wasntgoing to take no for an answer his cheek was an angry red and draco could see the fire behind his eyes is that what my father said before you tortured him is it well draco sometimes no doesntmean a thing not a damn thing ron released the clasp of his dress robes and handed them to amber who was looking on in disbelief why cantyou just let me be draco asked and ron laughed if this is an act for our lady hermione she not watching anymore lover boy she left when you threw the first punch draco turned to the table and before he realized he had fallen for a nasty trick he felt weasley fist make painful contact with the fair skin of his own cheek draco reacted on pure instinct that had been drilled into him since childhood reaching with desperate hands he grabbed a hold of the rough abrasive material of weasel shirt and pulled this caught weasel off guard and he flew forwards knocking draco off his feet as well but draco had been prepared and braced himself for the fall after absorbing the brunt of the fall draco stood brushing off his robes and giving a last look around walked towards the prefect table sorry about this hermione i leaving i donthave to deal with this shit he said and grabbed his prefect badge off the table see you whenever he shouted over his shoulder and he began the long walk to the entry doors you fucking coward ron yelled from the ground and draco looked back weasley was on the ground holding his fingers tight over his bleeding nose i guess daddy not here to save you go on run like i sure you always do no one needs you here no one wants you here draco stopped and pointed at him brandishing his arm as if it were a wand he opened his mouth but looking over at hermione the words died on the tip of his tongue whatever you think weasley more power to you he said with a smirk and a mock salute taking a bow draco left the hall in a flurry of stained robes and silvery blond hair fucking coward ron whispered as he helped himself to his feet if you really wanted to go with her so bad why d you bother even asking me amber suddenly shouted and ron jumped startled at the sudden outburst he did it to piss me off ron sputtered and amber crossed her arms over her chest and looked down at him her dark brown hair flowing over her shoulders in elegant tendrils if you didntwant to go with her then it shouldnthave pissed you off you were with me amber glared at ron before pushing her handbag back up her arm you deserve the broken nose she said while turning and ron laughed it not broken amber spun around and decked him clear on the nose no well i sure hope it is now think twice before using a girl as pay back it will eventually bite you in the ass and i dontthink you like that part she said and turned and walked out of the hall hermione could not even look him in the eyes when she approached by now everyone had gone back to dancing and only harry and ginny were with ron you want a go too then ron asked bitterly while glaring at hermione as a matter of fact yes i think i will have a go at this point i think that you deserve anything you get hermione crossed her arms and ron braced himself well are you going to hit me he asked and hermione laughed it was almost a giggle i can do so much worse than hit you ronald why would i waste my revenge on some physical retribution when a well planned and organized one will give me so much more satisfaction hermione smiled and heard harry give a small laugh so now you re siding with them ron asked and harry shrugged you too ginny i see that those blokes who said blood was thicker than water were either drunk or had no family ron comment dryly you re the one who acted like an ass ginny said and hermione smiled ginny was back on her side and despite the slightest twinge of anger towards her young friend she was glad to be on the same side again ginny made a better ally than a foe that was for sure hermione looked anxiously towards the doors knowing that she couldntleave at least one of them had to be here and well draco wasn t looking up at the ceiling hermione saw that the moon was only half way through the sky there was still a while to go walking back to the prefect table followed by harry and ginny hermione sat wondering what draco was doing draco shuffled the documents around in a mad hurry he was so angry that he couldnteven think straight looking through the documents in sequence he realized something was missing back stepping he found that there was a two parchment gap between five hundred thirty six and five hundred thirty nine looking through the surrounding stacks draco checked for the misplaced documents but they were nowhere to be found damn draco exclaimed it was odd that only those two documents were missing and as draco looked through their records he realized that they had been missing the whole time he had the innate feeling that they were very important and found it odd that they were the only two they had not numbered standing draco scratched his head and let out a loud sigh come out come out wherever you are if i were an important document where would i hide looking around draco eyes fell upon a very suspiciously lopsided portrait as he moved towards the painting his heart began beating faster he felt like he was on the edge of a precipice and the only choice of direction he had was up or down up or down the documents could be in there the key to what they were missing or they could be gone destroyed years before by the same person that had tampered with them in the first place draco moved aside the painting and found hard brick suddenly his heart was in his stomach in a spurt of anger her knocked the portrait off the wall and let out a howl of frustration after months of hard work this was where they were at a dead fricken end draco struck the wall and felt a crack beneath his hand the brick was crumbling hitting it again he felt the rock slide forward a little further now using his elbow he managed to make a hole big enough for his hand to fit through taking hold of the decaying brick he pulled hard dislodging even more of the fragile blocks revealing a deep cave in the wall draco ran to the table and grabbed his wand lumos he whispered and the end of his wand lit up like a firefly had been impaled on its end moving the tip carefully inside draco let a silent prayer pass between his lips there was parchment inside draco hurriedly grasped at it and pulled it from within the bowels of the wall looking over it he read the latin in his head this was it this was the key draco sat down at the table and immediately began decoding and decrypting the hidden message as he reached the end he realized that everything before this point and everything after suddenly made sense draco stood in a hurry and ran out the door forgetting even to put up the security screen around the room hermione rolled her eyes as one of the band members made a pass at her during intermission and almost got up and left this was turning out to be far worse than she had originally anticipated suddenly the hall doors banged open and hermione watched draco rush in his clothes disheveled an excited look on his face walking straight up to hermione draco grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her away from her conversation with harry and ginny what going on draco she asked but draco was mumbling incoherently as he pulled her out of the hall up three flights of stairs and through uncountable corridors to the library the documents were missing they were right there the portrait was a decoy and it works i did it he exclaimed as he pushed her through the doorway and walked ahead of her to the table grabbing the documents from the table he thrust them into her hands and waited for her to make the same discovery oh my god draco hermione whispered looking up at him a wild grin spread across her face is this real did you really do this she asked and draco nodded i think it is this is it draco said quietly she looked more radiant now with her hair disheveled and clothes not perfectly laid across her lap than ever before and he resisted the urge to kiss her you really did it how oh draco you did it hermione unexpectedly threw her arms around draco neck and leaned forward to kiss him on the cheek just at that moment draco tried to turn away but instead his lips were caught by hers and draco was plunged into some kind of deeper awareness his arms instinctively went around her waist and hers found his neck though it was an accidental brush of the lips it lasted much longer than any accident draco had ever had and it was certainly much better than any as well parting draco heard a rustle outside the door and realized his blunder well well well so this is the new spot eh ronald weasley stepped into the doorway and draco felt his heart sink and watched in empathy as hermione face lit up with dread mingled with euphoria at the events that had just transpired between them a n sorry it took so long to update but my muse left me alone for a week sorry this is so short but it just a transition chapter hope you like it complicated themes cause me great heartache and i am currently bogged down with schoolwork i have a wasl exam coming up and i am working on two other fanfictions one for dune and one for the mummy well enjoy chapter 17 nightmares and comforting words hermione turned slowly dread filling her chest that had seconds before been beating so fast she could have sworn she had just run a mile you dontunderstand i sure as hell dontbut no matter the excuses you will no doubt make up what you two were doing could be considered a gross abuse of station ron said with a malicious smirk dontbe foolish hermione said with a dismissive wave of her shaky hand we were working i see that why draco there is wearing a spot of your lip gloss yeah right there mate hermione blushed and draco hand moved instinctively to his lips and he rubbed the sticky scented pink mess off of his face you re not supposed to be in here draco said in a low voice he was very aware of his sporting a split lip and a bruised cheek from weaselby lowly attack on his person draco felt the blood rise to his face the more he thought about what had happened downstairs and the more he thought the more he realized he didntwant this to go any further right this second he wanted time to think right ron said in a disgusted tone i ll just be leaving you two alone then he threw a glare to hermione and said i dontfraternize with traitors he paused let alone a death eater he added looking back to draco his chin pointedly raised ron turned and hermione to draco surprise and indignation lunged forward ron she grabbed the sleeve of his robe she wasntready to admit that ron was doing this because he could ron wait you dontget it she shouted we ve worked so hard i was so excited it was a mistake draco surprisingly felt a pang of something he recognized as hurt and allowed a frown to twist his darkly handsome features pretty long mistake wouldntyou say he asked looking at draco and draco smiled ron violently pulled his sleeve from hermione grasp and walked out of the room his dress robes trailing behind him like a flag in the wind hermione let her arms fall to her side and looked down at her feet then to draco who was just as uncomfortable as she was and a little bitter draco i i should probably be heading to bed big day tomorrow it being christmas and all he said quickly and the guilty expression on her face gave him little comfort right see you whenever draco save it mudblood he knew his words cut her because she stopped trying to dissuade him and merely stood in helpless disbelief he was the second friend of hers to walk away that night hermione woke early in the morning it was the first day back to school and everyone had been buzzing about the disappearance of collin creevey all week christmas at hogwarts had come and passed quickly and now it was back to hard work and plenty of study the saturday after the dance hermione had found a stack of papers on her side of the table in the library she recognized them as the codes their dada class had made and she assumed they were her exact equal shares in the assignment it felt weird that whenever she entered the library room it was either empty or draco left just as she entered she took it as a sign he was either pissed at her or he was embarrassed about what had happened on wednesday her own cheeks still burned red whenever she thought of it what made her think he was exempt from those kind of emotions but then again she wouldntput it past draco to be pissed either and it wasntlike he would tell her what was wrong that wasnthow draco functioned whenever they shared a class he sat at the opposite side of the room and whenever they passed eachother in the hallway he looked away refusing to meet her eyes weeks passed and hermione slowly got used to being alone in the room she often just went in there to read and since they had nothing more to do with the documents other than translations she just relaxed and sat in there for hours at a time late on thursday night three weeks after the ball hermione sat in the room reading her newest book magical mysteries a book for the muggle born witch or wizard it was very interesting the things she learned in the book what she found most interesting though was in the index she had found an entire appendix of pureblooded wizard family trees malfoys included it seemed that draco family could be traced back into when rome had still been a thriving city state it seemed odd to see all of those names in that list and hermione felt at a loss maybe one day she would make her own family tree trace her roots back far enough to where it didntmatter who she was as hermione went through the many names in the diagram she had looked many of them up in the reference section of the library and it seemed as though draco had quite the tradition to uphold only one of the malfoys on that list was well known for doing something good and that had been draco great great great great great and so on grandfather draco the benevolent draco in 621 bc published what was thought to be the first comprehensive code of laws in athens but after a while hermione had grown tired of reading about the horrible things draco ancestors had done to get where they currently were she was more interested in the changes draco himself was willing to offer he had called her mudblood it had been a while since she had heard that word and she had forgotten the stinging affect it could have on a person he had called her mudblood you deserved it she snarled whispering to herself as she set her book down on the table rubbing her eyes she let out a loud yawn suddenly there was a shuffling in the corner and she turned quickly to see what had caused the disturbance nothing just empty seats and silence hermione eyes swept over the room once more and when she was satisfied that nothing but her imagination was amiss she grabbed her book from the table and opened it up back to the pureblood appendix she vaguely smiled this is becoming an obsession the most noble house of black hermione uttered with a sad smile sirius family but that family had ended with sirius the year before bellatrix lestrange was hardly to be considered a black anymore she was a death eater and death eaters upon taking their oaths belonged to voldemort family reading through the list of names one in particular caught her attention diana she had heard that name somewhere before it was like seeing a face on the television and not quite remembering a name frustrated hermione shrugged and turned back to the actual book part of the book she was tired of being reminded how odd she was no direct wizarding blood yet she was better at magic than the pure of the pure it all just seemed odd hermione attention snapped around suddenly when she heard a loud groan and then a shout no i wontdo it hermione stood her heart pounding wildly in her chest taking slow steps forward she followed the thrashing and groaning that was so near she could feel the wind it was creating on her face but she saw nothing reaching forward her palm open hermione grasped at what should have been air taking a silk like material in her hand she pulled it back to reveal a slumbering draco hermione could have screamed she was so shocked but she held back and let out a sigh of tainted relief she was glad he was here though she knew she shouldnthave been it was odd and quite clever that he had used two chairs pushed together as a kind of makeshift couch and she wondered why she hadntnoticed the weird formation hermione looked at him his eyes were moving fast beneath his eyelids and she wondered what he was dreaming about wondered if he had lately thought of the kiss they had shared after all she did seeing a strand of silvery blond hair hanging over his eyes she reached forward to push it aside abruptly he sat straight up grabbing her arm hermione started which pushed her backwards and onto her lower back painfully quick his eyelids opened revealing their grayish blue color as he shouted not the mark draco she asked fearfully and draco looked down at her she saw an expression of relief flit over his features before they returned to the normal stony demeanor of draco malfoy son of a death eater he released her arm what are you doing granger he hissed his voice fluctuating slightly trying to give a sleeping man a heart attack hermione smiled slightly embarrassed that she had disturbed him then she remembered the flowing silvery material that was currently covering the other half of his body how often do you do this hermione asked do what he asked dumbly and hermione stood placing her hands on her hips defiantly come in here and wear that cloak so no one can see you hermione replied angrily that a nasty trick she said wasnta trick he replied shortly while rubbing his eyes i find that it easier to sleep when someone around and i donthave a dorm full of sleeping bodies to go to he opened his mouth wide and stretched while yawning it just so happened that i knew you spent most of if not all of your time in here either reading singing or you know doing your job he said slowly his eyes looking down why dontyou sleep in the slytherin dorms hermione inquired interestedly nightma i dunno it nicer up here he interrupted himself nice and toasty dontyou agree he obviously didntwant to talk about his reasons and hermione decided to skirt the subject but not entirely abandon it why haventyou been talking to me lately it obvious you re up here why dontyou help me or at least acknowledge that we re in the same room together draco shrugged if it about the yule it not so dontget all awkward on me since we took care of that boggart i ve been having the same dream draco said slowly changing the subject quickly too quickly he closed his eyes as if trying to remember the dream i in my father arms and he is taking me towards the dark lord they intend to brand me make me a death eater but not a normal one they have something special planned for me draco paused and hermione urged him to continue i must be a baby because in the dream i am completely helpless and then there this girl she got my hair and my eyes and i miss her so much i can actually feel it he said choking on his words who is she hermione asked is she a girlfriend draco shook his head and hermione felt oddly relieved why would they want to brand you when you were a baby i dunno some kind of early bondage thing i canttell my mother taught me how to analyze dreams but none of it makes any sense at all according to my analysis i am a girl trapped in a male body and i feel the need to be controlled and herded like an animal the colors mean i am happy and over all i really a kindly person hermione cringed not me he asked with a smile and she shook her head maybe it not a normal dream maybe it a memory hermione offered and draco shook his head look he lifted his sleeve and held his forearm out towards her i have no mark he saw her eyes lingering on the scars along his veins in distinct cutting patterns and quickly withdrew his arm i donthave a mark that rules out it being a memory of that sort what about the girl could she be a memory do you have a sister draco shook his head my mom said i used to have a friend from germany she and i were supposedly close until her mum got a job in russia as a head of the magical malady department in the russian ministry of magic draco paused thinking i dontremember much about this girl other than the fact she spoke really bad german the same way i did when i was just learning it your mom could have lied hermione said and this seemed to open a whole new realm of possibilities for draco why would she though he asked and hermione shrugged i know that my mum used to tell me stories about life before the dark lord about my father before he came under almost complete control of the voldemort but she never told me why they hated each other he added i dontknow why i telling you all this he said suddenly with something resembling a chuckle and turned ready to go to the table and read maybe do some work then don t she said shortly and draco shook his head no he said quickly i dontmind talking to you about it it just seems odd that i want to is all why odd she asked you can figure that out hermione rolled her eyes and sighed loudly she was obviously one of those girls who liked to communicate who else have you talked about this with hermione asked and draco bit his lip recalling the few conversations he had had recently no one lately i used to talk to snape a lot he was more of a father to me than my own but very recently i discovered something about our potions master that has made me rethink my decision to share the most intimate details of my life he said slowly he a death eater hermione said with a smile as she took a chair from the table and set it in front of draco makeshift couch how did you know draco asked in disbelief she and her little friends were obviously more informed than anyone who worked for his father could have ever guessed when one is close friends with harry potter you are bound to know more than the average student she said vaguely answering his question how long have you known then he asked and hermione shrugged since fourth year when voldemort came back he and karkaroff she replied she wanted to tell him that snape really wasnta death eater but an agent for the order of the phoenix she wanted to tell him that he could still trust their potions master but due to draco unusually close ties to voldemort she knew it would be a risk that she was not yet willing to take it would endanger everything that the ootp had worked so hard and so long to establish but for just a second as she looked into his cold gray eyes she thought it would have been worth it to wash the sad tired look from his face he had no one to confide in anymore but for now she would have to be good enough she had to know that she could trust him and not come to regret it before she started sharing any deep life long secrets the nightmares if that is what they are will pass draco hermione soothed and draco nodded but that doesntmean you can just wear an invisibility cloak and go hiding places where people think they are alone she added with a slight smile and he laughed so you want to tell me how bad of a singer i am hermione asked and draco shook his head you re not bad if that what you mean you might want to choose a better selection of songs country isntmy type of music he replied and hermione shrugged oh not mine either she said quickly it just so happened that that day ginny was enjoying her lovely country music while we were studying the weasley likes country he asked i never took that family as the type to listen to cowboy crap but you cantreally judge by blood he finished and hermione shook her head no you can t she said but i guess that doesntkeep people from doing it she said sadly you mean people like me he asked said angrily well miss granger though you will no doubt deny it you do in fact judge me for my blood you automatically assume that whatever i do that may seem unsavory is because of my high station in pureblooded society well i tell you everything i do is of my own volition that rich you seemed to like using your father and the way you were raised as an excuse before why should i or anyone else believe otherwise draco smiled i ve been honest with you so far with scant detail and little of it was gained without slight or great coercion doesntcount you must take the initiative to form bonds yourself and without reason that is what trusting someone is all about draco and you my friend have not proven yourself trustworthy draco nodded then why do you trust me hermione paused opening her mouth to speak so you do let not make a grand spectacle of it i am sure you trust me in many ways that prior to our late camaraderie seemed quite impossible it did bother me draco said suddenly interrupting their volley of words and quipping comments what did hermione asked confused what happened after the dance hermione chest tightened as she thought of it yes what about it hermione inquired calmly she wasntabout to let on that what they had shared was still on her mind what happened between you and wease weasley he paused ready to let the weight fall hermione heart skipped a beat in disappointment of course it was about ron i lost one of my closest friends can you not understand why i would wish things to remain how they were ron has changed since what happened to his father and you are not completely innocent of the whole deal even if you werentthere your father was and ron cannot forgive as i do hermione said i know a different side of you than either ron or harry do i know that you are not a death eater but would you allow me to tell them that draco shook his head and why is that she asked knowing the answer it gives me power draco replied hoarsely and hermione nodded exactly it gives you power but in order for anything to go well for you you have to be able to relinquish some of that power she said and until you do you ll find yourself utterly alone but i not utterly alone he whispered but you are hermione sighed until you can let go of some of your control you will not trust and without trust you will find yourself empty and alone draco nodded slowly letting her words sink in i do trust you he looked at her his gray eyes searching for comforting words or thoughts i wouldnthave told you all this if i didn t yes you would have draco stop lying draco jumped do you even realize when you re doing it anymore or is it just a natural thing what the hell are you talking about i sit hear doing what you tell me to do spilling my guts to you and you re yelling at me draco shouted i dontknow what you want from me you ve seen me cry you ve seen me drunk you ve seen me caught in the throws of a romantic kiss that all fine and great draco but seeing those things means nothing to me if you doubt me and you do draco you do doubt me and that okay just stop lying she said quietly stop lying because someday i am going to believe you and you re going to let me down the last part she refused to let pass through her lips though she knew it made her a hypocrite whatever you sit here and confuse yourself draco snapped and he stood wrapping his invisibility cloak around him draco where are you hermione felt a draft of wind and the door to the small room slammed shut blowing out the candles she had lit along the wall hours earlier hermione sighed loudly now she was confusing herself yet another transition chapter and this one is way short but it gets to the point the next chapter shouldnttake long since i ve already written it out i just need to lengthen and revise it enjoy oh and whoever boom shaka laka is i appreciate the joke review anyone who wants a prime example of what a review is not for look at the last review i have received chapter 18 freaky fridays draco had woken angry was angry all day and he was hell bent on going to bed angry but as sometimes consciences do draco decided he would actually think everything through rationally before being pissy for a time period greater than twelve hours draco stood at the window of his dorm and stared out over the grounds it was just turning dark and the last remnants of the overly nice day were fading from the sky through some rather unscrupulous actions draco had obtained a very small cache of alcohol and he was loath to waste it all in one go as he had last time so the golden liquid sat glittering in the corner barely touched calling his name taking a swig from the single bottle in his hand draco groaned loudly this whole growing up thing was much more difficult than lucius had ever said it would be his father had never said anything about girls that made your heart beat so fast you could have sworn you were running lucius had never even mentioned the fact that sometimes the wrong decisions were made easy for a reason and the right ones were hard for another but the most disappointing thing that draco father had forgotten to inform draco about was even the possibility of this aching pain that he was constantly feeling it was an odd pang here or there right above his stomach and it was strange to think something so unrelated to the physical human body could cause such physical discomfort but among other things draco had learned from his father first and foremost lucius had taught him how to drink enough so that it didntmatter if one was in pain or not stupid granger and and her bushy brown hair he shouted at the wall slightly slurring his words together he may not have been drunk but he wasntsober the funny thing of it is that i being of pure blood and all that nonsense have less to my name than she does he whispered taking a large drink and finishing the bottle his urge for self control was ebbing and the more he looked at the small mountain of alcohol the more inviting it seemed to grow fuck it he said loudly while taking a step towards the beer i ll be damned if i bought it just to stare at it all night he said to himself might as well enjoy myself a little suddenly there was a soft tap on his door and draco froze damn it grabbing a single bottle from the small stack draco threw a cloak over the rest and walked to the door what he asked inclining his head forward a bit to hear through the door better as he twisted the top roughly from the bottle erm it me hermione she said and he could sense the discomfort in her voice despite his currently dulled senses and he questioned stupidly while putting the freshly opened bottle to his lips eager for the taste of england finest i wanted to speak with you about the documents his heart gave an involuntary lurch at her reply and he sighed he really needed to get a girl all right then reaching forward draco undid the lock single handedly and reached for the doorknob as he turned the brass sphere he felt the weight of someone leaning against the door but before he could press the door back a safe position he felt gravity take it toll hermione let out a short scream as she tumbled through the doorway and fell against draco hitting the floor with a soft thud draco felt the bottle slip from his hand and cringed as he heard the glass shatter against some other unknown hard object damn it he said while giving hermione a slight nudge off of him what the hell were you doing your ear pressed against my door like that you re fucking nosy you know that but hermione was laughing hysterically despite draco anger upon seeing that draco thought the situation was less than hilariously funny she quickly hushed and took up her uncomfortable attitude once again you spilt my beer he said bitterly and hermione stood i sure you have more she spat boy you are a pathetic wizard if i ever saw one i would repair it myself but as a prefect i do not wish to undermine hogwarts rules by helping you drink yourself into an early grave she paused thoughtfully you know like i said the last time we went through this whole i an alcoholic and i will drink whenever i damn well please situation i will once again state that alcohol is only a temporary means of escaping one problems ah know it all granger here to save the rich drunken fool once again if you make a habit of this i ll have to have you killed he said this as a joke but hermione didntseem to find it too funny so serious just a minute ago you wanted to laugh it up go on laugh at me he shouted laugh at the pathetic rich prefect but before draco could say another word hermione hand had made sharp contact with his left cheek stop pitying yourself draco you dontmake much of a martyr she commented dryly can you explain something to me he asked and hermione helped him stand despite the way he was treating her he was her friend and as of late she had felt quite compelled to be there for this troubled slytherin he was in rough waters and this she knew could be a difficult thing for any teenager but it was so much worse for someone unused to such trivial matters as human emotion and thought what she asked sitting him on the edge of his bed taking the seat from his study table hermione dragged it over to sit in front of his bed shut the door and sat down why is it that before we were friends when i looked at you i felt this great angry sickness but now now that we have been friends when i look at you i think about things such different things things i never even considered i i know that i saw you before but well now i see you he said slowly and hermione looked short on words you re not yourself draco perhaps we could talk later when you re a bit more sober and a lot angrier as you were i think you ve had a little too much friend hermione stated kindly but draco shook his head i ve only had two beers today a look of surprise crossed her face but soon it was masked by tinted cheeks and irregular nervous actions that he had come to notice of hermione now are you going to answer my question or just stare at me like i a nutter he asked i dontknow what to say hermione trailed off looking away say you feel it too tell me that i not insane he pleaded and she deliberately looked him in the eyes her brown irises staring through him with their innocence you canttruly expect me to have something to say straight off it not fair draco scoffed loudly fuck what fair granger do you think it fair that i have this unexplainable knot in my stomach constantly whenever you re around do you think it fair that even now after my father left me nothing i can never even consider you as anything other than a lesser species he asked his eyes narrowed in anger the alcohol had certainly freed his tongue and he was saying things he hadnteven thought about before this moment it a passing thing draco she said ignoring his comment about not getting a dime from his father it your subconscious mind telling you that girls and boys cannot have any kind of a platonic relationship and what you re feeling is a reaction to that she explained while looking at her hands this is merely a passing thing even i have had instances where i think that i like harry or even though i know we are just friends it unnatural for males and females to feel anything other than attraction with each other and that leads to confusion or that what she was hoping it more than my subconscious or i would be capable of dispelling you from my thoughts completely my father was not a stupid man and he taught me well if you had not wheedled your way into the most intimate sector of my conscious and subconscious self i would not be speaking to you now and you would still be my enemy as was naturally expected of the both of us draco said coolly well then why ask me hermione said suddenly her cheeks had grown hot and she felt shaky looking at him made her weak in the knees and thinking about their lips touching did even more i wanted to know if you felt anything but you have answered my question draco waved her out and hermione stood draco mimicked her action and saw her to the door where she stood uncomfortably are you angry hermione asked quietly with me why do you ask he asked leaning against the door frame relaxed because i miss you she whispered and what is it you miss he stepped forward slightly and hermione took a small barely noticeable step back while pointedly looking away your negative insight the way you hate everything despite its uses to you hermione replied i donthate everything per say draco said wistfully just things i dontunderstand and things that dontunderstand me you hate me then she asked their words had reached a point of bantering and at this point they both knew it was flirting no i think i have come to a very unique understanding of you miss granger and you i think have come to understand me quite well he said slowly you reek of alcohol draco she said and draco let out a chuckle and you expected less hermione smiled finally able to look him in the eyes losing herself as she had once before no i actually expected much more she said you dontlike it when i drink he stated blandly and hermione sighed i dontlike it when anyone drinks you should know this hermione replied caustically right i wontdrink anymore hermione guffawed unrealistic goal he asked with a smile and hermione nodded okay i wontdrink around you she nodded that a good goal will it get me another kiss he asked the smiles faded from their lips as they were shocked from their previously half serious state and draco cleared his throat well he began uncomfortably as he took a safe step away from hermione i should be getting some sleep i ll have to think of a clever way of disposing of the evidence you have created scourgefy hermione said and the beer bottle as well as its contents that were all over the floor disappeared in a flash of purplish light not creative at all hermione said as she opened the door we re all right then draco asked and hermione paused i wasntthe one who was angry draco she said and draco nodded we re okay he said after her and hermione shut the door behind her a content smile that draco did not see on her lips do you guys like the shorter chapters let me know well here it is chapter 19 the unforgivable curse draco watched in mild satisfaction as hermione once again let alias have it he vaguely heard the words they spoke to one another but it didntmatter the specifics once again alias had deserved it you wretched girl get out get out get out dark shouted and hermione packed her stuff away quietly a smile on her face my pleasure hermione said shortly as she hoisted her bag over her shoulder and headed to the door mr goyle make sure miss granger makes it to mcgonagall office in a timely fashion dark said and draco watched in terror as goyle rose and packed his own bag i ll go draco said quickly and alias smiled as if she knew what he was up to sorry but i do believe mr goyle is a little less invested in miss granger your judgment often seems clouded when in the presence of the girl whereas his judgment is nearly nonexistent dark replied and draco held back the urge to start a new yelling match between himself and alias draco knew why dark had sent goyle and the truth of it sent his insides writhing with apprehension no doubt goyle would do his job but not without a great many incidents that would no doubt cause a fair amount of pain for hermione along the way may i use the bathroom draco asked and alias sighed glaring in his direction as if she wished to catch fire to his head i not stupid mr malfoy you will be staying put until this class is dismissed and if i hear as much as another peep out of you until then i will have your skin as a window drape dark shouted like a madwoman clenching her fists and many people around the room gasped giving a false chuckle alias clapped her hands together and faced the front where her lesson board was pulled out a little joke to loosen the tension just the trick eh she growled with a twisted smile on her face that was obviously forced draco watched as goyle left the classroom and all he could do was hope hermione ran fast turning back to his parchment draco resumed taking notes and when the bell finally rang he shoved everything hurriedly into his bag and ran out the door as he rushed out of the classroom the toe of draco shoe caught on something and falling forward draco curled away from the floor to brace himself for the impact his back hit the floor with a tremendous amount of force and draco felt his breath wrenched from his body as he gasped in pain shit he muttered while he got to his knees looking back he noticed a small crowd around the entrance to alias dark classroom standing draco pushed his way through the gathering of gawking students until he found the source of their awe gregory goyle lay on the stone floor his flesh was pale and his eyes glassed over in death suddenly there was screaming and shouting and draco watched in slow motion as everything went to chaos first years and seventh years alike were running about madly trying to find out what this meant but draco knew there was a student at hogwarts who had used the unforgivable curse on another student voldemort war had spilled into the hallway of one of the safest places in the wizarding world which meant there was no safe place anymore through the screaming and shouting one thought crossed draco mind hermione she had been out of class when this happened get to your dormitories students prefects prefects this way shouted the two loud voices of the head boy and head girl get out of the hallway prefects follow me it was then that draco made a dangerous decision he knew that he couldntwait to know if she was okay he had to know then he didntthink he could take finding out she was dead by waiting in the prefect lounge the foreboding feeling he got from his dreams returned filling his stomach with lead walking away from the yelling of the head boy and head girl draco made his way through the great hall full of running fleeing frightened students to the main staircase deserted and threatening everything about walking up this staircase felt wrong to draco but he knew he had to make it to mcgonagall office just to know if she had made it there malfoy what in hell name are you doing asked a cold voice from the base of the steps i need to find granger draco said turning to face his potion master you need to do what you have been told to do malfoy and you need to do it right now you are putting more lives in danger than just yours and mine snape motioned for draco to come with him but draco shook his head i dontfollow death eaters any longer he shouted and sprinted up the staircase he could hear that snape was following him but he didntcare running through corridor after corridor he found not one sign of hermione but instead of relief draco felt more desperate malfoy you re making a stupid mistake snape called after draco a corridor behind i know where she is she safe draco stopped in his tracks bent over leaning on his knees and allowed himself to pant where is she he asked in between great gulping breaths he heard snape approaching quickly by the tap tap tap of his teacher perfectly shined boots across the floor of stone she is with dumbledore you stupid boy snape said he was breathing almost as hard as draco was and draco sighed sliding to the floor did she of course not she wasnteven near the classroom when it happened snape said following suit you should be worried about your dead housemate and what his death means for you draco not some gryffindor who holds not even one known ancestor to her name snape spat suddenly and what exactly does goyle death mean for me draco asked he wanted to be nowhere near the death eater but did not have the energy to move away only to glare and hate your father rank is not enough to protect you from voldemort blind wrath snape replied knowingly and draco shrugged it wasntvoldemort who killed goyle professor draco said shortly and snape gave a small chuckle that is my point boy snape said with a bitter smile forming on his sallow gloomily set face there is one among you who does not fear the wrath of any other but his lord snape growled you need to be cautious with the image of where your loyalties lie whether it is with your slytherins or with your gryffindor he spat gryffindor like it was a swearword and draco recoiled it must appear as though you are the son of a death eater things must appear as they always have even if that means reestablishing some of your more distasteful ties among your house coming from you this advice seems somewhat ironic draco said quietly but i trust your words for they are common sense and i have need for something strong and concrete nothing is concrete malfoy being a part of your father house i would have expected you to have learned this long ago snape said while getting to his feet now the prefects are all meeting in the kitchens go there and do not speak of miss granger she is a suspect currently you dontact like a death eater draco said suddenly and snape laughed a low mirthless laugh that chilled draco and made him doubt the truth of his words things change mr malfoy and alliances shift constantly thus is the dance of politics and life alike snape held out his hand and draco reached for it you should know it but granger is not your only resource you can come to me any time you wish and dumbledore is also available to those who need him snape hoisted draco to his feet and motioned for draco to follow him there will be a meeting held in the great hall this night and there will be danger to you protect yourself snape sped up and draco did not bother speeding his own gate he slowly retraced his steps back down the stairs and only after he had wandered aimlessly for ten minutes did he realize he had no idea where the kitchens were shit draco exclaimed as he ran a shaky hand through his soft silvery hair where the fu mr malfoy what a surprise to see you out wandering the halls when you as a prefect are supposed to be in the kitchens receiving instructions said the slippery voice of alias dark arentthe teachers supposed to be in a meeting of their own draco asked his voice filled with malice he had formerly kept in check when in the presence of his dada professor that is none of your concern she said slowly and draco nodded not turning his head an inch where re the kitchens draco asked with a sigh of frustration down that corridor the painting of fruit tickle the pear she whispered in his ear and draco leapt away she had been some distance away when she had first spoken and in just seconds she had approached him posing a threat to his person right i should be going he said yes the best idea you ve had in a while draco dark hissed and draco backed slowly away her purple eyes glittered in malice as he walked away unable to turn his back on her fear me she mouthed and draco turned away running full speed down the corridor stopping in front of a painting of a bowl of fruit draco looked at it tickle the fucking pear fucking ridiculous he cursed only dumbledore and only at hogwarts draco muttered indignantly reaching up draco felt stupid but tickled the pair letting out a giggle the pear turned into a doorknob and draco twisted it entering the kitchens quietly malfoy where have you been asked the sixth year hufflepuff known as albert knockterth shove it and mind your own fucking business knocktooth said draco i got a bit lost he explained in a dark tone where timothy draco asked inquiring after the new fifth year prefect we thought you two were in hiding together said a ravenclaw in the corner and draco threw the girl a mean vicious glare that made her cower he was back what were we supposed to think she asked slytherins dontkill slytherins draco replied now what re you all doing draco asked albert shrugged they told us to come here and think of a game plan we haventhad any bursts of inspiration and considering most of us dontknow what the hell happened it quite impossible to expect anything useful stop whining and use your brain has anybody got any useful tidbits of information draco asked and saw weasley slowly raise his hand what weasel goyle was killed by the adavra kadavra curse weaselby muttered and draco smiled that preposterous weasley everyone knows that the adavra kadavra curse is one of the unforgivable cur it true i saw his body draco interrupted now we just have to think of how to weed out the culprit so is he who must not be named here at hogwarts asked a fifth year gryffindor dontbe dense it was a student there no other possibility weasley said and draco nodded yes it was a student but how to find out which student that is the real problem here eh draco asked a playful smile on his lips not really i figure the questioning wouldnthave to go further than this room weasley commented dryly more specifically beyond you malfoy you may think acting useful will fool us but we see through you like a piece of saran wrap interesting simile you re clever i ll give you that question me as you will you ll find that my hands are as clean of this as they always have been draco replied jauntily i was thinking we could suggest to the higher ups that during the meeting that is to be held in the great hall this evening we all have our wands put under the scrutiny of the reverse spell draco offered and there were murmurs of hesitant agreement around the room priori incantatem someone uttered and draco clapped loudly yes at least some of us have learned something here in all these years yes priori incantatem should be adequate enough to weed out the culprit you cantavoid it and you canthide what you ve done with your wand draco said excitedly this spell will tell of the last spells performed with it thus betraying its owner doesntthat damage the wand asked the ravenclaw and draco shrugged dead wand dead human which is more important he asked and even if it does cause damage it got to be minimal or else the ministry wouldntuse it and there would be a lot of unhappy and wandless wizards out there which there aren t i agree said a hufflepuff draco didntrecognize and there were murmurs of agreement so that it we have our game plan draco said what re we supposed to do now wait the hufflepuff said and draco sighed draco hated waiting he wondered what granger was doing suddenly the door to the kitchens burst open and snape stood in the doorway all students are to report to the great hall prefects you need to sit separate from your houses and we need ideas priori incantatem draco replied shortly as he pushed snape aside and began the walk to the great hall with a pang of worry he hoped that granger would meet them for the meeting this wasntsomething for her image sake she should miss sitting at a table to the far right and front of the teacher table draco looked out over the mass of students that had fearfully and quickly gathered they were all awaiting information that had before now been denied them despite draco prayers that hermione would show she did not and this worried him further not many knew about the convenient coincident but those who did eagerly expected hermione to come and take claim to her innocence and if she didntshow up at all she obviously wasntinnocent standing draco felt hands on his shoulders sit down mr malfoy said mcgonagall voice she ll be along shortly the woman said and draco did sit down but not because of what mcgonagall said but because just in that instant he saw hermione walk through the doors in the great hall draco immediately noticed her tousled windblown appearance and deducted that a walk from hogsmeade in mid winter could do that so he allowed the tense muscles of his shoulders to loosen i cantbelieve this she said quietly as she sat down next to draco in the seat that he had taken great care to assure it remained empty what exactly about it is unbelievable it was all bound to happen i dontknow why we are all as surprised as we are he said darkly and hermione lip quivered one of your housemates is dead draco she said quietly her voice filled with slight scorn someone in this school used the unforgivable curse to kill him and you are acting as nonchalant as if a distant aunt on your mother side has died the war is here in hogwarts she said and draco sighed and i knew it would be just as you did the war was already here hermione but before it was conducted outside the walls how many of your house have gone missing or have been killed in the past two years he asked and hermione looked down as she thought four four gryffindors two slytherins two ravenclaws and one hufflepuff in the past two years odd isntit that before potter saw voldemort rise that there were no murders no students that went missing no students that were caught in bands of death eaters torturing a muggle family he asked and hermione nodded he back and he playing the same game we have to be smarter though stronger hermione nodded i glad you re on our side this time she said slowly and draco shrugged her comment easily off i ve never been on anybody side besides my own dontexpect that to change he said coolly and hermione attention was drawn to the front of the room where their fake headmaster now stood motioning for silence today is a grave day at hogwarts suddenly with a great gust of wind the doors to the great hall opened and there stood dumbledore in his long blue robes looking out at them over his half moon spectacles the vision to them all seemed unreal in its epic appearance no need kromeen no need anymore i am back dumbledore said finally and there were boos amongst a hall full of cheers draco felt his fears lessen as the wizened man walked to the front and took their headmaster place today is a grave day for hogwarts and i will not sugar coat any of it for you there has been a murder in our halls this day something that has never before happened and the person who has committed this murder will be punished to the full extent of law of age or not the old man said slowly in his serious voice that they rarely heard before beginning the test you shall all undertake i would like to first take a moment to remember the dead gregory goyle a moment of silence and a shout for him please a moment passed and dumbledore let out a shout saying goyle name few followed suit now that those who wish to respect him have had their chance we shall begin the test that cannot fail the first thought that came to mind for our task was a drought of veritaserum but then i realized the substance could easily be manipulated dumbledore said and many people let out sighs of relief but there is another thing we may do one that cannot be falsified and one that is irreversible in its projections dumbledore paused and still there was silence there are four hundred thirty seven of you in this room and i expect that before you all go back to your dorms tonight there will be four hundred forty seven wands in a neat pile at your head of house table murmurs of worry echoed through the hall and draco smirked priori incantatem draco shouted aloud and dumbledore turned to give draco a look of pride yes all of your wands will be cast under the priori incantatem spell and this will reveal who has done one of the unforgivable curses dumbledore cast a weary glance around the room and sighed please do not struggle i tire of strife take this time to step forward and give your head of house your wand they will mark your name and account for the presence of your wand that is all dumbledore stumbled back into his seat and watched as everything took place draco and hermione stood in unison and pulled their wands from their robes without hesitation whereas others around them paused uncertainly do it hermione said do what he says unless you have something to hide from dumbledore you should not hesitate draco nodded and walked to snape table where he set his wand down proudly yes mr malfoy thank you go take your seat and wait to be dismissed snape said coolly and draco did as he was told for once not putting up a fight back at their table he met hermione you re right he said sullenly as they sat and hermione smiled what is it i right about this time she asked playfully though her eyes betrayed her weariness i haventtried very hard to be trusted he replied stormily as a bitter smile tugged at the corners of his mouth i knew i was right about that hermione said seriously and draco nodded are you going back to the prefect dormitories or are you going to tough it out with your brethren in this time of grief i cantsleep in the slytherin dorms he said adamantly and hermione turned a questioning glance towards him why not because the person that killed goyle will be there and that puts my life in danger draco said without the slightest touch of fear in his voice how do you know it was a slytherin hermione asked believe me you know your housemates handiwork draco said with a slightly proud smirk and to answer her surprised expression he said like i ve said many a time before hermione we know what each and every housemate is capable of for us suspicion is the code of honor and if one fails to observe this one ends up either dead or with an awful curse on him every time he turns around that terrible it doesnteven sound like a house hermione exclaimed it sounds like a bunch of snakes thrown into a cage now you re getting it draco said with a smile so now you know why i like to avoid baring my neck for every person that passes with a knife in their hand draco asked and hermione nodded that still doesn we re being dismissed hermione draco interrupted and she turned around to see everyone standing you should probably hurry you re not exactly the most wanted person tonight but you re pretty damn close what do you mean they dontthink i she stopped as she saw draco nod and she hurried to the door i ll see you later then maybe they opened the doors to the great hall and hermione was shoved through the doorway by the mass crowd behind her they were all tired and wanted some relief from all this strangeness going on around them draco rose from his seat and followed near the back of the crowd head lowered draco made his way slowly to the stairway that led to the upper corridors upon reaching the top stair draco heard an odd sound coming from the corridor that led to the prefect dormitories it sounded like shouting and draco sped up suddenly draco turned the corner and what he saw and heard couldnthave been more shocking chapter 20 the stairs and the deadly mistake she killed him the gryffindor slut did it shouted a female at the foot of the stairs her hood was pulled over her head so draco could not recognize the one who spoke but the slippery and malicious tone in her voice was familiar draco ran forward and was lost among a sea of slytherins hermione was on the last stair of the staircase that led to the astronomy tower and she had her hands on her hips and the look on her face told him that she was ready to tell them all of she obviously found the situation less serious than it was draco could tell from the heated way the slytherins all around him whispered and hissed at one another that this was a very serious matter they were threatening hermione and she didnteven see the threat i ll have you know draco watched as her expression suddenly changed from blatant outrage to a strange look of confusion mingled with fear if draco wondered what was happening his question was answered only a second later as the staircase became fully separated from the wall the force of the movement caused hermione to lose her footing before she could jump safely to the other side and draco watched in a dreamlike state as she dangled by one hand from the railing there was silence for a moment before to draco horror cheers rose and words of such violence and hatred were uttered that draco could hear the electricity pulse through the air around him draco saw hermione attempt slowing her breathing to restore calm but this tactic failed miserably and he saw the signs of wild panic on the lines of her soft delicate features her eyes wide hermione turned to the crowd of slytherins that were watching and pleaded pathetically for help draco felt a strange stirring in his stomach that he knew as empathy but found himself unable to make the decision to step forward and help help help crying isntgoing to get you anywhere princess we re here to avenge the death of a slytherin and slytherins dontback down when you bat your lashes now draco knew the voice so pansy i see you re at it again draco called and the hooded girl at the front turned meeting draco cold glare with one of her own come to watch eh she asked with a smirk no sorry draco but the gryffindor girlfriend has to go she become quite the annoyance for us for you you donthave to work with the girl for hour upon hour in an enclosed space that reeks of mudblood draco words ignited a flame in hermione eyes and he knew they had done their work worked their magic i ve been waiting for a chance to do this myself but her gryffindorks are always around her really this was a chance meeting actually though it would have been a grand idea pansy said and draco nodded in the back of his mind he heard hermione whimper as her palm became sweaty and began to lose traction looking on draco watched and he could read what was going on behind her eyes like she was a book she feared her hand would slip and upon trying to grasp the rail with her other hand she loosened her steady grip more quickly her voice was quiet now as if she feared that any noise at all would be the last straw please she whispered fearfully pathetic isntit pansy asked draco and his eyes were locked on hermione he risked exposing himself to pansy if he moved to help her but if he didnthelp hermione he would be responsible for the death of a friend the death of someone he realized he liked as more than just a friend this thought process seemed to bring draco to life move he shouted as he parted the crowd of spectator slytherins that seemed to be enjoying the scene get out of my way he pushed past crabbe and then pansy draco reached the edge of the platform and looked ahead the staircase was a little more than six feet from him and he looked for a secondary solution to the one he had in mind but found none pansy grabbed the sleeve of his robe and yanked him back away from the edge how dare you she shouted you re not a slytherin at all canteven stomach a little muggle torture she said with an outraged expression on her face she not a muggle he said and even if she was one she d probably be able to do better magic than you he said ripping his sleeve from her grasp if you do this think what you will be losing pansy hissed in a low dangerous tone and what would that be your friends your pride your purpose she said actually by doing this thing i think i d be gaining those things back he said turning back to face the problem at hand here goes he thought and there were gasps and outbursts of anger as he launched himself into the air using full leg power he reached his arms out in front of him and barely caught the railing opposite to hermione it had begun to rotate draco gained leverage on the stone and slowly inched his way to the front of the stairs where there was no railing his energy began to wane and he found himself breathing heavily draco could see hermione and a new jet of exhilaration burst forth from his veins her lips were moving in silent prayer as she held on as tightly as she could he reached the front and tried to gain footing but with a pang of foreboding he misplaced his foot and slipped there were loud cat callings and gasps as he almost released his grip but to his and everyone else surprise he found his footing once again he decided that he was done tempting fate and pulled himself up with a heave and a groan of exertion taking a moment to gain his breath angry shouts could be heard but he paid them no attention his focus was on how he was going to save hermione life she hadnteven realized someone was trying to save her yet and the look on her face said that she had resigned herself to whatever fate awaited her draco saw her flex her hand to renew the grip and she screamed as her hand slipped a little more it was time for action he reached his hand out towards her and bent forward onto his knees hermione take my hand hermione snapped to attention and without hesitation reached for his hand just as draco was able to wrap his hand around hermione the staircase began to shift upward suddenly as hermione grip was lost draco was hit with the full force of her weight which flung him forwards forcing one knee over the edge now all that separated hermione from the darkness below was draco whose silvery platinum hair framed his face that was unusually pale draco held on tight using all of his strength while making sure to keep his grip on the railing as well as hermione hand as long as he could manage but panicking hermione began to struggle and draco groaned while he tried to hold her steady hermione hermione dontstruggle he said but she paid no heed i will not let you fall hermione went still looking upward at her rescuer she nodded fearfully it all right he said through gritted teeth just hold on by now teachers were lined up on the platform below and draco realized just how close they were to the new platform it was only feet away from crushing hermione small body into the stone wall behind them this made him want to be somewhere else what if he failed to save her and he watched as the walls moved in looking down once again draco saw that the group of slytherins was now completely silent he assumed it wasntjust because of the presence of the teachers no he knew they were watching in anticipation for him to falter draco tried as hard as he could to keep his footing and he slowly began to pull her upwards failure is not an option draco let out a groan as he tugged a final time and pulled hermione onto the stairs with him both of them falling over draco held hermione close to him for she was finally letting that panic affect her i could of died she said shakily it was so close she lips quivered and tears began to spill from her eyes thank you thank you thank you she said as she grasped his shirt and pushed her head against his sturdy chest wrapping his tired arms around her draco tucked her head under his chin and sighed you really have to pay attention he said a hint of banter in his voice and hermione pulled away and slapped his arm and you just standing there having a casual vulgar conversation with another girl i should have known you were trouble she said shaking her head and wiping her tears away i could say the same thing for you snape going to kill me you know he said with a groan shit shit shit what am i going to do stand up for yourself what could they possibly d miss parkinson you were supposed to relinquish your wand to professor snape said professor flitwick and his voice suggested that he had had enough of whatever was going on at hogwarts i going to kill him the filthy little bastard he a traitor to his family and he a traitor to his house pansy shouted and draco stood looking over the railing he ducked just as a jet of blue light flew towards him and he reached into his pockets realizing snape had his wand miss parkinson put the wand down avada kadavra she shouted and draco saw the spell make contact with the rail spoke right next to hermione head i should kill them both the filthy mudblood and the traitor avada kadavra draco pushed hermione away from the edge and she let out a short scream as the spell missed her head by inches passing so close that the little hairs on the back of her neck stood on end i killed that stupid git goyle for less draco he told me not to kill you though he might get angry as if rethinking her rash decision pansy let her wand arm drop to her side and draco braved a look over the railing again come on hermione draco said taking her by the arm we ve got to get down there she going to try to get away how do you kno i know her hermione now shut up and hurry draco shouted half the school wandless and she going to get away though i doubt even pansy that stupid even if she does try to get away i sure the teachers can handle it draco some of them have hundreds of years of experience hermione reassured as she hurried down the corridor side by side with the boy that had saved her life running down a flight of stairs draco took the lead and now he could guiltlessly jump ahead by sprinting reaching the platform draco almost sprinted right into dumbledore who was calmly talking with pansy back off you old fool let me by or i ll blow half your staff including yourself to hell pansy shrieked i ve already killed for him and you can bet your life that i ll do it again he manipulated you why does everything have to be manipulation with you aurors pansy spat a disgusted look on her face because dumbledore began that is what voldemort does he lies and fabricates what were you offered to be his creature in my school his countenance and nothing less not that it any of your business she said suddenly pansy smiled a wicked smiled and turned her eyes to draco he knows what it like to be in the dark lord favor but he threw it away i wontmake that mistake she whispered and despite what you think old man you poor old fool every creature of voldemort has a way out in your school she spat dropping the wand pansy sprinted to the side and ran full speed down the side corridor that no one had bothered to guard making a split second decision draco pushed dumbledore aside and jolted after her his legs may have been short but he was fast and in shape mr malfoy don t shouted the sullen voice of snape she gets away and we re all in danger draco shouted over his shoulder turning his attention to the task at hand draco paced himself though he could still see pansy it seemed as though she knew more about the school than even he did or maybe she was just frantic she didntknow where she would end up but remembering her words draco doubted it shit draco said as pansy turned a corner putting on a sudden burst of speed to lose him there draco though his lungs screamed for oxygen matched her stride for stride and eventually she was close enough to grab reaching out with an unsteady hand draco grabbed the arm of her cloak and bowled them both over pansy had expected this and rolled herself to let her shoulder absorb the force of the fall hitting the floor with a loud crack draco let out a loud curse there was no doubt about it his arm was broken pansy stood brushing off her cloak and stared down at him a look of near loathing twisting her almost attractive appearance but suddenly her face was lacking its beauty that he had seen before she had lost any semblance of youth these past months now you ll know what it like to disappoint your master she said with a smile not before i strangle you with my bare hands draco growled through clenched teeth have you ever heard the phrase twisting someone arm draco pansy asked with a grin i not afraid of you the only advantage you have at the moment is the fact that you re standing draco grimaced as pansy sat on her haunches beside him reached forward and applied pressure to his injured arm you might want to have mudblood kiss it better before you go strangling people draco there was the sound of muffled steps and shouts down the corridor and pansy looked up and over like a deer caught in headlights i ll have to leave you here pansy said as if there had been another option but i will be back i can guarantee that you ll be hearing a lot about pansy parkinson hopefully it your obituary pansy smiled with a chuckle and stood you re the one who made a deadly mistake she said with a smile little does your headmaster know there a backdoor to every castle and then pansy was off running towards the tapestry on the far wall giving draco a short wave and a salute she disappeared beneath the fold of the tapestry after she was gone draco realized how badly his arm hurt there was a tingling sensation in his fingertips and as he tried to move he felt a heaviness on his mind blackness was only a blink away mr malfoy draco heard it but he didntsee it mr malfoy draco closed his eyes and gave into the sweet black of unconsciousness draco woke a distant groggy feeling to his head he felt as if he had forgotten something something important the tapestry he shouted opening his eyes as he sat up the tapestry she used the tapestry mr malfoy please lean back lest you lose me my privilege of sitting with you for a bit said the soft and airy voice of their headmaster headmaster she used the tapestry to get away she said something about a back door he said frantically trying to rise we looked in every possible place and i assure you there is no trace of miss parkinson mr malfoy now do as i say and lean back before i pour some tranquilizer potion down your throat myself dumbledore said and he wasntjoking gone was the light undertone in this man voice how did she get a wand draco asked taking his defeat quite gracefully considering there was one wand we did not consider when we made our headcount dumbledore said slowly goyle s draco said and dumbledore nodded mr goyle s where hermione draco asked suddenly and dumbledore let out a soft laugh that sounded all too familiar for the slytherin comfort she sleeping he said pointing a finger towards a chair in the corner where hermione sat head leaned against the backing her eyes closed in deep sleep he saw that someone had placed a blanket over her and she seemed content enough draco made to get up but dumbledore pushed him back down she should stay that way for another hour or so as should you you re arm was broken in two places and it was a rough night for you last night night i spent the night in the hospital wing draco asked his mouth falling open in shock yes and madame pomfrey said you thrashed around quite a bit she convinced you ll need to stay another night just to be sure you re all right dumbledore said with a smile i not staying here for another night in fact i quite convinced i am fine and should be getting up now draco sat up and began shoving the comforter aside dumbledore held up a small bottle and lightly shook its contents to remind draco of his former threat it either you stay in bed of your own volition or you stay in bed of my volition he said slowly and draco let out a loud angry sigh as he heaved himself back into a comfortable position there you go now good man good man dumbledore began to cough and draco flinched as the old man turned away hacking deeper and deeper until madam pomfrey came in and took him by the arm it about time you let me give you an examination headmaster said the woman and dumbledore waved her away woman i am fine just a bit of a chest cold dumbledore insisted and draco saw a stirring in the chair out of the corner of his eye leave me be or i ll come in here every afternoon and visit all your patients he threatened with a laugh for goodness sakes what is it going to take for me to convince you chest colds dontlast for weeks and weeks and weeks she asked after him and dumbledore walked to the door there will be another time for this conversation poppy but right now you have two charges who are very awake and coherent you may want to fix that madam pomfrey let out a sigh and placed her hands on her hips go one then if they are going to sleep you will have to be gone go one go on dumbledore laughed heartily as he was forced out of his own hospital wing and when madam pomfrey came by his bedside draco smiled sweetly up at her yawning he said i dontthink i ll need any more sleeping drought thank you but she shook her head and measure out the proper dose no you don t that potter pulled that twice this year saying he going to sleep all on his own and then i come back in and he gone no where to be found she said handing him the cup there ll be none of that nonsense from you mr malfoy i rarely see you in here for genuine purposes so enjoy and drink up at least you wonthave to be going to school for the next few days yeah because that what i worried about he growled and she motioned him to stop talking and drink the drought fine fine get off my back already he downed the nasty vile drink and looked up at her a grimace on his face not bad eh has the hint of strawberries i always thought she said while she moved on to hermione in the corner yeah the kind that are fermenting he whispered he looked to his right throwing a glance at hermione who was kindly refusing to take the drought but before he could even focus on her familiar face he felt the drought going to work his mind grew heavy again and his ability to hold his head weakened until he gave up trying and just looked to the ceiling but every time he blinked he saw her until finally as it worked its way diligently through his bloodstream he closed his eyes and let sleep drift over him he knew it to be the dead of night but he heard his name being called over and over again getting up from his bed draco moved to the window and looked out over the grounds looking for the source of the anguished screams draco it called again and draco turned to the door twisting the doorknob he realized it must be locked but the voice was just outside the door did no one else hear it draco please draco pushed his palms over his ears in an attempt to block the screaming it was going to wake hermione walking to the corner draco lifted the blue blanket only to find that hermione was no longer there draco it shouted and draco felt his heart stop he knew that voice almost as well as he knew this dream hermione he shouted but there was no answer running back to the door he wiggled the knob frantically hermione open the door it locked from the inside he shouted but she just kept screaming and screaming in agony hermione open the fucking door he yelled at the top of his lungs draco stop it i canthelp you unless you open the door the screaming went on for what seemed like hours before it suddenly stopped apparently draco had fallen to his knees and standing draco pressed his ear against the door hermione he whispered grabbing the knob once again he tried to twist it except this time it opened with a loud click searching for his wand he realized yet again that snape had it and he was defenseless walking down the corridor slowly draco made his way to the stairs peering over the railing he saw a long shadow sprint from the corner to the front door where it slipped out through a small crack in the door with a pang of fear draco realized the shadow was leading him stepping slowly down each stair draco made a great effort to keep his other senses alert he could hear his heart pounding in his ears and he tried to calm himself it seemed so loud that he was sure whatever was stalking him could hear it draco opened the door with a loud creak and stepped through the opening he was now on the outside and it was surprisingly warm outside the stars hovered menacingly above him and the grass seemed to harbor a danger that draco could only sense not see with a prayer of resolve draco stepped forward onto the grass and found it stable enough to trust seeing the shadow swim through the grass ahead draco trudged on his eyes suspiciously roaming every shadow every movement but the night was surprisingly still as draco followed the shadow he saw that they were nearing the forbidden forest he knew what awaited him there death death was in the forest but he could not stray from the path he had to keep going because the shadow knew where hermione was and draco needed to find hermione entering the thick of the forest draco found himself plunged into darkness there was now movement all around him there were also noises strange noises and voices that were calling his name dragging him further into their midst hermione draco uttered quietly and suddenly there was an uproar you have to go draco nothing but death awaits you here said hermione soft voice and draco turned to find himself face to face with her but she was glowing transparent a shade of what she used to be go he ll be here soon and you dontwant to meet him she said come back with me dumbledore can fix this draco voice trailed off as hermione shook her head slowly not even a wizard can bring the dead back to life draco now go you haventmuch time draco nodded then shook his head i not leaving you here it not safe he said i dead they canthurt me anymore draco draco nodded again and turned he was suddenly face to face with the same creature he always met here but this time because hermione was behind him he could see its face the large red eyes and crystal teeth and then it struck him as it always did and he was helpless to prevent the onslaught of teeth and venom draco said a soft voice draco wake up madam says we can leave now draco felt the lightest pressure on his chest and opened his eyes a minuscule amount just so he could see who was waking him sitting up draco looked into hermione chocolate brown eyes and sighed a sigh of the utmost relief you re beautiful he said slowly then he pushed aside the comforter and stood grabbing his cloak from the rack by the door draco placed it over his shoulder and left not looking back to see the look of shock on hermione face forgive me the tests are newt not owls i made a mistake so sorry so when your read owl think newt chapter 21 odd ponderings of a wayward gryffindor hermione entered her history of magic class with much more than guinivere the witch queen and merlin the wizard on her mind and as she sat in her normal seat she waited contentedly for the warning bell to ring maybe with a little education going on she would be able to think clearly two seconds before the final bell rang she noticed ron and harry enter the room as if searching for an answer harry stopped in front of hermione and turned his eyes down at her nodding with a weak smile hermione scooted to the end of the table so that harry and ron could seat themselves are you and ron ready to be on speaking terms harry asked in a mock frustrated voice with a sigh he driving me crazy with all this i saw hermione today she looked okay crap already i haventsaid that once ron protested his ears turning red geez someone mentions someone else healthy skin tone and you ll never hear the end of it ron mumbled with a brooding look well harry asked is he going to be civil hermione asked i not your go between ask him yourself harry muttered darkly while he pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill to take notes with ron are you going to be civil she asked and ron guffawed i not the one fraternizing with the enemy ron said and hermione sighed so all slytherins are our enemies she asked and ron nodded enthusiastically as he pulled his textbook from his bag yep that just about sums everything up shoot hermione exclaimed as she rummaged through her bag i must have forgotten my book she said and when she looked up both ron and harry were gaping open mouthed at her can it be ron gasped feigning a heart attack hermione sighed and harry let a touch of concern find its way into his words you forgot your quill too what up with you lately hermione i ve never seen you so scatterbrained harry commented with a worried expression you can use one of mine hermione ron said quickly and hermione brushed him off with a gesture that not important not important ron asked harry i think this one under the imperius curse i do ron said with a smile but harry didntsmile back right so what the matter with you ron inquired i have a lot on my mind is all hermione said and the first thought that popped into her head was a platinum blond slytherin like what i take it dumbledore been doing damage control eh none of you have heard about pansy hermione asked and both ron and harry looked oblivious i heard she was killed in a heated game of exploding snaps by well you know the usual suspect ron said his voice trailing off in discomfort what happened harry asked while giving ron a look of disdain that expressed his idea about ron idea hermione gave a furtive look to professor binns who continued droning on and on despite the fact that the three students in the front row were talking quietly amongst themselves all right yesterday and hermione told ron and harry every detail of what had happened leaving out a few choice details that she wished to keep to herself for at least another day all that happened and no one has a clue harry asked hermione nodded and he shook his head i wonder why dumbledore wouldnttell us he never kept anything like this from us before maybe it because she got away all the more reason for us to know dontyou think harry interrupted ron who shrugged all i know is that whatever is really going on none of us have really got a clue if dumbledore isntsaying anything about it hermione said as she began copying notes in a hurry i thinking we should lay low for a while and not doing any blatant investigation before harry could interrupt her hermione changed the subject harry can you be a dear and turn your book this was just a notch so how are the slytherins taking malfoy great betrayal ron said with a sarcastic lilt to his voice i sure they re fairing well enough draco growled under his breath as the sixth piece of parchment this class hit him in the back of the head as he tried to study for their transfiguration quiz next class mr crabbe i am not joking with you the next piece of parchment that finds itself projectile in my room will not only cause you great grief but also your house mcgonagall threatened for the third time and draco sighed the ravenclaws laughed and whispered behind their hands and the only solace draco found during the entire class was found when he delved into his mind for memories of hermione or studied but studying was more urgent and he had to stop dwelling for that was what it was looking up front he watched mcgonagall teach and was absorbed in her words it was another lesson his father had taught him and words that had lain dormant in his mind for what seemed like years resurfaced even when one has other things on his mind he need not let his conscious dwell on it for more often than not his subconscious is ripping it to shreds for later more appropriate times of dwelling draco felt a shudder pass through him at the thought of his father lessons but covered it with an uncomfortable position shift its is only when a wizard finds himself in dire need that he would think of using such a spell on himself mcgonagall said and draco realized her voice had refocused itself animaguses are very dangerous when they are unregistered and by due process of law any unregistered animagus may be prosecuted haventwe already gone over all this draco asked bitterly as he brushed a few crusted specs of ink from his page and mcgonagall smiled the only reason we go over this now is because you all are almost of age mr malfoy and young men and women sometimes think themselves above any law that may get in the way of some of their fun she said we are trying to force it into your brains what a serious law you would be breaking if you ever attempted such a transformation it is dangerous to as you the law breaker as well as the rest of the wizarding world she said is it hard to become an animagus asked a ravenclaw from the back and draco studies mcgonagall face intently it took me the greater part of seven years to go through the entire process and at this point in time there are still difficulties i encounter every transformation she replied with a smile everything a wizard does relies in at least some way on the environment a shiver due to abnormal cold or fear could cause a temporary mutation that could risk your life make you vulnerable to a great many elements that would otherwise be found outside your spectrum miss charleston will this be on our test asked a softly irish accented female voice behind draco that he recognized as heather holley s you could bet your life on it holley i hope you ve all written extensive notes for we are about to enjoy a pop quiz mcgonagall said while clapping her hands together with a wave of her wand the papers were distributed around the classroom shit draco whispered to himself damn hermione damn his father draco read through the questions and when his quiz was completed he did not allow his mind to wander hermione leaned her chin on an open palm and stared at the chalkboard flitwick was frantically trying to prepare them for some great task he was going to give them but hermione found she didnthave the capacity to care her head had been in the clouds all day and nothing was going to change this all she could focus on was the next time she would see malfoy and this was becoming quite the grievance considering who her company was all day long miss granger is something bothering you asked the nervous squeaky voice of their professor and hermione stifled a yawn as she shook her head no you see out of it he said and hermione shrugged i feel all right she said slowly and harry nudged her roughly in the ribs with his elbow i great what re we doing she asked and a look of pure terror spread on the professor face the owl are so near miss granger you need to focus oh i never thought i d say that to you of all people he exclaimed and hermione fought a pang of guilt as it settled in her stomach i sorry i left my color coded note cards in my other bag hermione hissed and ron let out a laugh that was soon turned into a cough yes flitwick began well next time bring them he said obviously he had missed the sarcasm in her voice and the thought made her feel even guiltier he had taken her completely seriously it not him that changed hermione hushed the quiet voice in the back of her mind despite the fact she knew it told the truth and tried to focus on the now sullen professor lecturing we will be having a group quiz he explained each of you will be given a sheet of paper with a list of all the spells you are required to know at this point in time you will divide them fifteen to each person in you group and you will practice flitwick took a deep breath then continued then i will call each of you up in a random order and you will perform a random spell of my choosing i will be grading on technique power of voice and how the spell works so do exactly as i have taught you and you should do fine he paused again to gauge the reaction we will be doing this every last class of the weeks before owl s there were groans around the room and hermione was surprised to find herself groaning along with the majority of the class flitwick passed out the papers and paused at the gryffindor group apprehensively will you be able to work with these two productively asked flitwick and hermione scowled haventi always she asked darkly and flitwick frowned yes always he said while handing them the sheets he quickly moved to his desk and sat atop his pile of books staring gloomily at the students around him occasionally he would offer a comment or two but other than that he kept unusually broodingly silent what the hell is your problem harry asked as he gave hermione a glare that she was sure she would never forget i i hermione trailed off and shrugged i tired of caring she answered and ron laughed let work harry said and hermione nodded whatever it is we can talk later you and i he said and ron nodded all right hermione gets the levitating one and oh the translation one as well and that one right there and what about the ron voice trailed off as he received a look of shock from hermione and harry what he asked those are all the really hard ones harry replied curtly yeah well she never minded before ron objected well she does this time we re all going to pull our own weight what re you going to do if you get a hard one asked harry and ron shrugged exactly you get the levitating one and i ll have yes the shadow one hermione looked at harry a look of admiration mingled with thankfulness on her face and began taking charms that she preferred standing after ten minutes of negotiating for spells they readied themselves for the practicing all right we should go counterclockwise with turns harry suggested and hermione nodded that meant ron went first all right first on my list wingardium leviosa he shifted into a ready stance and lifted his wand what shall i make fly he asked and hermione looked around how about flitwick hat i up for a good laugh she offered and ron nodded it was an accident i was aiming for one of the books on his desk that the story all right hermione and harry both nodded waiting for the thing to happen wingardium leviosa ron exclaimed and they watched humorously as flitwick hat slowly rose off and hovered four feet above the wizard head what on earth my hat he shouted as he attempted to jump for it my hat help he shouted but no one could move for the laughter was contagious flitwick jumped and he jumped but to no avail and as planned ron had accidentally missed with the spell and it had hit the teacher hat by pure incident your turn hermione ron said with a smile still present on his elven face he motioned her to get on with it and she complied she was ready to feel magic under her fingertips again hmmm i have the decutio one right here i ll just knock over that book set it up for me harry please hermione said and harry nodded all right hermione readied her self and as she gripped her wand tightly in her hand she felt the magic collect within her hand and felt it course into her wand ready to let loose the second she said the magic word decutio hermione said and she felt the magic loose itself towards the book which was soon knocked over onto its side good show flitwick said and hermione smiled it felt good now you harry ron said and harry glared i have the displodo spell cool i get to blow something up he exclaimed and hermione rolled her eyes what to blow up what to blow u i know he said suddenly ron step a little to the right perfect displodo ron let out a high pitched shriek and jumped out of the way of the spell hermione crossed her arms over her chest and shook her head that was dang you should have seen the look on your face harry laughed and ron tight lipped frown broke into a smile and once again hermione found herself lost in the vortex of a relationship she would never understand the relationship between male friends that she would never share in on all right ron began it my turn and i have the heightening charm amplifico alere hermione you re tall enough harry let make you eye level ron suggested and harry shrugged a bitter smile touching his lips his height was a sensitive issue now ron said do you want to be hagrid tall or fred and george tall ron asked harry who shrugged all right then you get what you get then amplifico alere ron said and harry didntmove what the suddenly a shriek sounded from a table nearby and ron cringed oops he muttered while trying to look innocent amber not going to be too pleased ron said me elongating one of her brethren and all he finished amber hermione inquired with a smirk they re quite serious these days harry interjected and ron threw him an ugly glare is that so hermione asked with a raised eyebrow good for you two she said and she was surprised to find that she meant it she had someone else besides ron on her even if she wasntready to admit it yet yeah i had to beg on my knees for what happened at the ball i was sort of a jerk he said slowly and hermione nodded yeah you were get on with it hermione harry said quick before flitwick realizes you re a socialite in disguise oh fuck you harry hermione said and immediately a hand flew to her mouth but instead of looks of shock hermione saw a grin spread across harry face and both the bows burst into laughter i knew it ron i have next spell and i choose you as my guinea pig let see it the levo spell i going to make you stupid ron smile faded and hermione lifted her wand draco walked into the potions classroom and took his seat second row third seat back he had been dreading this moment since lunch when his mind had been freed of educational distraction it was during that time that he realized he had an almost three hour period with hermione granger and he couldntsay a word with a sigh draco took a look around the room noting all the slytherins present he had decided the night before that he would reintegrate himself into the slytherins for it was better to be safe and hated than in danger and loved for what protection did love offer other than fanatic distractions there was a loud bang as heather holley slammed her books onto the table and sat in the seat next to him hello draco how is one like yourself doing on a fine day like this she asked speaking in the riddle he had become accustomed to hearing in her voice i was just about to say hello to crabbe over there draco said with a calculated sneer and heather laughed running amongst the wolves again eh she asked little do they know you re a sheep she said in a whispered tone so only he could hear a black one but a sheep all the same eh i no sheep draco spat i am just as horrible as any in the lot of them he said right and i harry potter sister heather said why dontyou run along and join your little anime club they sit right over there with the gryffindorks draco said slowly his tone was sarcastic but the grin on his face suggested she had better do it please draco heather said sardonically as she read his expression you re about as much a threat to my person as you father himself heather snarled emphasizing he was sure the fact that his father was dead help me then draco whispered ah i knew there was something you needed else would you re mingle with the bunch of block headed cannibals over there what is it you ll be needing then she asked i have to find my way back into the inner workings of slytherin draco said and he let his voice trail off dramatically why on earth heather asked but draco shook his head all you need to know is that it is a necessity he replied coolly almost harshly and heather nodded your quickest way would be through crabbe she offered and draco nodded i guessed that much he seems to be the new slytherin king draco stated bitterly and heather smiled missing the position of power draco she asked and draco shook his head the girls then draco rolled his eyes i miss the option he said quietly can you help me or not you re going to have to do a lot of gryffindor bullying something you seem to excel at and there ll be a lot of proving to do along the way heather said informing him of all the facts but this he already knew how long will it take he asked and heather thought for a moment we wontbe starting until we have a game plan but once everything starts coming together it shouldnttake more than two weeks heather replied but there something you have to know draco this isnta game once you re there you cantback out again she said stating something that had crossed his mind more than once these past few hours he had dwelled on it shouldnti do something today draco asked feeling as if he was being idle for an image of hermione had just flashed in front of closed lids yes you might want to try talking to the beast today test the waters a bit yes you should do that she said tell him something he wants to hear and if they bring up what happened between you and hermione think of something good or it ll be your head above crabbe door and not hers though draco didntlike the reference of hermione head above anyone door he agreed standing draco straightened his cloak and strode in dignity to crabbe table of miscreants well if it isntthe great betrayer said the voice of one of crabbe close companions that draco recognized as alec norrington a seventh year who was repeating potions with the sixth years twice come to beg hissed a female voice that voice he didntrecognize until he matched the face it was millicent but boy had she cleaned up nicely it was obvious that someone had done a charm on her blockish figure and turned her into a voluptuously curved young woman it certainly wasntnatural how attractive she had gotten this past year no i merely wished to clear up a few things that you dontseem to understand draco held up his hand as someone opened their mouth to add a snide comment and barked in the voice of command his father had given him i am speaking he said and crabbe smiled letting a chuckle free from his massive chest right go on i thought it imperative that you know i harbor no ill will to slytherins as you should not vincent draco said in his smooth voice that he used when buttering up a diplomat of importance i wish i hadntbeen forced to it draco the dark lord has made it clear to me that those who would not stay loyal in times of peace cannot be trusted in war crabbe said it is a simple concept that you especially you should know he said who said i was ever disloyal draco asked in his slippery voice and the sound caused his stomach to churn we saw what you did saving the gryffindor girl like that forcing pansy to flee into hiding what else could your actions display to us crabbe asked and suddenly draco was struck by how much they had all underestimated this slytherin intelligence what a mistake that was a death on the hands of the slytherins draco said well if the war between all the houses hadntbegan that surely would have sparked something you take me as a fool i know what lies in the best interest of my house and the death of the gryffindor would not have done at all draco crossed his arms over his chest and the he felt the familiar curling of his lip as he sneered the sneer that was his he felt the familiarity in this and suppressed a shudder what happened to what you conveyed to our late mutual friend he told me of a very distressing conversation you two had and to not consider that would make me a fool crabbe said he was smart goyle had been a decoy draco realized a decoy used to distract away from crabbe intelligence had goyle known that was why crabbe was still alive and goyle dead goyle hadntbeen faking his stupidity indeed i was going through a rough phase at that time my father had just died and i was left without my mentor a loss of great proportions you should know draco replied smartly and crabbe nodded draco could tell he was still reading him from the cold calculating look in the slytherin eyes i thought we had lost you there you will be a most valuable friend crabbe said a smile flashing its way across his mouth welcome to testing phase his look said to draco and he swallowed deep in his throat suddenly the bell rang and draco gave a short nod of his head and left the small congregation of slytherins to their whispers and suspicions sitting down next to heather he let out a sigh of relief and she smiled they bought it she asked and draco nodded you must be good she commented dryly he a lot smarter than he let on draco said and heather let out a small laugh it was there for those who would see it you know heather said it like the legend of the sorcerer stone in the famed mirror of erised those who would use it could not see it whatever you re going on about draco voice trailed off as three very happy gryffindors entered the classroom obviously he wasntthe only one who had rekindled old alliances among his house potter and weasley seemed quite pleased with themselves though weasel had an oddly dumb look on his face sit down already said a sharp voice from snape inner office and all the talk stopped snape emerged as unhappy and sour as ever and walked to the front of the classroom waiting for affect it was a method of intimidation sixth years owl are approaching and considering that this week is owl awareness week for hogwarts i will do no less than test and test and test you there were groans around the classroom and snape smirked they were miserable and he fed off their misery first he began and some people jump at the sharp abruptness with which he had spoken we will learn about a very dangerous potion used only for the darkest of purposes he said and everyone was suddenly hanging on his every word draco admired his teacher then as he always had for his innate ability to attract electric attention to himself the man was quite capable when it came to stealing their attention and turning it into blubbering adoration whether negative or positive it is called the concocion de amore he said his voice taking on the lilting latin accent most professionally i thought you said that we wouldntbe studying love potions for another two terms it says in our course guidelines that we received over christmas break that love potions were not to be explored until late into seventh year suddenly draco head went to mush thoughts of the face behind that voice were enough to cripple him he realized suddenly and he didntlike it if we went strictly by the guidelines you would remain ignorant forever miss granger he hissed quietly by dangerously oh and next time you call out of turn it will cost you dearly snape threatened and draco grinned snape words were enough to wake him from his substantially weakened state it was imminent that he stray from the path of mixing emotion and education things like that never worked properly perhaps that the point draco shook his head slowly and pulled out a piece of parchment on which to take notes slowly his glance and attention slipped from his curved and tilted writing across the classroom where hermione sat paying avid attention to snape lesson he watched as hermione chewed the end of her quill and he wondered what she thought about that made her nervous turning back to his paper he mentally smacked himself forcing himself to focus singly upon his parchment hermione felt eyes upon her but was afraid to turn biting her quill she tried to focus on snape words but it was so hard to do when just feet away sat her rescuer he called me beautiful her feminine side cried out with glee at the thought but her sensible side said it was a whim that draco was temporarily exploring temporarily sighing she ventured a look across the room and catching a glimpse of silvery hair she quickly looked away slowly and discreetly looking back draco came into view and he was concentrating so hard on his parchment that she wondered if he even had anything else on that mind of his hermione smiled as she saw him subconsciously pick lint off of his robe sleeve she noticed that it was a habit when he was either stressed or frustrated which was it stressed or frustrated it was like he wasntclean enough already if he keeps at it he going to pick the thing apart she thought to herself looking back to the front hermione silently sighed she was so confused about everything he called me beautiful draco grudgingly let his eyes wander and as they always did they fell upon a bushy haired smart pretty gryffindor with an affinity for being right if he could only but no the thought was absurd he convinced himself to even ponder that thought was blasphemy it was a disrespect to his dead father but it was such an attractive thought his less socially controlled side said and even his logical side had to agree since when did draco malfoy have sides he asked himself very suddenly looking forwards draco noticed a very large hooked nose in front of his face amused mr malfoy snape breathed and draco leaned back airily and gave a passive smile to his favorite professor quite your classes always carry an air of excitement i find hard to deny draco replied slyly this was for his performance nothing more and snape had to realize this or else draco was in big trouble with his head of house good now i suggest you quickly find yourself a seat on the other side of the room that will cause a bit less of a distraction to your obviously incapacitated brain snape snarled and draco gathered his things with a smile on his face what is he thinking hermione asked harry suddenly and her friend shrugged how re any of us going to guess what goes on in that head of his you should really take better notes hermione harry said and she glared you think kittens are going to help you pass the test hermione looked down at her paper saw hearts and kittens crumpled it up and shoved it embarrassed into her bag where she swore it would stay for all of eternity she doubted she could even throw it away lest someone recognize her hand writing settle down you re a bit distracted that all right harry whispered and hermione took a deep breath just dontmake a habit of it i dontthink i like taking the full load that usually your job i wontmake a habit of it hermione said the slytherins were the first ones to leave the class and before hermione could catch draco he had disappeared into the folds of his old posse was there something he had neglected to tell her he doesnthave to tell you everything you know i know what hermione did you say something ron asked and hermione stared at him in mock confusion what are you talking about you re definitely hearing things ron you may want to get your hearing checked hermione said and ron fingered his ears nervously that was mean harry said in an undertone and hermione giggled but the expression on his face was worth it so when are you coming back to the dorms crabbe asked and draco shrugged i prefer the prefect dorms actually they re much roomier more fit for a malfoy he replied perfectly in character and crabbe laughed always one for finery it been quite the long time draco crabbe patted him on the back and draco fought the urge to vomit as if he had just seen a human slaughtered yes well my father taught me that those who earned the best deserved the best draco said sorry about your father it must have been quite the blow for your mother the poor girl draco resented that crabbe talked about his mother like a common lesser person but let it pass without comment she was distraught but she is working hard to piece things back together before i return home for spring break draco stated with a yawn their little entourage of slytherins turned the corner and draco spotted the group of gryffindors headed towards them he saw hermione among the group and felt his stomach drop as he saw her laugh at one of weasel lame jokes he could practically hear the slytherins around him bear their teeth and growl but draco was unable to break his eyes from hermione and missed crabbe question hermione looked up her stomach sore from laughing and her eyes caught draco as he and his group of slytherin marched forth like a phalanx of spartans ready for battle the gryffindors around her tensed as they neared and she saw harry mouth turn down into a frown hermione flexed her fingers wishing to wave and say hello but the greeting died in her throat unable to break eye contact hermione kept her eyes locked onto draco gray blue irises as if they were the only to people in the halls draco felt his hand spasm as he resisted the drive to give a sweet greeting instead he kept her eyes in his sight and walked on passing one another the gryffindors and slytherins exercised great impulse control not to start a brawl in the middle of the hallway passing there was only silence hello hey you all right it looks like you re blushing ron said and hermione shrugged those slytherins get all of us riled up seamus said with a laugh and hermione nodded harry though didntmiss the flushed look on her face and the way her hands shook either she was afraid of the slytherin or she or she no well are you going to answer me crabbe asked and draco snapped back to reality pushing the image of hermione chocolate brown eyes from his mind he asked crabbe to repeat the question what were you thinking of crabbe asked and draco shrugged gryffindors are so arrogant it makes me lose my mind is all draco replied slowly convincingly or so he thought crabbe turned a raised eyebrow expression to norrington who nodded understandable certainly understandable this is just another transition chapter it very very very short and i apologize but like i always say these five hundred and so words are just leading to the next so many thousands i know it doesntsay much and it kind of pointless but i needed a way to get to the next chapter without losing sight of what going on around the d h story line and how it affecting the other characters chapter 23 two very surprised gryffindors did i just see what i thought i saw asked ron in disbelief and harry was unable to answer considering his jaw lay on the ground did i just see what i thought i saw ron repeated in the same tone and harry shivered this isntright something about this has a bad smell harry said slowly and ron nodded in agreement yeah it malfoy that the smell ron spat in disgust but harry shook his head no it reeks of sincerity that why it so bad i would understand if he was doing it for some kind of sick slytherin thing but hermione buying it and hermione always been smarter than us he said remember lockhart ron asked and harry smiled could i forget he asked but no it not like that did hermione ever let on about this harry asked did i miss it she been at him all year haventyou noticed ron asked that what the fight at the dance was about that what most of our fights have been about all year her and that damned slytherin i dontunderstand no one can in order for something to be understood it has to make sense and nothing about this makes sense ron said that what bothers me harry uttered with a sigh of frustration come on let go and play a quick game of wizard chess do you think ginny knows about this ron asked suddenly and harry shrugged do you want to be the one to tell her ron shook his head vehemently and his ears turned red me neither so let just keep it to ourselves for now ron nodded and harry led ron away from the scene of the most disturbing display of banter they had ever seen hermione involved in where the hell did malfoy go crabbe roared and everyone in the common room shrugged or moved away i thought i saw him head towards the library said a small female voice and crabbe focused on heather holley not one of their most popular slytherins but a smart one why he asked and heather shrugged to read to work on his silly documents i dunno i cantread minds she said her accent causing her to stumble over the words uncomfortably norrington bailey follow me he demanded and two slytherins stood jacobs how much time until class starts crabbed asked and another slytherin looked down at his watch thirteen minutes you have enough time to go to the library have a look around and cut it straight to charms if you hurry jacobs said and crabbe smiled once again you have wasted two minutes of valuable time giving me specifics that arentnecessary this is becoming quite the annoyance crabbe said and the slytherin nodded not sorry for his exact time table let go for a walk shall we crabbe said to the two slytherins at their side and they left the common room and headed towards the library shit heather thought they re going to know i lied and then i ll be the one in trouble shit damn draco hey all it been a long two weeks for me and i have finally gotten back into touch with my characters sorry and thanx for being in it for the long haul well without further ado here is my twenty fourth chapter i thought i d give you something to look forward to so the next chapter is so much better and i think you ll like it more so wait for it chapter 24 the six ways to get to miss granger draco sat in arithmancy class utterly bored hermione and he had passed this point months ago it was now mid march and everyone in hogwarts was feeling a bit apprehensive about the approaching tests this was more important than the owl they had taken in the previous year these exams would decide not only their classes for the next year but also their careers beyond hogwarts as draco pondered this he felt the same tension in his stomach as he always did what was he going to do outside of hogwarts the only thing he had known was forfeit and all he had now was hermione and hermione was not a career not one that could be openly pursued anyway a smile formed at the corners of his mouth as the thought came to mind and he immediately felt guilty and hurt he was sure that hermione feelings for him had passed and now that he was unafraid of the consequences that would ensue it was chance cruel humor that led her elsewhere it certainly wasntthe weasel for his focus was now upon a very attractive smart and perceptive ravenclaw known as amber solitaire though gossip held no pleasure for him draco could not help but be heard that the two were so in love for just a second after the controversial discovery he had wondered why that couldntbe him and hermione wouldntit be odd to be labeled as a miracle draco are you taking notes or daydreaming hermione voice intruded into his thoughts as she elbowed him in the arm would it be bad to say a bit of both he asked with a smirk that hermione returned with a scowl the scowl he had become so used to after the winter months had passed it was near test time and hermione examination senses were on fire and insatiable in their constant intrusion upon their already odd and somewhat unstable relationship you really should pay attention hermione said with a know it all look on her face i know draco muttered sitting up straight we ve learned this months ago though he complained and hermione smiled while shaking her head that is precisely the thing harry would say she said and her words got their desired affect well then where re we at he asked his attention avidly renewed chapter seven page three twenty three section four paragraph two hermione murmured and draco looked at her in astonishment what i ve been paying attention and you if you would have been you would have known that she said i think you should see a doctor hermione draco said seriously i think you have the antithesis of test anxiety i think you have test anticipation yeah that sounds about right hermione smacked his arm lightly with a glare and turned her attention back to the front where it was better spent yes better spent later on during the class professor cameron approached them why arentyou two in the library she asked and draco was the first to speak my companion miss granger thought that our time would be better spent listening to you go on about things we learned practiced and perfected before christmas he said caustically and hermione guffawed what better way to learn a branch of magic than to attend the class itself hermione recited from one of those stupid learning books she had been sent from home jus days before rubbish cameron said and draco smiled his own arrogant smile that he was sure she could recognize have you discovered anything new yet cameron asked inquiring about the documents suddenly and draco sat up tensing they had decided on what to say when asked that question but this was so sudden and unanticipated we have almost reached the end hermione recited slowly but this only made cameron stare at each of them more intently what hermione asked well she asked well what draco shrugged by this time you should at least have a grasp on what the spell would have accomplished cameron stated knowingly i well really it seems like a bit of silliness draco interrupted he could tell by the look on hermione face that she was about ready to spill but they had gotten too far to turn back she had to realize how much trouble they could get into for keeping this secret for as long as they had how do you suppose there a garden string here a hair string there it just random patterns mixed into one incoherent spell draco replied lying without blinking let hope there is a new document then cameron said slowly as she began walking away recent discoveries in london say that a lot of important work went on here mr malfoy it there for those who wish to find it her eyes glittered with curiosity but draco was too tired of lying to try and convince her they spoke the truth though they didn t i want to tell her hermione said once the teacher was out of earshot and draco turned towards her staring hard at her he had to give the impression that he could see through her so that she understood completely what he said we are so close hermione he began if this information was given out to every wizard out there voldemort i assure you would benefit he finished as a new argument popped into his head i am positive this information would not be denied to our beloved potions master and i know for a fact that he is still in communication with death eaters he spoke as if the matter were sealed hermione looked down guiltily and he could tell there was something she wasnttelling him what is it he asked and hermione shook her head suddenly i understand i wonttell her draco nodded surely he had won hermione rummaged through her bag and felt a spike of curiosity as her fingertips brushed a folded piece of parchment pulling it out she saw that the writing on the front said the six ways to get to miss granger a list of useful ideas of how to irritate our gryffindor prefect draco she muttered and she could only wonder how many people had a copy of this clever little list unfolding it slowly she read its contents to herself aloud one she hates it when you lie this will cost you one point two she hates it when others are wronged it the gryffindor in her and it will cost you two points third she dislikes those who have the potential to be cruel without reason she will find you and you will lose three points fourth she hates to be wronged to wrong her would be to lose four points fifth she hates disloyalty also the gryffindor in her being disloyal will lose you five points sixth and lastly hermione granger absolutely positively hates being wrong at this point you have lost so many points that you might as well not bother proving her wrong but if you dare go on ahead you have a braver soul than i hermione voice trailed off as tears choked her what awful things to say she whispered but even as she said this she felt her insides melting as they always did when draco did things like this for weeks they would be on common known ground and then draco would do something totally unexpected and she would once again doubt that what they has was nothing more than a friendship but then again maybe she was taking everything he did for her the exact opposite way that he meant for it to be displayed maybe his little gestures of comical kindness were his way of saying they were friends suddenly a rhythmic knocking on her door caught her attention and hermione turned you ready to go yet asked a very male voice from the prefect commons and hermione smiled hold on just a minute more stuffing the folded parchment into her robe pocket hermione walked to the door and flung it open coming face to face with ron harry waiting out on the steps he said he says hagrid real excited it been a while since he seen us all we just saw him the day before yesterday for comc hermione replied how amber she asked and ron blushed a deep crimson she all right why do you ask he inquired i like to know how things are going with my friends ron it not like i was targeting you for an interrogation you know it used to be polite to inquire about your friend and those important to them hermione said defensively with a joking lilt to her voice right i know for a fact that every question you ask has its own importance to you and you cantdeny it ron said suspiciously and hermione decided to continue this banter right so now you claim to be clairvoyant or is it that you believe your powers of perception have evolved over night she asked and finally he broke into a smile and hugged her to his side you re so cynical he said and hermione pushed him away playfully with a short laugh as they reached the doors to the great hall hermione paused which steps hermione asked i dunno i assumed he meant the ones outside ron said and hermione nodded opening the door just a crack hermione stepped out into the warm air as the fresh sunshine hit her hermione stomach seized in guilt she should be studying right now not romping about the grounds with her friends and the groundskeeper and his dog where is he she asked and ron shrugged said he d be here maybe he had something else he had to do before he met us here and that was why he sent me up to get you ron offered and hermione nodded accepting this as a possibility you re probably right but if he doesntshow up within the next hermione paused to look at her watch ten minutes i going to have to go study you should study as well you know she began and ron groaned cursing harry under his breath many times throughout the next ten minutes as hermione lectured him on schoolwork and how the newt would decide what careers they would have and on and on draco sat quietly in the slytherin common room with his hands folded across his lap timidly and his mouth was turned down in an unreadable frown that gave the impression he would rather be elsewhere but crabbe didntcare what other plans malfoy had there were questions crabbe needed answered and after planning this potion out for almost seven weeks he would get something out of the slytherin he needed to know what was going on behind those cold gray eyes the dark lord had told crabbe not to trust draco too easily for the memory of a weak and frivolous childhood bond that all the malfoys were very adept at the subtle game of deception and they were among the best in nerve and reaction control if they were angry you wouldntknow it until days later they were standing over your fallen body wand pointed at your face that is why the dark lord told crabbe that he had to strip away all inhibitions to lie and he saw only two possibilities in this veritaserum potion or a mind reading potion known as cordislector crabbe had chosen the former it was much easier to obtain and took a lot less conniving through everything he learned about it crabbe viewed the draco thing as merely an equation and all equations had an answer yes even the complicated all important prince of darkness could be read and unraveled like a piece of loose thread it just took the right ingredients and lucky for vincent they were all native to england a few letters to his father and he was practically swimming in the main components of the potion five of which were not allowed on the hogwarts grounds let alone inside the castle would you like a drink i quite thirsty crabbe stated to draco and draco knew better than to refuse so he nodded his stomach sinking like a rock crabbe had him trapped and by the smug look of triumph on his face the fucking git knew it norrington go to the kitchens and obtain some tea draco and i will be having a very serious conversation so i would be very pleased if you insisted upon knocking before you reenter the chambers crabbe creature nodded and left the room draco noticed a small flick of crabbe hands and a look of recognition passed over the other boy face it was quite obvious to draco that norrington was ordered to add a little bit of an extra ingredient to his minutes of silence passed and crabbe cleared his throat fidgeting if you ll excuse me i have to use the restroom he said while rising and he turned and left walking to the bathroom that draco know lie down the corridor to the left looking around in silent nostalgia memories floated in and out of his head and he sighed this wasntthe same place it housed none of the niceties that he had become so accustomed to in the prefect dorms but besides that there was one thing this place was lacking and its absence left draco slightly uneasy hermione that what this place was lacking hermione he realized then had become an even larger part of his life than he could have imagined suddenly there was a loud rapping at the door and draco watched as norrington entered carrying a tray with two teacups atop it watching him approach draco could have laughed aloud how pathetic he thought but as suddenly as the insult had entered his head did he retract it i used to be like that just as my father was before me a chain of weakness but something had changed he reminded himself norrington set the tray down with a small clink and draco noticed how he rotated the tray a whole three hundred eighty degrees before leaving it be on the tabletop you re dismissed draco said shortly as he stared upon the youth before him he was obviously younger but just by looking at him draco could see that this norrington was taller darker and more devious than even he had been at that age i donttake orders from you norrington said and draco gave him a look of such scathing reproach that the young man took a step back and retreated tell crabbe i ll be outside if he needs anything the mere boy said his tone full of loathing and draco nodded once norrington was stationed outside of the room draco took this opportunity to turn the tray back to the position in which it had been originally set on the table just as he pulled away and placed his hands politely on his lap crabbe emerged from the corridor a smile on his face where norrington he asked upon reaching the table and having a suspicious look around a common practice for all slytherins draco gave a short shrug outside he said he needed some air draco replied and crabbe nodded while taking his seat well i would propose a toast to the survival of our lines but how seemingly inappropriate that would seem considering the death of your father just months ago crabbe said pointedly and draco clenched his fist in his lap indeed well then i propose a toast to our survival of another term draco suggested and crabbe raised his eyebrows first i would ask how you think you have survived crabbe asked and draco smiled lifting his cup in front of him i here and i alive as ever ready to serve those who would serve me in return draco said and he took a quick swig of the tea immediately he felt a resonating warmth fill his throat replaced by the thick burning of mint along with another unnamed ingredient as it slid in seemingly slow motion down his throat draco tried to cough up the substance but it refused to evade its set path through his esophagus and he felt helpless to control his reaction to the tea opening his eyes he looked at crabbe who was waiting expectantly for something to happen draco sputtered hoarsely and managed a smile as he shook his head from side to side strong tea he uttered and crabbe nodded the best for the best crabbe awaited some difference in himself but found nothing had changed in the least looking upon draco he found himself waiting impatiently for some thought of his to hurl itself at him empty utterly empty what empty draco asked and crabbe was startled had he said it out loud nothing your head damn it it didntwork what didntwork draco asked genuinely puzzled crabbe you re confusing me and i think you re confusing yourself as well he took it crabbe murmured to himself and it suddenly hit draco you put something in that drink draco stated dryly and crabbe looked horrified he would fail his lord and draco would know of this failure and he would learn from it what is it i think you know norrington that fucking bastard i ll have his neck for this crabbe grimaced angrily it wasnthis fault at all you see draco said suddenly confident he had gained the upper hand in this encounter he set the drinks down and i switched them draco put it simply and crabbe hit the table as hard as he could why the fuck would you do that crabbe asked and draco smiled ironically this was quite the predicament old crabbe had gotten them both into whether it was crabbe ignorance or draco own innate distrust of slytherins in general that had led to the current situation it was something that they both faced to put it simply i donttrust you draco spat that and your little minion was a bit too careless with his discretion i personally find it hard to ignore such blatant untrustworthiness expression full of mockery draco took another drink from the cup and this gesture was obviously too much for crabbe norrington crabbe shouted so loud that draco could hear the tearing stress in his vocal chords the doors to the common room opened abruptly and norrington entered walking swiftly and efficiently towards the table yes crabbe norrington inquired obviously distraught at the thought of the way he had been summoned do not give him reason to suspect anything odd is going on were these not my exact words crabbe snarled at norrington as if he were a speck on the bottom of his shoe that was tarnishing its appearance y yes that was your instruction to me norrington stuttered and draco turned to crabbe dontblame him for your incompetence when it comes to choosing reliable servants draco said slimily and crabbe nodded get out of my sight crabbe snapped in a biting tone to norrington and the boy knew better than to disobey get out once norrington had left the room draco read crabbe thoughts as easily as if he were saying them aloud to answer that i would have to first go into detail about why i have tried to stay distant from your crew draco replied to the unasked question and crabbe growled under his breath i fear you underestimate me my old friend draco said in a cutting tone that made crabbe ball his hands into fists that on other occasion might have already found themselves an easy target i ve learned not to do that that is the whole reason i did this he said gesturing to the table i spent almost eight weeks making the potion and the better part of that figuring out how i would do it down to the very last meticulous bit of detail i could include crabbe replied i even planned where i would take our dialogue i guessing those plans didntinclude me taking the potion draco said a hint of sarcasm in his voice and crabbe shrugged i should go i have some studying to do newt are right around the corner you know draco stood where do your loyalties lie draco crabbe asked outright and draco shrugged turning away when has anyone ever known the answer to that question draco asked not even my father knew the answer to that question and we all know how much control he had over my life notice that i stress the word had crabbe draco spat i had enough of my father controlling and dictating every move i made when he was alive and it d be plain stupid of me to hand it over to someone new when i have had so little time to test my new freedoms tell that to voldemort you know i can t crabbe said and draco laughed tell him what you want then tell him i ve once again joined your ranks draco said in feigned reverence and crabbe didntmiss the implied sarcasm in his words you ll be very sorry when you realize what an opportunity you have missed because of your hasty decision crabbe said as draco approached the exit i haventmissed an opportunity crabbe you have and in saying that i would like to bring another point to the table i never said anything about making a decision i merely wish to postpone my passing judgment on any set course right away he said slyly his hand on the doorknob i guess we ll all be left to wait for you then crabbe said the dark lord interest in you is not a passing thing draco that you need to understand he will destroy anything and everything that stands between you and him and he will not wait to make his move against you decisions need to be made swiftly and permanently crabbe said and draco scoffed that little snake is feeding me advice through that forked tongue but even as this thought passed through his mind draco could sense the truth in crabbe coldly calculated words they were meant to sting meant to scare but most of all they were meant to scare draco draco walked through the door and felt a wave of foreboding pass through him in the form of a shiver passing through his spine like a spiny shock draco stepped through the arched door making a promise to never return to this place and if he did let everything he held dear be dead that could easily be arranged said the voice in the back of draco awareness and for the first time in weeks draco could see clearly the face of lord voldemort staring back at him the words in his mind had come from the dark lord and the thought brought the unpleasant images from his dream back snape is so cute draco nearly jumped as the thought hit his mind and suddenly he was under attack from all sides voice after voice was filling his mind until he could only recognize bits and pieces of intelligible thoughts where is he i cannot believe she wore that today that stupid bitch mcgonagall is going to pay for that detention fuck i didntdo my charms i d like to see what under that skirt looking around draco realized what the cause of this barrage was he was in the great hall and it was almost dinner time there were hundreds of students in the hall and all their thoughts were being channeled to him draco looks good today thought a passing girl and draco grinned maybe this wasntso bad after all that was until a hufflepuff boy walking past was thinking the exact same thing thoroughly disturbed draco made his way as quickly as he could from the great hall up towards the library where there were no people and where he would try to do some studying try of course was the operative word hermione looked at herself in her body mirror and sighed pulling back her frizzy hair into an attempted pony tail she groaned loudly why am i even bothering grabbing a brush from her side table she attempted to run it through her tangled tresses but only ended up feeling worse than she had before she had tried to clean up her appearance walking to her bed she paused where are you crookshanks she asked the little picture she often left on her bed to remind her of her lost cat it had been so long that hermione had given up on crookshanks coming back either he was happy elsewhere with new owners or he was hermione shook her head from side to side trying to dismiss the thought and threw her book bag over her shoulder throwing one more glance at her mirror she straightened her skirt and blouse growled menacingly at the mirror and pointedly tossed a cloak over it as hermione walked through the corridors towards the library she wondered at herself and her sudden self consciousness she figured it was the female inside her begging to be released but hermione refused to even consider letting that happen making her way through the maze of tables she had once known so well hermione walked straight to the back her eyes downcast eros she uttered and the blue shield around the room dissipated and she was admitted throwing up the force field behind her hermione slammed the door leaning her back against the door and let out an anguished sigh walking over to the documents she grabbed her folder and looked through her work as she shuffled through the papers she realized how close they were to being able to test the actual spell the though both attracted and repelled her on one hand they would make the greatest discovery in magic history and on the other if the counter spell didntwork one of them would die the prospect of the former one was what weighed most heavily on her mind though she knew draco felt the opposite taking her place at the table hermione set all of her stuff down on the tabletop and leaned forward inspecting the previous document she had been working on not after five minutes of silent concentration did hermione hear the door open and once again self consciousness made her tense i wonder if he ll notice i having a bad day she thought to herself and draco smiled at her as he walked behind her and grabbed his folder how was your day hermione he asked as he took the seat across from her and laid out his documents in his meticulous system that only he knew perfect terrible what happened draco asked his eyes full of concern and hermione was taken aback what do you mean hermione asked and draco shrugged displaying just a hint of discomfort something must have happened to make your day so perfect he replied as he began marking documents off and replacing them into the folder hermione wondered then what marks he put on his papers and what they were for i like to know when a certain string ends so that i can keep track of exactly the one i on that clever she commented he wonteven look at me i must look dreadful hermione bit her lip and sat down tears burning behind her eyes i saw you walking over to hagrid hut today you look really pretty with your hair pulled back you know hermione eyes shot up to meet his and he gave her a smile that said more to her than his words had how was your meeting with crabbe hermione asked suddenly wanting to hear about someone else horrible day why do i care so much about what he thinks it didntgo too bad draco began but seriously tell me about your day he said as he made a few new marks alongside the old ones i realized i fat ugly and my cat is dead nothing out of the ordinary to tell really i just glad school got over when it did i dontthink i could stand another minute with mcgonagall looking over my shoulder for the first opportunity to use me as her prime example hermione said with a smile as she brushed a strand of unruly brown hair out of her face it a compliment to be noticed he said and hermione felt the oddest sense that he knew what she was thinking the way his mind was working was unnatural he seemed too sensitive too receptive for you you like the attention for once i just want to sit in a class and space out without worrying whether my friends will need my notes to study before the end of term exam because they were too busy having a good time to take accurate notes of their own she ranted and draco frowned without looking up let them take their exams without your notes he said coldly and hermione ceased all movement what she asked let them learn to take their own notes draco repeated and hermione shook her head no i i didntsay anything she said fearfully a twinge of curiosity in her voice and draco looked suddenly shocked the look on your face i thought all right spill hermione said shortly and draco smiled a smile that made her stomach churn my little slytherin buddy was planning a very clever trick on me you see draco began it would have worked had i not suspected something and i took a drink of what was specially made for crabbe he had planned to drink cordislector so he could read my mind and i so you can read my mind hermione asked suddenly and draco tried to read behind the expression on her face but all he could see was blatant anger it s fading i so you knew everything i was thinking and i you made a fool of me using my unasked questions for your amusement hermione said her face suddenly flushed red and an embarrassed look came over her face that not why save it she said turning silent as she looked down at her notes again and currently she didntcare what his stupid system was are you angry with me draco asked and hermione looked at him her eyes tearing at him with their unspoken rage you re the one that reads minds she snarled suddenly she gathered her papers together slammed her folder shut and replaced it on the shelf angrily grabbing her bag she walked to the door draco reached out suddenly desperate and grabbed her arm and for what he was sure wouldntbe the last time he felt her slip from his grasp stupid stupid stupid draco cursed himself as he repeatedly struck his forehead suddenly standing he let the rage he had let sit dormant inside of him for the past three months boil over and he hit the table moving it more then a foot forward with one large sweep of his arm he sent parchment and ink flying every which way ruining his perfect order something that would set them both back weeks there no fucking winning he shouted to himself and the voice in the back of his mind decided to share its piece that how it is with love it said and draco punched growled hitting the stone wall next to him so hard that he felt his knuckles crunch under the major blow groaning draco cradled his hand against him as he threw his weight against the wall panting it not love when you re never happy he murmured as he sank to the floor leaning his head against his knees the confused slytherin allowed the blood from his injured hand to leak down over his perfectly pressed clothing what did it matter he asked himself she ll just make me bleed again he whispered fuck it fuck it fuck it this chapter had a real nice flow and i think it turned out well and had theaffect i wanted it to this is my second update in like six hours but i cheated i finished 24 like a week ago but i wanted to make it allbetter so i waited until i had most of this chappie done so here you go enjoy hopefully and i would like to give a great shout out to all the people who have reveiwed you do wonders for me and my ego as well as give meareas of my style that need to be improved new sorry for not clarifying it but the original chaser has disappeared and they need a new one somewhere between editing and posting that little peice was lost i am very sorry chapter 25 dontbe silly mudbloods dontfly hermione looked at the crumpled piece of parchment and despite an hour of reflection she was still angered by the slightly tilted handwriting that flowed so neatly across the page why does he make me so angry hermione asked and her kelltor walked over from the corner jumped onto her bed and attempted to snuggle as close to hermione as he could get i mean logically it doesntmake any sense one minute we are fine with one another and the next he does something stupid and i cantstand the thought of him she practically shouted at auru i know it not your fault auru hermione cooed petting the kelltor head softly as she inspected the animal coat but if you had any ideas you d share right hermione asked the creature who cocked his head in confusion and licked her hand almost carelessly but hermione knew better this kelltor had an agenda you re hungry too she asked auru who barked loudly in response i hungry too anger devours one energy hermione patted auru head once more before standing and auru gave a whine what is it hermione asked and auru made his wishes made clear by wagging his tail no you cantcome with people dontlike the idea of kelltors running around the castle as it is i not going to risk dumbledore having to take action against you auru walked to the corner edge of the bed turned his back on hermione and sat dwelling you ll be happy to see me when i back with a plate full of hogwarts fattiest bacon mark my words hermione smiled at the creature which only rose its nose in petty bitterness i ll be back hermione promised and she turned to walk out of the room running her hand along the smooth walls hermione made her way leisurely through the corridors looking up every once in a while she took the time to notice portraits of former workers at hogwarts and others of people she didntrecognize as she did this she couldnthelp but wonder if some of these held a secret passage or a portrait hole that one could climb through she knew for a fact that harry possessed a map that displayed every secret hogwarts had including some filch himself did not know about the marauder map he had called it and it had been made by harry own father though it was in some ways helpful hermione had to wonder if harry was using it for good or evil she had noticed over the past few months that harry seemed to know more about the school than any of them could possibly know there had also been strange mutterings from ron about harry getting up at two in the morning to use the bathroom and he didntcome back sometimes a whole hour later considering this thought hermione wondered where he went at night certainly not to ginny he would never disrespect the weasley by dishonoring their daughter in such a way the weasleys were like family to harry the only one he had ever known and ron never would he hurt ron like that hermione knew but this train of thought gave no answers that hermione was looking for turning the corner hermione came suddenly face to face with heather holley hermione heather exclaimed i just saw draco what on earth happened his hand all messed up and he refuses to speak a word of anything to me we had an argument that all hermione said vaguely while she shifted her weight from her right leg to her left not that it any of your business she added clearly uncomfortable with the slytherin eyes gazing through her it bloody well is my business heather snarled matching hermione tone which displayed a certain distrust for her it must have been one hell of an argument heather observed smugly as if she had the right to talk about it it looks as though draco shattered his knuckles into a thousand pieces hermione eyes opened wide and she felt a pang in the pit of her stomach but on the outside she rolled her eyes nonchalantly and placed her hands on her hips what draco does in his spare time is his deal i cantdo anything about it hermione said allowing some of her frustration to flow into her voice how wrong that statement sounds coming from you hermione heather said with a smirk as she crossed her arms over her chest and leaned lightly against the wall her slender frame fitting into the small corner i could imagine something like that coming from weasley even potter but not from you considering heather finished and hermione could not miss the laughter in the girl voice considering what hermione asked suddenly angry again that we work together for over forty something hours a week that we have developed a common ground and have become friends hermione spat her tense stance suggested hostility that her voice could not help but convey friends is that what you are heather asked the laughter still in her voice yes friends hermione said defensively wondering whether or not this slytherin knew as much as she let on draco has made perfectly clear how he feels about me and i have the uttermost respect for that oh has he heather asked because according to draco he canttell you how he feels she said cutting to the chase and hermione was taken aback by the truth she heard in heather voice it great to know he feels comfortable talking to you about things that involve me hermione snarled after all why should i know what the hell going on i only bloody involved first off he would talk to you about it if you d actually listen when he tried to broach the subject and second off what the hell the matter with you hermione cringed as heather pushed herself roughly out of the corner and leaned forward accentuating every word it not just you here hermione and if that is what you think then i know draco would do better off elsewhere excuse me this whole draco having feelings thing is a little new for me hermione said we were enemies now we re friends and friends is all we will ever be she finished knowing this to be the truth did you bother telling draco that heather asked that a ridiculous question that doesnteven deserve an answer and you should know that hermione said and heather shrugged then we re done here but before i leave you to wallow in your self importance i would like you to know one simple fact heather said holding up her index finger to exaggerate her point every single person in draco life has given up on him she began brandishing her finger at hermione he was born and grew up alone he still alone and if what you just said is true then he is destined to die alone and if you were draco how would that thought make you feel with that said heather pushed roughly past hermione leaving all of her doubts exposed with a frown hermione leaned against the wall sighing deeply she felt tears stinging behind her eyes but she refused to let them fall how was it any of heather bloody business hermione asked herself walking towards the great hall hermione refused to answer that question let alone allow her mind to dwell on it it was a stupid question of course draco knew how things were he knew better than she did all the reasons why they wouldntwork not together anyway that had never even been a possibility walking into the great hall hermione eyes wandered looking for three specific gryffindors upon seeing them she marched forth like a soldier entering the heat of battle in a sense this was quite the fitting analogy hey you guys hermione said as she sat taking her old seat next to ginny i surprised to see you newt are in little less than two months and you re actually wandering about without a book in your hand or quill behind your ear ron asked people are going to talk you know harry added and hermione laughed trying to shove the thoughts of gryffindors and slytherins to the back of her mind hey hermione there re quidditch try outs next week ginny began interrupting the banter you want to come with to watch the try outs the team could use your support and maybe you could give it a try hermione instinct was to say no but upon asking herself why she shouldn t her mind changed i not much on a broom so i ll just come and watch if i support those two it would be terrible if i didntdo the entire team the same courtesy wouldntit ginny smiled while harry and ron frowned playfully harry lips fell into a pout and ginny cooed gently fondly rubbing his shoulders ruffling harry hair ginny leaned forward planting an obviously affectionate kiss on harry cheek and suddenly hermione wondered if she had been wrong before about harry and ginny dontworry about it ginny whispered she just jealous of your talent she finished and ron spewed dinner all over everyone food ginny have some dignity woman you re not a harlot he coughed and harry i d appreciate if you and my sister didntgo at it while i trying to eat my meal he said while wiping his mouth in disgust pushing his plate forward he refused to eat another bite harry ginny and hermione were laughing hysterically at the look on ron face when suddenly there was a loud bang from the front of the hall the laughter died very suddenly as they watched draco malfoy enter the great hall hand sloppily bandaged and he took a seat at the slytherin table looking around hermione had a flashback from the beginning of the year the same tension between their houses had arisen again and everything seemed to be back to the way it had been at the beginning of the year gryffindors with gryffindors and slytherins with slytherins there was a not so subtle difference though hermione admitted draco was not the same to her now as he had been then now he was a real person someone who had fears weaknesses and most of all he had a very human quality that before she had taken as arrogance and undeserved pride i think i going to start sleeping in the gryffindor dormitories again the prefect dormitories are too crowded hermione said quietly forcing herself to look away maybe you should talk to ginny about it harry whispered and hermione eyes met his a question in her glance he knew then and that meant ron did as well hermione nodded knowing full well that she wouldnttalk to ginny about it at all she knew better than anyone how ginny felt about slytherins let alone this one in particular minutes later hermione let out a monstrous yawn and stood she was exhausted and she was sure auru wouldntbe too pleased with her longer than normal dinner i going to head up to bed she said and gathered a plate of food for auru are you sleeping in the dorms tonight ginny asked while taking a final swig of pumpkin juice wiping her face on her sleeve hermione shook her head no i have to pack everything up and it too much of a hassle for tonight she said knowing there was another reason entirely she wanted a chance to talk to draco what heather had said had made her start to think i ll see you tomorrow then we have a lot of catching up to do you and i ginny called after hermione as she turned to leave and hermione nodded goodnight she called behind her if she comes she comes if she doesntshe doesn t nothing lost draco sat in the prefect commons waiting for what he wasntsure he knew that she was angry no they were angry at each other once again draco didntknow why draco suddenly longed for who he had been before that detention but that seemed like ages ago like it was too far out of reach for him to even think about it it felt like years ago that night everything that happens in life shapes who you are to become reminded the soft voice of narcissa malfoy shut up he said if you dontlet the bad in with the good you become complacent like your father he took no risks he played it safe with voldemort rather than do the right thing and be crushed he wanted to do the crushing you re not like your father yes i am draco shouted at himself i am like my father i a spitting fucking image of the bastard suddenly the door to the common room opened and hermione walked through it for just a second his anger was gone but then it returned stronger than ever walking towards him slowly hermione set a plate on the table and draco ground his teeth wondering at her calmness as she moved to the right to sit down the light from the fire reached him and seeing his hand she gasped jesus draco what did you she began reaching forward draco pulled his injured hand away and she did not object i talked to heather she worried about you she said quietly and draco nodded stiffly he noted how she mentioned heather name and not her own though it was obvious how she felt just leave me alone he said letting his voice take on its callous quality draco dontbe angry with me i ve had a lot on my mind but you probably know that she said making a reference to the cordislector he had taken i not angry granger he spat forcing the emotion from his voice i indifferent draco smiled his cold smile that didntquite reach his eyes and watched in fascination as a look of recognition then solace passed over hermione face he knew this was mean but at this point he could care less why she asked because granger he emphasized the use of her surname i am tired of caring he spat his voice betraying his disgust at himself i didnttell heather to say a damn word to you so wipe that filthy look off your face he snarled viciously and he watched as her face move quickly from hurt to anger i never implied that she did hermione said softly making the gut wrenching feeling of guilt worsen which made him even angrier dontplay innocent he said even though he didntquite know what he was referring to what are you talking about draco hermione asked her chocolate brown eyes showing exactly how she felt hurt angry and above all confused i i dunno i just want to be left alone all right draco said quietly and hermione made no move to leave just get the fuck out and leave me alone you ve said enough and i ve said enough now go before i say something i regret draco snapped and hermione stood tears in her eyes he watched in inner horror as a single tear fell down her face and she bit her lip trying to hold back hurt she knew she felt isntit a bit too late for that hermione whispered as she turned and left grabbing the plate she hurried through the doorway and he could not help but feel some relief at this the sunlight filled the quidditch pitch through moving clouds and hermione let out a sigh she had to admit sitting on the bench was a lot less fun than she had imagined for the past hour and a half hermione had watched in polite interest as gryffindor after gryffindor took the sky in an attempt to woo harry after harry told the fifteenth gryffindor to hit the ground ginny had gotten very frustrated it not the nationals harry lighten up she had shouted as the team touched ground for a small break what was wrong with steven she asked throwing her broom over her shoulder ron looked at his watch a grim expression on his face he had planned to meet amber twenty minutes ago yeah mate steven wasnthalf bad not half bad isnt what i looking for you two i looking for excellent he replied enthusiastically the chasers are the ones that score the points and we need those points he exclaimed hermione tell him to be reasonable ginny groaned i personally agree hermione said slowly surprised that what she said was true i glad harry wants to make the team exceptional but hey what the hell are they doing here asked the other chaser seamus and hermione eyes flitted to the other side of the field where seven figures in green quidditch robes approached i dunno but i ll get this fixed up in a hurry harry said gritting his teeth they re not pulling that professor snape shit this time we booked the field three weeks in advance harry mumbled as he walked forward to greet the gaggle of slytherins in the middle of the field well if it isntlittle potter and his team of misfits said draco as he leaned laxly on his broom hermione noticed how he favored his left hand and held his right one close to his chest malfoy as great as it is for me to see you here we have the pitch today we re holding try outs harry said slowly as if draco couldntunderstand english well this parchment says otherwise draco drawled and harry ripped the piece of parchment malfoy was now brandishing proudly like a flag meritless harry spat doesnteven have a signature he said thrusting it back into draco outstretched hand maybe so but i can have it signed by snape in ten minutes why waste the time draco asked and harry clenched his fists he had been so stressed out during try outs that hermione doubted he had the self restraint to deny himself first blood in this fight what do you want harry asked i want to practice draco said just like you but the difference is malfoy that i booked the pitch three weeks ago and you come out here today with a piece of parchment not even signed by a first year and expect me to pack up and leave harry asked a smile in his voice i was hoping we could compromise draco said lightly you get half the pitch and i get half the pitch for my team that way we all win i dontthink you wanted a compromise harry stated and from the look on draco face hermione didntdoubt it you re right maybe we wanted a little friendly competition before our match next week said heather and hermione eyes wandered to the slender irish girl her eyes reduced to slits as she watched the girl lightly flip her hair around her shoulders so she played quidditch as well hermione thought if she can do it i certainly can why not hermione asked suddenly standing and draco looked at her in disbelief i didntknow she was trying out said heather in a hushed voice is she trying out dontbe silly mudbloods dontfly draco smirked and ron lunged forward that is the last time you ll be calling anyone a filthy name malfoy ron said whipping out his wand from the fold in his robes you have no respect it all right honestly ron hermione said grabbing his cloak and pulling him beside her and he gave her a questioning glance we ll just have to show the lot of them that mudbloods can fly hermione turned to the steven who had just been denied a spot on the quidditch team can i borrow that she asked it a nimbus have you ridden a lot steven asked and hermione guffawed all right then as long as you can handle it the seventh year said handing it over hesitantly he had never even seen hermione give a second glance to a broom let alone ride one harry could have said the same except for their first flying lesson during first year but she seemed confident enough all right granger draco began as he leapt with ease on the bottom ring of his broom and it slowly rose upwards in an almost graceful motion keeping him upright show us you can fly he swung his other leg over the side and sped up into the sky and hermione gulped just dontpanic harry said and ron nodded focus on getting it in the air and from there you ve got the rest ron said what exactly does a chaser do hermione asked and harry groaned this isnta very good idea you could get hurt ginny said but hermione brushed him away when she tried to take the broom i need to learn some time right hermione asked her heart beating wildly in her chest all i have to do is calm myself and remember what madam hooch taught me she said laying the broom on the ground hermione held her hand directly over it and closed her eyes concentrating on one thought and one thought alone up she closed her fingers around the pole of the broom and grasped tightly yes she thought excitedly mounting it hermione opened her eyes and readied herself for what was about to take place as soon as she seated herself she felt anxious to get going and as if the broom read her thoughts and her mood it zoomed suddenly into the air and she let out a scream as she tried to hold on you all right hermione asked ginny who was suddenly riding beside her and hermione groaned but then the broom leveled and all the turbulence hermione could feel was small buffets of air not too bad eh she asked no hermione uttered in wonder as an odd feeling of pride unfurled in her chest she had done the impossible not at all as bad as i thought it would be wait until they release the bludgers ginny said with a smile it wontbe so great then the smile on hermione face faded and ginny shrugged at the frightened look on hermione face fact of the game hermione i not going to lie and say there are no bludgers just keep your head about you she suggested i going to go meet with the other beater and figure out a game plan to protect you seeing as it your first time and all ginny sped off and hermione suddenly felt utterly alone looking around hermione made out many shapes in the air seven slytherins and seven gryffindors things werentgoing to turn out well for her she realized everyone on the field had at least some experience what have i gotten myself into hermione asked herself under her breath a lot of trouble said a very familiar and unwelcome male voice behind her what are you doing hermione i know for a fact you ve never played a game of quidditch in your life draco said and hermione turned to face him mind your own business malfoy i wouldntbe up here unless i wanted to be hermione replied curtly making sure draco could not miss the snarl in her words i personally dontwant to scrape you off of the pitch but then again i guess i wouldntbe the one doing the scraping would i he asked with a laugh that hermione remembered all too well hey malfoy shouted seamus and hermione turned her head dontyou have a ball to look for it looks like you may be missing more than one he shouted and hermione was grateful for the interruption why dontyou go marry your cousin hermione heard shouted from below and hermione looked down to see many of the gryffindors who had tried out watching from below with rapt attention meeting draco eyes hermione saw a blush form on his face and he swerved carelessly the other way and torpedoed to the other side of the field on his broom now he was merely a blur of green robes and as hermione reminded herself as she calmed her breathing a blur of green robes she could deal with ready for this ask seamus with a smile as he patted hermione on the back and hermione gulped nodding slowly as ready as i ll ever be any pointers she asked more ready than ever to learn with a smile she realized it may be too late watch out for the bludgers they re your main threat seamus said bobbing up and down on his broom with the wind currents also the quaffle is pretty light so dontover compensate when you get it your broom damn fast so you shouldnthave to worry about outchasing them he paused looking at hermione you ve never been on a broom before he stated a smirk forming at the corner of his mouth and hermione nodded there was no use in lying any more you re much braver than i thought you were turning the other way he flew towards the ground and waited for her to follow this is your chance let go touch down hermione heart pounded as she waited on the ground her legs shaking like jelly who calls heather asked draco who shrugged potter honestly do you lot not know how to flip a coin harry asked digging a silver sickle from his pocket call it in the air he made a move to flip the coin when heather guffawed call what in the air she asked and harry stopped hermione smiled it was ridiculous how much the wizarding world needed to learn about the muggle one heads or tails harry sighed if it lands on the face side the person who called heads wins and if it lands on the tail side the person who calls tales wins harry explained right draco spat get on with it then harry flipped the coin and called out tails looks like it heads heather drawled and harry nodded his head disappointedly i guess you call it then malfoy harry said resignedly and heather whispered something in draco ear hermione felt her face grow hot as she watched the overly friendly display and despite not being the type to get jealous hermione could have sworn she felt the seeds of envy growing every moment they were on the same field mount heather shouted and they all lifted their legs and straddled their brooms heather threw a nod to draco and hermione realized suddenly that heather was goading her on purpose well she was going to get what she wanted i can show her hermione thought as she tried to calm herself grip the broom handle any harder and you re going to snap it in half whispered seamus and hermione looked down her knuckles had turned white and she loosened her grip that a girl he said with a wink and hermione felt herself un tense just another adventure go heather shouted and hermione kicked off so hard she felt herself propelled feet above where she had wanted to be i got the quaffle seamus shouted and hermione swerved to follow his voice weaving in and out of other players hermione followed his voice they ve released the bludgers be care hermione gasped as seamus broom was struck and he flipped over the front hermione dove and reached out uncertainly for the quaffle with the light red ball in her grasp everything she was doing just suddenly felt natural hermione ducked as she saw a brown ball headed straight for her face and rolled with her broom to avoid the next one looking around she saw seamus remount and kick off move the goal hermione make a goal he shouted waving his arms frantically and hermione came back to life right she said to herself and forced the broom forward towards the three giant goals at the end of the field leaning forward she made the broom go so fast that she could feel her hair whipping around her face lashing her shoulders and the back of her neck but her adrenaline was rushing now and she was prepared to die before she gave into the fear coming to an abrupt incomplete stop hermione threw the quaffle as fast as she could and watched as it headed straight for the goal to the right but the keeper a seventh year slytherin she didntknow blocked it almost without thought and threw it to their chaser hermione turned knowing that she didnthave time to mope she needed to stay on the other chasers like glue it was imperative hermione moved lower as she caught up with the chaser and waited keeping her eyes peeled for gray she pulled up sharply on the broom to avoid a bludger and the chaser next to her was not nearly as fortunate hermione heard the sickening crack of breaking bones as the slytherin cried out dropping the quaffle without a second thought hermione lunged taking the quaffle in her arms speeding over the field hermione felt at peace despite the pace at which everything around her was moving she was once again racing towards the goal when she heard seamus shout pass i open hermione looked to her right and threw the quaffle aiming slightly forward she did this with one hand since she felt very uncomfortable relinquishing all control hermione watched as seamus scored and threw her hands excitedly in the air forgetting she was still moving forward at a breakneck speed her vision blacked out as she hit a very hard object of green and she felt not a single thing as she fell spiraling through the air broom right behind her something latched onto her arm and then thwack sweet numbness well thank goodness and you re awake exclaimed a high cheery voice and hermione sat up growling in pain no no no miss granger lay back down that was quite a fall and i ve mended more than a few bones on you they need time to settle hermione did as she was told and leaned back trying to ignore the pain in her side the pain in her arm and the throbbing aching pain in her skull what happened she groaned and madam pomfrey walked into her range of vision you were playing quite the game of quidditch i hear and you had a straight on collision with mr malfoy that one didntfair much better than you she stated as if this would make sense to hermione how did that happen she asked more to herself than to madam pomfrey but the nurse offered her opinion readily mr potter said you werentpaying attention suddenly hermione remembered malfoy she asked as she recognized the name yes he right over there quite a few bones broken on him as well but no one was there to break his fall madam pomfrey said a tinge of sadness in her voice fell forty three and a half feet straight down unconscious by the time he hit the ground i was told oh my hermione uttered craning her neck as far as the sore muscles would allow considering her injuries he going to be all right right hermione asked oh yes but it seems as though he had an injury before he fell and it doesntlook to me like he ll be playing quidditch for a while madam pomfrey informed hermione kindly he should have come straight to me for mending but that in the past he got a few weeks of rough healing on that hand and wrist to do before he can even consider picking up another broom and i will tell professor snape as much perfect hermione sighed draco loved quidditch and he was going to be absolutely pissed to know that she had taken that away to add to everything else she had obviously done wrong in his eyes i going to give you a sleeping drought and you ll be up and about in two hours that all the time your bones need to set but you re doing yourself no good worrying about him she said handing hermione a cup of green liquid that smelled of something fierce hermione cringed you have a lot to be thankful for hermione plugged her nose as she downed it and immediately felt it take affect if mr malfoy hadntcaught you who knows what would have happened and where you would have landed what hermione attempted to ask but it suddenly seemed as though she had forgotten how to shape the words on her lips she felt the shadows at the end of her mind creeping slowly towards the center and she gave into more sleep a n btw in the last chapter i just want to clarify that the quidditch season has started but the gryffindor chaser disappeared and they need a new one soon because there is a match in two weeks between editing and posting that little piece has gone missing sorry for the confusion if you experienced any well here it is people chapter 26 chapter 26 a message from salazar do you think he all right someone above his head whispered and draco felt himself sinking back into awareness did you see what he did it looked like he crushed his head said another voice not so quietly what did i tell you all said a sharp voice that made draco cringe i told you that if you were to be in here you had to be qui shhh he waking i saw him flinch at the sound of your voice no offense madam said a slightly familiar voice and draco ventured a look out of his eyelids barely opening them a crack look he opening his eyes draco opened his eyes to find himself being gawked at by a group of of gryffindors jumping up draco knocked a tray of food over and let out a howl of pain that made everyone in the room stand perfectly still mr potter mr weasley you both should know better than to come in here and act like this madam pomfrey said quietly as if any loud sounds would frighten draco now you and your group need to go mr malfoy has some rest to catch up on we just want to talk to him for a moment madam said the female voice of ronald weasley youngest sister one of the star gryffindor beaters we promise dontwe harry she nudged harry in the side and he nodded malfoy madam pomfrey asked and draco shrugged he knew that anything they had to say could not make a difference about what he had done and why yes he remembered he remembered watching her zoom towards him her broom cracking painfully through his ribs he remembered her flying forward on her broom hitting her head on the handle he remembered watching her fall through the air unconscious of the danger and he remembered lunging off of his broom grabbing her arm turning their bodies so that he would absorb the brunt of the fall and all this had taken place in a matter of seconds something so quick but it would change everything madam pomfrey nodded and waited for them to begin speaking well go on she said and ginny cleared her throat i afraid it a private matter madam she muttered and draco inwardly nodded so it was something they didntwant to say in front of pomfrey all right that made things a bit more serious oh very well but when i back out here in five minutes you three had better be gone now the rest of you can just wait outside she said shooing the small group of gryffindors out of the hospital wing and entering her office she slammed the door rather hard well draco urged crossing his arms over his chest as soon as he did this he regretted it as it turned out his ribs were still hurt and he sucked in a sharp breath and replaced his hands beside him i we want to know why you did that the girl said and draco looked to potter and weasley they didntseem nearly as curious so they knew draco mentally shrugged oh well at least they knew how to keep their gryffindor traps shut what exactly did i do draco asked clearly messing with the younger gryffindor you know potter spoke up and weasley took on an intimidating stance that he assumed was meant to well intimidate him weasel did a very poor job of it and draco was sure he would fear snape in a pink fuzzy frilly bunny suit more than he did this gangly sixteen year old wizard oh draco exclaimed saving your little friend he asked well i guess i shouldnthave but everyone has hero impulses every once in a while ask potter sure he gets the urge a lot more often than most sixteen year olds but hey we all have little flaws that irk the hell out of people cute weaselby sister said placing her hands on her hips sorry not interested draco drawled and harry took a small step forward did i not tell you this would be a waste of time we should have just gone straight to hermione the girl said and draco interest was peaked hermione hasntbeen exactly truthful with us lately harry said giving his guinea pet a sideways reproaching glance i figured it would be better to start at the root of the problem and work our way up well if that is the case then i guess you ve started at the wrong square mate draco smirked if i were you and i was looking for the root of the problem i would start with hermione she is one messed up gryffindor what do you know about her weasel the second asked as if he knew nothing at all and weasley rubbed his eyelids in frustration yes he definitely knew a lot more than you think what do you what did i say you three all four of them jumped at the crude intrusion of madam pomfrey angry voice out but no you don t miss weasley out madam pomfrey pointed at the door and when the three gryffindorks realized that they werentgoing to get anywhere this time they walked to the door looked back once then left as soon as madam pomfrey began bustling around him pouring odd colored liquids into a cup draco made a decision i leaving he said suddenly and he threw his legs over the edge of the bed gasping in pain i have work i have to do before monday draco added between breaths oh no you aren t she said in her severe voice without looking up from her concoction you ll be lucky if i let you go to classes on monday let alone be up and about tonight night it later than i thought in that case i had better hurry he said standing leaning against the bed to steady himself draco took deep breaths as he gathered his clothes together and just as he was closing the curtains madam pomfrey drew them further from his outstretched hand no assignment is worth risking your health i can write you a pardon draco grabbed the curtain tearing it from her grasp violently it not for school woman i have other duties here at hogwarts as a prefect and as an advanced arithmancy student not everything that goes on here is about god forsaken schoolwork he shouted while laboriously stripping off his clothing behind the curtain you really need to lay down right this moment malfoy draco shoved aside the curtain and stepped out fully clothed i dontneed to do anything right this moment except get moving he said and she sighed loudly at least take a bottle of this pomfrey said as she handed him a small purple bottle draco took the cap off and gave the substance a sniff he immediately recoiled what is it he asked feeling a pang of drowsiness it to help you sleep it will be very painful and hard for you to sleep with all those mending injuries and i should let you know they are going to be no picnic she said obviously resigned to the fact that draco had taken control of the situation and as you can see it very strong so use it sparingly draco nodded slipping the bottle into his cloak pocket draco walked to the door but paused as madam pomfrey called after him and no quidditch for at least three weeks she said and draco felt his heart skip a beat dontbe ridiculous we have a match against gryffindor next week draco stated picking lint off the shoulder of his cloak not realizing that his right hand lay limp at his side almost useless i know that and that is precisely the manner in which i would not suggest stressing those tendons in your hands and your bones i dontknow how those injuries occurred but you should know that all four of your larger knuckles were broken two of them in more than one place they were already starting to heal wrongly so i had to rebreak them while you were sleeping and begin mending them that why there little feeling she said and draco nodded darkly while trying to flex his fingers three weeks mr malfoy and if you refuse to listen i will have a word with your head of house to make sure you do not walk onto that pitch next week whatever he said and left he of course had no intentions of heeding madam pomfrey advice and due to the rivalry that there was between gryffindor and slytherin draco doubted snape would listen to the nurse anyway as draco walked through the darkened corridors he had to admit though that this hurt like a bitch how fast hermione must have been going he cringed as he remembered the sound his ribs had made but even this small movement caused him great pain and he let out a sigh slytherin dormitory or library draco asked himself he knew he had some major work to do before spring break he was pretty sure hermione hadntdiscovered the little mess he had made of their workspace and he would have preferred it to stay that way over the last week hermione had pointedly avoided any space in which they shared and she only spoke to him in classes when it was completely necessary which he couldntblame her for he had been very rude to her and he knew she was not going to put herself in any situation any time soon that could end with similar results but he had taken advantage of this time spent alone he had fixed almost all the documents by this time and had replenished most of their supplies that had met an unfortunate end he did not under any circumstance want hermione to know that he had lost his temper and had almost sacrificed their months and months of work for for emotions especially emotions that he couldntexplain to himself that would be library then he told himself and changed direction safely in the room draco could now let the pain show the stairs had been hell and he swore to god that this was the worst pain he had been in since the time his father hell it had to be almost ten years before had beaten him within an inch of his life draco didntremember what he had done all he knew was that it had been one of those lessons that kept you grounded even years later narcissa had almost left lucius then draco recalled but his father had threatened her with something far worse than death and as narcissa had explained to draco who had been in bed for two weeks straight she just wasntbrave enough narcissa didntthink draco remembered it but then again draco remembered a lot more than anyone expected as draco looked at the document he was currently cleaning up he was grateful that the ink damage on the original documents was very little and that only seven translation pages out of this folder were ruined it would take very little time to fix searching his pocket for his wand draco let out a sigh he would have to get that from madam pomfrey the next day nearly an hour after entering the room draco was more than ready to leave he was tired and his aching body was begging for sleep the tortured muscles and bones felt like fire beneath his flesh and he knew it was time to go when he nodded off and nearly hit his face on the table as his head had slipped out of his hands muttering a curse under his breath as he stood draco attempted to stretch this failed miserably and for a moment he wished he had done what madam pomfrey suggested and stayed in bed but with that thought came the knowledge that if he had stayed in bed he would not have gotten up for days madam pomfrey was overprotective controlling and very gracious with medication as well as stern affection draco slowly placed his folder on its designated shelf and turned towards the door stepping out into the hall he made sure to even out his ragged breaths and walk straight hiding his pain he didntknow what time it was but he assumed it must be late considering not a single person was out and about in the hallways his dreams returned to him with a frightful clarity all of the sudden and he felt a hint of foreboding in the air it seemed almost odd how quiet things were walking up a staircase draco breaths grew more ragged and it became more difficult to breath properly at all after he started to become light headed draco slowed his pace further and focused on staying aware it seemed like a nightmare this walk to the prefect dorms and draco could not help but wonder if he was going to make it mad hatter draco uttered outside the dorms and the tapestry swept aside to admit him into the commons as he moved deeper within the first thing he noticed was the sleeping form of miss hermione granger she sat in the large red and gold chair next to the fire with head leaned against the backing chin over her chest and a small black book lay across her stomach holding her page draco was momentarily struck by the image and did not move barely breathed had she been waiting for him it seemed odd that she after avoiding the dorms for the past week would come here willingly and wait in the commons without purpose walking forward silently he moved slowly through the common room and reached the small chair where he gently took the book from beneath her hands you read way too much he whispered under his breath and she stirred slightly at the sound of his voice draco lifted the book and tilted it towards the light so that he could see the writing the ten most influential wizarding families of the twenty first century draco opened it to the page she had been saving and was surprised to see malfoy written across the top of the page as he read through the list of names he recognized every single one as a child he had been forced to take a home class on family history great grandmother father mother myself diana draco reread the name twice hoping for an error i donthave a sister this book has misprinted draco angrily threw the book onto the table and turned his attention back to hermione who had not moved in the slightest why does it matter he asked himself referring to the bloodlines he wondered why she had this sudden interest in family trees and such when she had never really cared do you really know if she does or doesntcare he asked himself and draco was unable to answer that she acted as if she didntcare looking around draco eyes fell upon a throw blanket on the back of the hufflepuff couch and he grabbed it he placed the blanket over hermione sleeping figure and watched in fascination as she squirmed under the new weight but as soon as she adjusted leaning slightly to the right she fell still again and her breathing evened out in deep comfortable sleep draco yawned quietly and felt the need for sleep suddenly overwhelm him it was so late and he was so tired and until this moment he hadntrealized just how late and how tired he truly was he tore his drooping eyes from hermione and walked to the door to the slytherin dorms turning the handle he pushed it opened a little but then met some kind of solid resistance pulling it back he pushed again with the same result draco pushed one last time as hard as he could and stumbled into the room darkness enveloped him and then suddenly candles all around the room came to life with dancing flames he looked upon his room and uttered a frustrated curse everything was astray all of his possessions lay strewn across the floor and not one thing was in its proper place furniture was scattered and his mattress was flipped over against the armoire someone had been in here and draco knew it had to be the other slytherin prefect who else could enter the dorms kicking something draco cried out he turned in circles howling in pain while grabbing his toe fu draco voice faded and he released his foot silently forgetting the aching pain he felt wracking his entire body his eyes were now focused on the wall straight ahead of him where in green well written letters it said one can scrub one hands for hours hours upon hours but once a traitor to one own blood one hands will never come clean salazar it was not so much their presence as what they said that creeped draco out every child he knew knew that phrase muttered from salazar own mouth hundreds of years before those words held an immediate threat an immediate danger it was straight from the death eater handbook draco no longer able to control his body felt his knees go weak the mixture of fatigue pain and shock as well as fear was too much for draco even as he fell to the ground upon mangled books and feathers from his torn pillows and closed his eyes he felt safe even though his door was open he felt content to sleep how he was sleep at last sleep at last running through the forest draco felt his lungs pumping overtime to compensate for the lack of oxygen to his brain he had broken dumbledore rule no wait dumbledore was dead it didntmatter anymore the dark lord had taken over the school and every student who didntbend to his will was waiting to die hermione was already dead she had been one of the first to go but draco situation was no less than hers had been before she died he was waiting for death as well okay draco didntreally know if she was dead all he knew was that she was taken into the forest by a small group of death eaters the week before he sure hoped she was dead for her sake death eaters could be so cruel to women maybe that was why he was running maybe he still thought hermione was still alive maybe that was why he had left the sanctuary of the school he had to save her by now the hogwarts grounds would be teaming with werewolves centaurs alidores and many other very dark sinister creatures of the magical world anywhere outside of the school was unsafe now that dumbledore wasnthere suddenly draco heard a bark behind him and then a deep vicious growl turning his head only slightly he saw the lean dense body of a silver werewolf behind him stopping suddenly everything became a blur and when draco looked down he found himself drenched in the werewolf blood the malfoy dagger stuck deep within the werewolf chest i hope to god that wasntlupin he muttered screaming reached draco ears and it was nothing like he had ever heard in his life it was definitely human but it was animal like in its pitch desperate and it was begging for death as the realization hit home draco steeled himself against fear if he stumbled upon the camp of death eaters and hermione was still alive he would kill her but if she wasn t draco could only pray she wasn t walking forth draco moved stray branches aside with his injured arm watching his feet as he walked he avoided snapping branches loudly underfoot the last thing he needed was to give away his position he had to take them by surprise or there was no way he could take them especially not without his wand crucio draco didnteven have time to think before his nerves caught on fire falling to the ground he writhed in pain after a moment of nerve wracking mind breaking pain everything stopped his vision blurred draco looked around for the source of the curse even though he knew who it was you little worthless piece of slime said the snarling voice of his father draco grasped his dagger and unsheathed it where are you he called into the darkness of the forest show yourself you coward he shouted and his father stepped into the clearing a cloaked figure at his side it is time rasped the man at his father side yes lucius whispered yes it is no draco said no yes they approached blocking out the dull light of the moon and draco could only shout in protest he was too weak just too weak pain seared through draco left arm and he was jolted awake immediately regretting falling asleep drenched in sweat he sat up slowly and tried to ignore his injuries he had to talk to granger as soon as possible standing draco walked out into the common room and looked around shit he muttered as he realized it was a hogsmeade weekend all the students third year and above would be out wandering the wizarding streets of hogsmeade throwing his cloak around his shoulders and giving his disarrayed room a last look draco slammed the door to his room and resolved himself to go to hogsmeade despite the injury the walk would do to his already damaged body walking along the corridors back erect and face cleared of emotion draco began making a plan if they stayed over holiday spring break then they might have time to finish the spell and maybe if they were lucky they could test it though how they would do it made him shiver there was no question it had to be done and they were the ones that had been chosen to do it like it or not they were in it for the long haul together chapter 27 midnight broom ride hey hermione called a voice from behind her and hermione turned to face seamus finnigan and dean thomas where re harry and ron seamus asked and hermione waited for them to catch up they had too much homework and they figure they ll have enough fun over holiday to make up for a day in hogsmeade i on the other hand have finished all of my homework and have some shopping i d like to get done hermione explained and dean turned to seamus i ll catch up with you later he said hitting seamus lightly on the arm my brother asked me if i could get him some sour pixies for his birthday and i wanted to drop by the weasley wizard wheezes for bit to check things out and see how fred and george are doing i ll meet you back at the three broomsticks all right seamus nodded and dean bounded off in the other direction you want to get a butter beer or two seamus asked turning to hermione and she nodded she was a bit parched and she wanted a moment or two to set her bags down so far she had already gotten over half of the supplies she needed and she was beginning to feel their weight as they entered the familiar pub seamus led her to a table her ron and harry had never before sat at let alone noticed it was odd she suddenly realized being in hogsmeade without her best friends as she began rummaging in her money pouch for loose coins seamus reached over the table and tapped her hand i ve got it dontworry about it hermione gulped nodding thank you i ll pay you back hermione said and seamus dismissed her statement with a wave of his hand it would be rude if i didntpay he said anyways what would you two like interrupted madam rosmerta the barmaid a butter beer for both of us please seamus said handing her the correct coins and then some keep the change madam rosmerta replied with a short inclination of her head two butter beers frank she called back to the bar and a rather large burly man with dark hair behind the counter nodded how are you all doing today she asked cheerfully placing her wand which had been in her hand for cleaning behind her ear where re your little friends she asked hermione who retold her explanation never did agree with those n e w t s teachers lay the homework on thick the whole second term and students never have any time to run about with all of the studying that has to be done hermione nodded they procrastinate she said guiltlessly and rosmerta smiled well yes as do all children your age she commented and hermione smiled politely the smile did not reach her eyes and madam rosmerta must have noticed for a second later she said she had to be off new customers and all you certainly have a way with people seamus said with a smile and hermione nodded absently so what else do you have to do in hogsmeade he asked tapping his fingers nervously on the table i need to pick up a few extra rolls of parchment and i wanted to get a pocket full of sweets for harry and ron i hate it when the two of them have to miss these weekends hermione replied turning her attention back to seamus so ginny in hogsmeade hermione shook her head yes and seamus thanked the pretty barmaid as she brought their two butter beers to the table and handed them the warm drinks why wasntshe with you owe that hot seamus cursed intelligibly as he set his drink atop a napkin madam rosmerta had just set down she wanted to go see fred and george and i figured that would be a private thing oh thank you hermione said as she took her drink in her hands and set it calmly on the table she hasntseen them since summer hermione explained and seamus nodded taking a drink the last hogsmeade visit she was bogged down by homework flitwick assigned to prepare the fifth years for owl s i see seamus said clearly uninterested do you think you made the quidditch team seamus asked and hermione realized she hadnteven thought of it what i did was a stunt i didntmean for it to be serious and i sure harry would want someone more experienced as the new chaser i heard christoph was an exceptional chaser hermione said referring to the missing gryffindor but you re good too with a bit of training up i sure you could do just as well maybe better than christoph seamus said and i think i just the person to give you the proper lessons he said and hermione smirked oh do you she asked and he nodded taking a rather large drink i certainly do berkley isntnearly as graceful as he is aggressive and i think i just the in between you need to learn the ropes even as hermione stared at seamus mildly fascinated by his advances she could not help but let her thoughts wander to draco who was probably still fast asleep on the torn floor of the slytherin dorm she had no idea why he had done it but he had destroyed his dormitory and when she had left that morning he had been thrashing about calling out to his dead father she had wanted to soothe him or wake him or just to do something but but nothing she was scared seamus voice slowly came back into focus and hermione tried to pick up on the conversation so i was thinking we should start lessons as soon as possible considering what do you think hmm yes yes that would be a grand idea hermione replied as she sipped from her cup staring out the window hermione was startled to see draco malfoy staring in the window but it seemed that as soon as she blinked he was gone she was thinking about him way too much and then i blew up the castle with a large amount of margarine covered in napalm and i nearly lost my arm she heard seamus say and she was snapped from her thoughts you what hermione asked and seamus nodded slowly the expression on his face suggesting hurt mingled with disappointment oh i sorry seamus hermione began but he shook his head it fine i should have realized from the beginning that you were a bit preoccupied i just sorry i not as good a company as ron and harry he said slowly as he rose from the seat and set a few coins on the counter i dontknow if i ll have time to teach you after all he finished and stalked off out of the pub hermione let out a sigh and rubbed her temples good merlin hermione exclaimed lightly under her breath taking one more drink of the warm honey colored liquid hermione stood and left ready now to finish her shopping draco could not believe it granger and finnigan he would have thought she d have better taste than that that seamus was a clown for just a moment he had been ready to walk into the three broomsticks to get a butter beer maybe rip off a snifter of fire whiskey but as he opened the door through the window he saw hermione and seamus having a drink together and seamus had been into some in depth conversation draco had turned straight around and walked in the other direction the last thing he wanted to do was to talk to hermione in front of one of her gryffindor buddies or explain why he needed to have a word with her alone walking down the street draco walked into everything quidditch and had a look around as there always was there was a new state of the art broom model on display and a group of boys about draco age and a bit younger was huddled around it whispering in awe what this year gift to quidditch draco asked and a smaller boy near the back supplied him with an answer almost immediately it a new line of comets the boy said damn fast and the handling unsurpassable really draco drawled and he stepped forward pushing his way through the crowd some turned around to protest but the second they saw who was pushing them around they submitted and let him do what he wanted it great to be a malfoy draco thought to himself with a sneer after a quick visit to madam pomfrey in the morning draco pain had been alleviated by a little draught of heaven that she called indolentia after he left her office despite a small stomachache he had no pain whatsoever he thanked her magic as he pushed roughly through the tight crowd of gryffindors hufflepuffs slytherins ravenclaws and even grown men and women it a beauty muttered someone as draco approached and his eyes fell upon a very shiny and very new broomstick made of beach wood the new comet called the first in the neon tail series was lighter than any other and easy to handle the tail of the broom was what caught draco attention though every single twig of it was trimmed to perfection to allow for maximum aerodynamic speed draco was almost worried to ask its maximum speed considering its low weight and perfect shape it must be over one seventy five at least naturally it was expensive and draco out of habit reached for a pocket in his robe but suddenly stopped himself why on earth am i hesitating my mother sent me five hundred galleons this month alone and i have enough saved up to buy three of these looking at the broom draco bit his lip and sighed what would be the harm in indulging he hadntspent so much money in months and he had to admit the opportunity was very tempting so tempting in fact that he could not resist the urge walking away from the crowd around the glass draco stepped up to the counter where a sales person in a chudley cannons shirt smiled kindly and asked if he could assist how much is that comet in the display case it says price on request draco said and the sales person frowned obviously no one had yet asked it three hundred and fifty seven galleons twelve silver sickles and three bronze knuts a hefty price the man said and draco began rummaging through his pockets for his money purse only payable in cash no checks or i owe you and such cash the man reiterated and draco nodded pulling out a rather large pouch count it yourself it all there and then some draco said smiling at the disbelieving look on the man face the man did count it every galleon every sickle and every knut i just need you to sign here the man uttered shakily the model just came out last week it ll be all the rage for years you have made a worthy purchase mr uh he read draco slanted signature and almost jumped malfoy mr malfoy i apologize for being short with you i just i get a lot of clowns erm you know draco nodded giving a curt smile do i get my purchase today he asked and the man nodded vehemently chester this boy just bought the broom the salesman shouted catching not only the other worker attention but everyone in the shop get the one in the display case mr malfoy boy here i tell you just do it five minutes later draco walked out of everything quidditch a new broom in hand and a group of followers behind him exploring it with his eyes as well as his fingertips draco became consumed by buyer bliss what a beauty draco was concentrating so much on his new broom that he ran straight into someone knocking them over onto the pavement malfoy shouted the familiar voice of hermione granger and draco suddenly snapped out of his daze if there was one thing that could ruin buyer bliss he was sure its name was hermione granger watch where you re going look what you ve done she yelled and draco immediately bent over and began picking up scattered quills and parchment as well as sweets once everything was in order she finally looked at what he held in his hands a new broom i see she observed and i sure it top of the line brand new and utterly ridiculously priced she snarled and draco forced a grin would you even suspect any less he asked and walked off in the direction he had been headed he had been right he felt the buyer bliss deflate and die in his chest where it seemed to settle bent on making his chest heavy and tight of course she would ruin this of course he exclaimed as he walked to treasure isle ice cream parlor where he would wind down the day of excitement with a chocolate frog sundae with bertie bott flavored beans sprinkled on top since he had refused to let them wrap it the shop owner had insisted that draco take some anti rubbing paper to wrap it with when he was done admiring it and before he ordered his ice cream that was what draco did well if it isntthe little git crowed a voice from the corner and draco turned expecting to see the same group of gryffindors that always caused him trouble draco was unpleasantly surprised to see the new owners of a shop down the street from where he now sat these two were none other than fred and george weasley the infamous troublemakers that had dropped out of schooling the year before when the very ignorant dolores umbridge had taken over you got a new broom did you asked the other one and they walked forward taking the seats around draco you know how immature it would be if you both still did this sort of stuff now that you re all grown up and in the real world draco asked a placid smirk on his face honestly i dontsee how making a few bucks can make you any more confident i see you re still wearing the same clothes you ve been wearing since your fourth year you see here you little bastard began fred the one with a giant f on his sweater we earn our money and that makes it better than yours he explained and draco smiled come on guys he laughed money is money whether or not you earn it and some people just donthave enough of it he snapped a few extra coins arentgoing to get you into a mansion any time soon and that is what i have a mansion and i sure it teaming with death eaters since i am willing to bet my life savings that your house is their headquarters snarled george in draco same tone not a very impressive bet weasley george stood and for a second draco was scared they were going to jump him but by now he was in a fowl enough mood and he didntcare whether he was being malicious without reason he had provoked this and he was ready to deal with it let go i dunno how long deirdre can handle the shop on her own it pretty popular fred said pulling on george sweater you re one lucky little git spat george and draco smirked someday you wonthave your money or your luck to spare you and that when the biggest surprise will come george suddenly grinned as if he knew something draco didntdraco hated that look family and love are worth more than all the galleons in the world and you ll have neither he let out a short forced laugh and walked away side by side with his twin draco shrugged weasley comment off and stood walking to the counter he ordered his sundae ate it then left hogsmeade new broom in hand hermione walked into the room and wasntvery surprised to see draco there sitting at his normal spot acting as if she hadntentered the room she was sure he had felt comfortable coming in the room and for that she resented him now she was no doubt weeks behind after the day she had had she was surprised she was still standing let alone composed as she had entered the castle from hogsmeade she had been surrounded by a large crowd of gryffindors offering congratulations as well as condolences and when she discovered what each was for she nearly fainted congratulations on making the team parvati had said and this was the fifth time someone had said something of the likes to her and hermione decided to ask why what are you talking about i only tried out yesterday i so sorry hermione i just heard about crookshanks someone else interrupted and hermione felt her heart nearly stop again as she remembered what she had asked hagrid found him dead in the forbidden forest poor fool probably wandered in there to chase some mice and ended up werewolf food someone she didntknow replied hermione suddenly steeled her emotions and remembered the good she had been made gryffindor new chaser but even as she forced the thought she knew she would have chosen crookshanks over any quidditch position on any team in the world i see you re hard at work she stated dryly as she grabbed her folder and took her seat across the table we need to step up the progress he replied and hermione stopped what she was doing pushing thoughts of her dead cat to the back of her mind has something happened does it have to do with your dream she asked and draco looked momentarily surprised what do you know about my dream he asked sharply and hermione rolled her eyes i heard you thrashing about this morning now what is it draco stopped shuffling through his papers and met her eyes for the first time in the last almost week and a half i think you know who is going to try something soon draco said i think he might make a move against the school dontbe silly hermione began voldemort wouldnttry anything with dumbledore around she said not even voldemort is that crazy so you dontmind saying his name draco observed then shrugged in my dream dumbledore wasntthere he let the weight of his words sink in before continuing we need to finish this hogwarts will need this spell soon how can you know that she asked and he shoved his left arm towards her i can feel it he said lifting up his sleeve an angry red mark scarred the pale flesh of draco inner arm and hermione sighed it looks like you scratched yourself hermione was unwilling to believe what he said it was too much dumbledore gone hogwarts in danger he had finally lost it draco had finally lost his mind i dontknow what that mark is supposed to prove she said and draco pulled his arm away do you happen to notice its location he asked and hermione thought about it it was his left forearm but what could that have to do with anything draco she whispered fear reaching out at him you dontthink hermione eyes opened wide as she shook her head you probably scratched yourself when you tore apart your dormitory last night draco it can be a number of things i didnttear apart the dormitory draco said interrupting her train of thought the sooner she believed him the sooner they could start trying to make others believe it as well someone else did that no one else knows our password draco hermione lectured and i was in the common room reading dontyou think i would notice if someone came waltzing in the common room and started to blow your room apart what time did you fall asleep draco asked if she didntsee anyone come in then there was a chance she had been bewitched asleep i i dontremember the exact time all i remember was sitting in the chair in front of the fire reading she said and her voice trailed off into thin air exactly you want to know how i know it wasntme besides the obvious reasons draco asked and hermione nodded i found a message scrawled across my wall i knew it would be cleaned up before i got back from hogsmeade so i wrote it down he pulled a piece of parchment out from his pocket and tossed it across the table one can scrub one hands for hours hours upon hours but once a traitor to one own blood one hands will never come clean she read aloud and draco waited salazar hermione asked i know i ve heard this quote before hermione said suddenly throwing the paper down on the table top as she began to rummage through her book bag i know it in here somewhere binns went over this two weeks ago i know it ah here it is chapter eighteen she set the book on the table and began skimming with her eyes salazar slytherin the founder of the house of slytherin is well accredited for creating most of the philosophies voldemort followers the death eaters adopted in their rituals and beliefs as he once said one can scrub one hands for hours hours upon hours but once a traitor to one own blood one hands will never come clean voldemort has proven this saying to be true over and over again hermione closed the book shortly and placed it back in her bag death eaters hermione asked draco nodded straight out of the handbook his voice had taken on a low quality that hermione found disturbing great hermione whispered grabbing the piece of parchment and tearing it to shreds everything else had to go wrong today and now this she shouted aboleo the last bits of paper left on the table were incinerated and hermione just sat there for a moment looking at the small pile of remaining ashes is everything okay draco asked and he recoiled at the look hermione gave him does it look like everything is okay because if it does then i am better at this whole emotion hiding thing than i thought or you re just stupid she snapped and draco laughed you want to talk about it he asked quietly and hermione smiled shook her head and brushed the ashes off of the table and onto the floor where they disappeared she remembered doing that cleaning charm on the room it guaranteed no messes and no dust just swipe everything off the table and it was gone if only life worked like that you dontwant to talk about it or just not with me he asked and hermione propped her chin up on her fist staring at him through sad eyes a bit of both actually she replied i on the gryffindor quidditch team she said suddenly a minute later after he had already gone back to work looking up he gawked you ve got to be joking he said after what happened potty sorry is still going to let you on the team he asked and hermione nodded and that not the worst of it she admitted bitterly i dontknow how to play my first game is in less than a week and i pissed the other chaser that was going to teach me how to play off today and now he doesntwant to help me she added finnigan draco asked biting his cheek when hermione nodded i would say not to worry about it but i figure if i were in your same situation i d want to break an arm or something to get out of it draco said with a smirk but hermione didntsmile back after another moment of silence draco saw her second defense give way and tears filled her eyes what is it hagrid found crookshanks today she sobbed refusing to let the tears fall down her face he been missing for months now and i was afraid to admit to myself he was gone but hagrid says he been dead for a while weeks even crookshanks is your cat draco asked trying to feel empathetic but finding trouble doing so considering it was just a cat not just a cat he was smarter than a cat much smarter and he d know better than to go running off into the forbidden forest he smarter than some stupid werewolf she exclaimed and draco figured that a werewolf was the cause of death for her little friend there was an uncomfortable silence and draco waited for it to be over he had no experience with this sort of thing crying girls he had seen pansy cry once the whole time they had been together and that was when she discovered she wasntgoing to be the mother of the heir to the malfoy fortune standing draco walked around the edge of the table and knelt next to her and he winced in pain his pain was returning and hermione could see it in his eyes i ve hurt you badly then she uttered and draco shook his head no not at all it only hurts when i move he replied and hermione smiled draco reached up slowly and hesitantly brushed a strand of hair out of her face he wanted to look into her beautiful eyes when he said this it all right to miss him but as long as you remember crookshanks life doesnthave to be over his words seemed to be exactly what she wanted to hear because she bit her lip and threw her arms around his neck after a moment of submitting draco pulled away and stood hermione looked up at him many questions on her face i ll teach you he said suddenly and hermione looked confused since your gryffindor friend wontteach you how to play i will i ve been playing quidditch since i was old enough to grip a broom he explained and the confusion on her face didntfade what he asked are you the same boy who knocked me over in hogsmeade she asked completely serious that depends he began are you the same girl who tried to kill me yesterday he asked and she nodded her head then there your answer half an hour later after breaking into the quidditch shed un wrapping his new broom and gearing hermione up both of them stood on the quidditch pitch ready to fly draco who was also wearing his uniform shivered it nearly midnight and if we get caught we won t he stopped her and handed her his broom take it he snapped and she did as he said now show me how you get up in the air setting the broom on the ground hermione jumped as draco lunged forward what re you doing he asked madam hooch taught us to oh that old prune she old fashioned and that for beginners he said you donthave to set it on the ground he said his voice growing softer and less stern now straddle the broom and lift off be careful not even i have ridden this broom yet and i afraid your life wouldntcover the damages he said jokingly and hermione hoisted her leg over the other side of the broom and paused now hermione kicked off of the ground and felt herself grow queasy as she picked up speed boy was this broom fast leveling it out with the slightest touch hermione looked around she was more than fifty feet in the air and draco was now just a dot on the ground below he motioned her to come down and she leaned forward on her broom tilting it only slightly and she sped towards the earth no no pull up pull up he shouted and she did so just in time she hovered about a foot from the ground and draco looked so pale she thought he might faint hermione inwardly hoped it was concern for her safety as well as the broom s all right he said slowly letting out a breath i guess we start from the beginning he said offering her a hand to help her off the broom once on the ground hermione looked at him her face flushed with an odd excitement that broom is amazing i barely touch it and it goes as fast as a lamborghini she practically shouted in joy lamborghini he asked and hermione laughed out loud i ll have to explain it to you sometime she said laughter still in her voice now let get started for real i want to learn all right then first i want to teach you proper mounting technique he said first straddle the broom and make sure your grip is in the right place he demonstrated this and hermione watched with rapt attention slightly bend your knees like this to give yourself plenty of room to correct any lift off mistakes you may make hermione nodded absorbing the information like a sponge now i ll show you how to lift off she gestured him to get on with it and he prepared himself going through the motions which by now were second nature draco mounted and kicked of with the wind rushing through his hair draco made sure not to add anything extra to his demonstration hermione needed to focus on the basics and when she felt comfortable creating her own technique he was sure she would draco leveled out and then slowly tilted the broom forward ready to touch down draco made sure to concentrate on landing correctly so hermione could see how it was done and when he was finally on the ground she clapped that was bloody brilliant she said and draco couldntbelieve how excited she was you think you re ready to try it on your own again he asked and hermione bit her lip i scared she murmured and draco handed her the broom then i ll go up with you the first time does that work for you draco asked and hermione nodded slowly all right i ll get on first now watch how i bending my knees he exaggerated the movement and hermione nodded all right now get on no put your hands here he grabbed her by the hands and wrapped her arms around his middle now pay attention he mumbled barely turning his head and hermione felt her mouth go dry they were so close here we go he warned one two three draco pushed off as hard as the muscles in his legs would allow and they zoomed upward into the darkened sky hold on tight he shouted and he felt hermione tighten her grip around his middle you can open your eyes now we re level he whispered and he felt hermione tension loosen as she looked around that was amazing she said quietly and draco leaned back slightly savoring the feel of hermione warmth behind him up here it seemed like they were in an entirely different world and it was all theirs it even better in the heat of battle he informed her and hermione laughed laying her head on his shoulder i d hardly call quidditch battle she said you ve never played a game of quidditch he elaborated a gust of wind buffeted the light broom and draco gripped slightly tighter on the handle we should go inside now hermione said hesitantly it late we have school tomorrow and the wind is beginning to pick up draco would have given any excuse to keep them up here together alone but he could think of no logical excuse who says it has to be logical not just yet draco said turning slightly draco came face to face with hermione whose emotions were displayed so blatantly on her face that he could only smile softly something that felt so natural on his lips he wondered why he didntdo it more often her hair was blowing behind her in the wind as they moved slowly over the pitch not caring if it was night or day not caring if the castle was on fire or even if it was raining and the world was coming to an end you re going to do just fine on saturday he conceded and hermione did not reply only looked deeper into his gray eyes tracing her jaw line softly with his fingertips draco took hermione face in his palm and leaned forward it would have been uncomfortable had he not shifted slightly leaning most of his weight off of the broom but when their lips met he realized it was well worth it any discomfort at this point was worth feeling her warmth and emotion flood through him forcing him into undeniable bliss there was only one word draco could think of as they drifted along above the pitch completely oblivious to all else nirvana a n i was so listening to three doors down new song called let me go and i think it affected the way this went if you dontlike it tough i do btw look up nirvana and you ll know why this word adds to what i am describing for those of you too lazy or apathetic to care here it is the definition straight out of a freakin dictionary nirvana the final freeing of the soul from all that enslaves it tear another quick transition chapter but this is well worth what coming up how does heather feel about all this that going on we will find out i haventwritten it yet so i have no idea either chapter 28 the worth of a slytherin draco lay on his back staring at the ceiling hands folded behind his head wow he thought and rolled over shifting positions by now he had realized he wouldntbe sleeping tonight his head was swimming with too many new questions new ideas and new feelings that he could not suppress licking his lips draco rolled over once again shit he said sitting up there was no point in even lying down anymore it only made him even more restless standing he began to pace what was he going to do he suddenly asked himself the thought hadntstruck him as he had been gliding over the quidditch pitch but now it was the only thing that he could think about besides he groaned as his thoughts went down that path and he forced them back onto subject no one could know what had transpired between them of course but he couldntkeep screwing with her head like this that he knew he remembered what she had said outside her gryffindor portrait hole and as he thought of it the image came alive in his mind thank you hermione said handing draco his broom which she had been carrying around almost possessively she looked so shy now that they were back in the castle draco realized no thank you propping his broom up against the wall he leaned his left hand against the wall blocking her path not that it needed blocking and leaned forward tipping her chin up with his right hand as his lips were pressed over hers one simple fact made everything they were doing okay she was kissing him back a moment later draco could feel the question floating in the air and he had no answer he could say nothing that could dispel her fear and he could say nothing at all that would make this whole thing make sense in his own mind but as it turned out he didntneed to say anything it was fun hermione asked herself furiously once she stood safely on the other side of the door it was fun hermione sighed i cantbelieve i said it turning around hermione eyes met the saddest scene she had ever witnessed half of the gryffindor house was scattered about the common room some were asleep some were bored and some were angry hermione had to admit that the two angriest faces were those of harry and ron we wanted to be the first to tell you you know harry began but then parvati told us she told you and you went storming off so we decided to throw you a welcome to the team party he finished his tone growing lower every word assuming that you would come back that is i i but hermione was speechless she couldntfind one word to display how sorry she was and even though she searched for something to say nothing she said would make things all right she at least wanted to lie they deserved at least a lie but her tongue felt trapped between her teeth and her jaw refused to open most of the team gone to bed we have to keep up on our academics and there school tomorrow ron said i told amber i couldntgo to her birthday party because i had duties to my own house my own friends my own teammate ron said harshly and hermione tapped her foot well harry asked and hermione shrugged not knowing what to say well what where were you he asked and hermione suddenly felt very attacked it was her business where she had been and how fair was it that they were having this conversation in front of everyone else in their house that is none of your business she replied coldly and harry nodded you were with that git werentyou he stated and hermione glared werentyou he shouted and suddenly two more gryffindors in the room were forced to listen to their fight against their will as they were woken from sleep it none of your business harry hermione roared where do you go at night that something i d like to know hermione shouted turning this around on him and harry threw a harsh look to ron who recoiled well answer that i dontanswer to you he said and stood walking forward very slowly hermione saw the look on his face and felt temporarily guilty she had meant to bring that up in private oh and i answer to you she asked placing her hands on her hips i your captain harry shouted he had begun to ascend the staircase into the boy dormitories but now he turned back placed himself straight in front of her leveling their eyes on the quidditch pitch she replied scathingly i thought we were pretty good friends but the moment since sirius died you ve closed yourself off in this alternate universe of pain and i ve all but moved on harry you shut me out and that fine but you have to expect the same from everyone else hermione said her voice lowered only a pitch by now every gryffindor in the common room was listening which didnthelp her temper at all haventyou ever heard the saying treat others how you yourself wish to be treated she asked and harry nodded curtly take it to heart but i never knew all this trouble would be caused by one sleazy slimy little git of a slytherin now he had hit a cord and hermione was prepared to let him have it when she paused best explain this in a tone he ll actually hear it not about draco at all harry she lectured then it about you and how you feel about him which isntreasonable in the least if you were to take one look beyond that green and silver scarf those cold ambitious eyes and the dysfunction running through his veins then you would you see what i do the worth of a slytherin she spoke her voice taking on a preaching quality and harry looked as if what she had just said shook him he not just a slytherin either harry he a human he a malfoy yes and he a jerk but he not a death eater we re fighting death eaters here not slytherins i thought that as gryffindors we were supposed to look beyond houses and blood and reputation but i guess in some ways were are all just as bad as slytherins in our close mindedness hermione turned to the left and walked down the stairs into the girls dormitories slamming the door behind her quite the interesting chapter to write let me say right here i had to keep so many people in character that it became harder and harder as i wrote i like it though and i think you might too i looking forward to writing the quidditch match very soon well here it is chapter 29 the ancient room the start of the week before holiday went smoothly and everyone was growing more and more excited about the upcoming quidditch match against slytherin and gryffindor taking place on the saturday before break everyone knew the game was going to be phenomenal if not more but along with the excitement came the tension there were more house points lost for fighting during the start of the week than there had been the whole first term for all the houses put together besides inter house tension though there was a certain unease among gryffindors a rumor had circulated school that the famed trio was at odds miss granger what spell do we use to straighten ribbons and such professor flitwick asked and sighing hermione picked up her wand uttered the latin word perfectly pointing it at the blue ribbon on her desk and the ribbon took the spell just as was expected perfectly excellent job miss granger fifteen points for gryffindor now everyone else try no neville you have to point it at the object like so you look bored said the voice of amber as she took the unoccupied seat next to hermione who nodded without harry and ron pranking flitwick just doesnthave the same appeal hermione said slowly twirling her wand between her fingertips i hate it when we re fighting hermione uttered they miss you too you know she replied opening hermione book to the correct place and pushing it in front of her we re supposed to be practicing i ve memorized the book already she said pushing the book away i ve got all the practice on these stupid spells that i ll ever need she snapped straightening spell she mumbled and growled as she dropped her wand and it hit the table with a quiet thwack why are you fighting amber asked carefully ron wouldntsay a word and when i asked harry his nostrils flared and his face went red it must be serious no hermione began no they just want me to do something i dontfeel the need to do turning her large brown eyes onto amber she uttered a soft sigh do you feel uncomfortable dating ron at all with you being in ravenclaw and all i mean she asked and amber smirked sometimes because there always a certain secretive manner about us neither of us wants to reveal too much about our house but then again we get over it amber replied tucking her wand behind her ear well then why is ron so against inter house relationships she asked is that what this is about amber asked and hermione nodded i see ronald being a little hypocrite again but this time hermione shook her head slowly the odd thing is i know where he coming from and i ve been there hermione grumbled but now i see the other side of things and they will have none of it who is it amber asked and hermione eyes went wide and she shifted uncomfortably who who she asked avoiding the question completely this other side you re talking about amber said not prepared to take any of hermione evasive attitude someone so completely wrong for me hermione confided letting her inhibitions fall draco malfoy amber asked and hermione gawked uttering a curse how did you know hermione questioned did ronald say something to you because if he did i ll have his head as a mantle piece no no amber exclaimed it was a guess i swear not even our divination teacher guesses that well now tell me how you knew hermione demanded in a whisper if you practice with me i swear i ll tell you professor flitwick is looking at us and he isntvery happy hermione threw a glance behind her flicked her wand and the ribbon curled now you try hermione gestured amber did and immediately hermione saw a flaw in her technique no your wave should be looser you re using the wave technique we used for the folding spell which is sharper that why your ribbon is creasing it puts too much pressure on the cloth and it folds hermione explained and amber nodded unsure trust me now try it again amber flicked her wand loosening her movements and the ribbon curled perfectly wow amber said turning to hermione you really know your stuff ron was right speaking of the git what else was he right about hermione asked with a smile as she returned to her earlier question he didntsay anything amber said nervously i saw you guys last night along with everyone else in the astronomy club suddenly hermione felt as if she could die no she wished she would you cantbe serious hermione uttered her face flushing in fear embarrassment and worst of all guilt i am but you should know that when people started joking and conversation was getting randy i told them to keep their traps shut amber said but hermione was beyond listening you didnttell ron or harry did you she asked and amber shook her head hermione let out a sigh of relief are there gryffindors in the astronomy club hermione asked as the thought hit her mind one hermione nodded this news wasntso bad ginny ron sister is in it very good at spotting celestial objects she didntseem all that happy about it now that i think about it her heart stopped again i cantbelieve it how can i tell draco he going to have a fit wait are there slytherins in the astronomy club she asked her voice trembling honestly and do pigs fly amber asked with a smirk but hermione found that she could not return the gesture she was going to have quite the conversation with ginny later she was sure i imagine this is going to be all over school within a day time hermione asked resigning herself to the truth of things oh sooner than that amber said honestly the worst thing about all this is that ravenclaws have friends on both sides of the tracks some of us will tell gryffindors and some of us will tell slytherins there no way around it you and draco are going to have to face things as they are i dontknow if either of us are ready for that hermione stated and amber flicked her wand again re curling the ribbon then maybe you two arentready to have any kind of relationship then hermione was about to argue but found no point amber was right i should have been a ravenclaw draco wandered through the hallways trying to avoid any type of gathering if draco thought it was hell when he saved hermione life then this had to be some kind of sick joke he couldntwalk anywhere without hearing about it didntthey all realize that he had been there at first he had tried to play it off as some kind of joke or elaborate plan to humiliate gryffindors but that charade only lasted two seconds when he saw hermione in the hall and turned the other direction blushing like a shy teenager then again he thought who says draco malfoy shouldntbe able to snog whomever he so wishes after all who better to snog to get back and harry potter than his little mudblood sidekick and weasley girl toy as draco dealt with all of the rumors floating about he realized the four major differences between the houses hufflepuff thought that draco and hermione were in love and wanted to end the centuries long feud between houses ravenclaw thought it was teenage lust and gryffindors and slytherins though pretty much believed the same thing that draco was using hermione to get back at and humiliate gryffindor house by shaming one of their most famous representatives in deduction hufflepuffs were ignorant ravenclaws simplified things way too much and gryffindors and slytherins alike were paranoid and devious who knew the two houses that fought the most and were odd with one another all the time were the two that turned out to think the most alike draco should have expected it though why would something good happen to him and end up to be a good thing in the end it never really ever happened that way and he figured he was trying too hard to see things through rose colored glasses turning right draco walked down a familiar hallway since the year had begun he knew of several new passages that led to the same places this hallway the hallway he had been attacked in at the beginning of the year he found out led to the transfiguration classroom although he had no idea how the straight and narrow hallway made it up a few flights of stairs walking through the darkened corridor draco felt the slightest urge to look upon the painting it was weird he suddenly realized how whenever he was in this hallway the painting seemed to call to him draco suddenly stopped turning to the wall he saw the painting it was just as he remembered it except he could tell it had been restored since he saw it last draco reached forward and lightly ran his fingertips across the frame the painting was so lifelike that draco almost felt the fabric flutter under his hand almost felt the heat of this woman eyes upon him almost felt the evil that must have surrounded her when her portrait had been painted draco shuddered enter whispered a soft voice and draco jumped enter draco looked around for the source of the voice and upon finding none he re focused his eyes on the painting shit draco stumbled backwards throwing his arms behind himself to catch his weight before he fell feeling the sturdy wall draco looked around wildly she had moved the portrait had moved the thought was absurd but he knew what he saw looking into the woman dark brown eyes the irises disappeared as they rolled into the back of her head and she let out a blood curdling shriek that made draco hands fly over his ears enter came the voice again and suddenly draco felt ice flow through him enter whispered the voice of the bloody baron and draco realized too late what was happening enter draco felt his arm raise and he held his hand parallel to the portrait which hadntyet stopped screaming and everything suddenly went silent enter the ice cold feeling went away and draco was left alone in the hallway or so he thought enter draco felt his energy drain as he stood there and the portrait disappeared leaving only a wide golden arched doorway enter he stepped forward and entered the dark room it reeked he noticed like decay luminescence serendai the candles all along the wall lit up to reveal a scene of horror if draco thought he had seen something this bad before he was terribly mistaken turning to his right he got sick all over the floor malfoy what on ea the firm voice of mcgonagall stopped in horror as she stood beside him go go tell dumbledore stone gargoyle password is berry blossom go draco sprinted down the hallway as fast as he could stone gargoyle berry blossom how the hell was he supposed to know what she was talking about draco suddenly skidded to a stop stone gargoyle draco stepped forward inspecting the mean looking and very ugly stone gargoyle berry blossom he whispered as if testing when nothing happened he stepped closer and rose his voice berry blossom the gargoyle leapt aside revealing a rather large opening though draco wasntexactly shocked to see the spiral staircase within the walls move slowly up he wasntnonchalant either this was where dumbledore lived this was very clever stepping onto the moving staircase draco watched in mild awe as he rose but after a moment it stopped moving and when draco turned around he was facing the innards of albus dumbledore headmaster office hello mr malfoy said a wheezing voice from the corner may i know to what do i owe this very unexpected visit i sir oh over here come have a seat draco followed the voice and saw dumbledore desk he motioned for draco to sit down and draco never refused an order lemon drop dumbledore asked as he pressed a tray forward sir it sort of urgent immediately dumbledore demeanor changed yes he said setting the lemon drops down what is it i dontknow how it happened so i wontbother trying to explain it but i found a room a room i am pretty sure no one was ever meant to find draco began and dumbledore nodded for him to continue inside there were bodies who do you know who they are dumbledore asked and draco nodded i only recognized one one of them is pansy parkinson she s dead they re all dead draco uttered disbelievingly i see dumbledore rose and grabbed his purple cloak off the rack to his right stay here and wait for me i suppose minerva sent you the old man asked and draco nodded where would she be then first floor corridor behind the durmstrang tapestry draco replied it about half way up the hallway dumbledore gave him a quick nod and left in quite the hurry that draco sat dazed and confused why was he to wait here great draco muttered he was going to miss transfiguration not at all the class to miss but then again mcgonagall was going to miss it too so no big loss he supposed but after transfiguration draco had defense against the dark arts and well alias dark was not too understanding of absences as of late she had taken thirty points off of a hufflepuff the week before because after a week of standing undiscovered in a trick sinking stair he had needed to spend half a week in the hospital wing recovering from emaciation and dehydration looking around the room draco marveled at how calm of an atmosphere it had despite what had just happened draco felt oddly safe and secure in here there was a rustling in the corner and draco turned looking upon a bright red bird a phoenix could this be the famous fawkes my father told me all about it looked so young but then again draco recalled phoenixes never died they were reborn from their ashes highly figurative as well as literal draco thought with a smile uneasily draco broke his eyes from the creature it looked at him as if he could see right through him those piercing bird eyes made draco uncomfortable for more than one reason letting his eyes wander they fell upon the sorting hat draco hadntseen the sorting hat up this close for a very long time six years in fact draco stood and crossed the room reaching up to the high shelf without regard to any personal laws he was braking draco brought the hat down upon his head what the hat shouted and draco cringed sorting time again and i thought i had all this time wait you re not a first year there more magic in here than a textbook ah draco malfoy is it i was curious hat whether or not you could tell me a few things draco approached cautiously and the hat laughed a great booming laugh greater than the stitches in its brim i ll tell you if i will or wontbut ask your questions without worry the hat replied and draco nodded dontshake me off you re head a lot bigger than most those who try me on not a very snug fit if you know what i mean no i really don t draco replied and the hat coughed i was wondering well what i assume every student wonders whether i chose you the right house or not draco lightly nodded well looking through your head right this moment i see that you are indeed a slytherin at heart that has not changed at all but some of the things i see in here you have barred from yourself may they be dark or darker but that is your own business the hat explained now is that all or is there more we need to discuss draco bit his lip he wanted to know if a relationship between a gryffindor and slytherin could ever work out but draco doubted with all of his logic that this was something the hat could answer i was wondering if you could tell me the major difference between myself and let say harry potter the house extremes eh the hat asked well from the top of my head i could not tell you yes i have been in the boy head and i am most definitely in yours now but there are things about the potter boy that are unstable ever changing granted you are much more close minded than mr potter and he is much less able to forgive but there are things that shaped you both that are very similar to each his own the saying goes is there anything no hat said a voice from the corner and draco pulled the hat off turning that ll be quite enough dumbledore said draco please replace the hat draco placed the hat back in its place upon the shelf and turned back around take a seat we have some things to discuss the man said tucking his long silvery beard under the table draco took his seat across from dumbledore and waited glaring odd into space hands folded over his chest defiantly did you know that room was there mr malfoy dumbledore asked and draco eyes shot up he shook his head no sir then you have stumbled upon a very unique find mr malfoy it turns out that we have discovered a new secret addition that dear salazar made to our school upon construction a private study to be sure dumbledore explained it hasntbeen opened in a long while then how did pansy get in there draco asked and why couldntshe get out i highly doubt she would have gone in there if she knew she wouldntbe able to get out draco stated plainly and there was no way she could have known we have discovered a very odd defense mechanism that this room has only purebloods can open it unassisted and only purebloods can leave unassisted draco nodded slowly until it suddenly hit him but pansy was a slytherin not only pureblooded witches and wizards can be of a slytherin personality i assure you that ms pansy parkinson was of mixed descent dumbledore said slowly wiping the shocked look of draco face why would voldemort leave her to die draco asked though he knew the answer he knew everything there was to know about the way voldemort operate in fact if one could major in dark lord trivia draco was sure he could my guess is that voldemort viewed ms parkinson as expendable gave her some way to gain entrance in the room to give false hope of escape and then left her there to die the old man explained wearily sounds like him draco muttered and dumbledore nodded darkly what about the other bodies who re they we have identified two of them so far as the previous defense against the dark arts teacher you met her ms knock i think her name was and then there was a gryffindor student that went missing over holiday break a young one collin creevey to be sure he said and draco almost gasped aloud collin creevey the little one all the gryffindors flocked to protect have you told the gryffindors yet draco asked choking on his question and dumbledore shook his head slowly why i want to tell them draco said shocking himself with his own words i need to tell hermione this news wontbe easy and i think that we should keep it personal again draco was not all too unpleasantly surprised by his sudden interest in being considerate dumbledore nodded you may go dumbledore said wheezily and draco stood walking to the door in a few short strides and mr malfoy dumbledore began and draco turned back i would prefer it if some other students didntfind their way into the room with your guidance draco smirked and no more late night broom rides you should know that from my window you can see the quidditch pitch quite clearly even in the dead of night draco mouth went dry so now everyone knew draco threw open the door and left quickly as draco sped through corridor after corridor he grabbed hold of the first slytherin he saw which just so happened to be the slytherin he wanted you little bastard draco past pushing crabbe into the nearest wall you knew you re the one that led her into that room to slowly die and rot away same with that little gryffindor and our teacher draco shouted i have no idea what you re talking about you little prick now i would appreciate it if you took your hands off of me crabbe said dontyou play innocent it doesntsuit your face draco pulled his wand you were the only one that didntseem at all worried about goyle death and you werentin the crowd of slytherins at the foot of the stairs when they attacked granger draco said and surprisingly crabbe face broke into a grin how could i of he asked and draco grinned suddenly thinking like a slytherin you re in voldemort inner circle and voldemort knew about the room he told you what to do whom to do it to and when pansy was just a plot in a plot draco said and crabbe nodded but why the gryffindor for sport crabbe stated simply all of them were just pieces in a puzzle draco uttered in a dark tone and are you at all disappointed he asked no draco said putting his wand away he was dealing with more than a murderer he realized he was dealing with a death eater and his wand was not going to do anything at this point not at all draco walked away breathing hard and had to force down vomit as he thought of the expression he had seen on the young collin creevey face now he had to tell hermione everything and he doubted he could take away her pain making the prospect of her tears difficult to face with mixed feelings draco admitted to himself that this was just the event that would bring the gryffindor dream team back together pushing him further away from hermione draco brushed his hands together washing his mind free of all inhibition for the first time in his life draco wanted to be honest an awkward chapter to write i have to say i dontknow if i want to add a lot of fluff after all it draco friggin malfoy we re talking about not cedric not exactly a whole chapter but i wouldntcategorize it as a transition either i just hope you guys can help me tweak this one looking for serious suggestions here i like the quidditch part but it very long chapter 30 why gryffindors and slytherins dontmake good snogging partners hermione mounted her broom bending her knees slightly to allow for error gripping the handle as she had been shown she poised her muscles for ascent draco had offered to lend her his new comet but she had refused saying that he needed it though he had insisted otherwise she had refused to take it the whistle was blown and hermione pushed off hair pulled into a secure pony she didnthave to worry as wind rushed through her hair here we go she could feel her nerves doing some kind of dance in the pit of her stomach but looking over the field her safety was reassured she had draco ginny harry and ron the four people she believed would give their lives for her ducking hermione dodged a bludger and swerved to the right she had to follow the other chasers which meant paying attention leaning forward on the handle hermione accelerated and caught up with seamus who she saw had the quaffle you got it she asked and seamus tossed the red ball to her hermione caught in unawares nearly fumbled the ball but upon curling it into her hand she drew it inward and cradled it i ll take that as a no hermione felt her heart beating wildly in her chest as she weaved in and out of other players on the field towards the goals at the other end hermione was suddenly stopped in her tracks as a bludger zoomed directly in front of her broom but she was unable to completely avoid collision she was wrenched forward as it hit the right side of the tip of the broom and she screamed hermione seamus shouted holding his hands out toss it here as hermione plunged forward she tossed the ball up behind her and prepared for a really rough landing shit she muttered looking down at her broom trying to land normally hermione was ready when she finally hit the ground and sprawled forward over one shoulder i need another broom she shouted somewhere off to the side as she stood and as soon as the wood hit her palm she was up in the air again looking for the other chasers she was up in the air in enough time to see that seamus had scored and hermione let out a loud whoop of victory ginny swooped past hitting a black ball away from hermione and she winked as she flew the other direction heading for seamus it was so exciting that hermione was lost in her adrenal rush and she felt nearly invincible nearly she reminded herself speeding past a female slytherin hermione flew towards the other end everything was happening so fast that she barely had any time to react when a shock of silver and green darted right in front of her it was draco she realized and anger flooded through her until she saw him mouth sorry now hermione saw what had held his attention a small golden ball that she assumed to be the golden snitch was fluttering right below him watch out hermione she heard shouted and she pushed forward allowing harry to catch up to draco whom she realized was not on his new broom but on the same broom he had been using since second year this was a fair fight then hermione kept her eyes peeled for bludgers but most of her attention as well as everyone else s was focused on draco and harry they were about ready to collide when suddenly draco flew upwards a victorious look on his face hermione was about to resign herself to half elation half disappointment when she realized that the golden ball had gotten away and that the only reason draco was smiling was because it had what are you doing shouted ginny game being played down here hermione slytherin just scored twice while your head was in the clouds the girl yelled and hermione dashed forward seamus who had gotten the ball through a foul threw it to her and hermione turned effortlessly around and flew in the other direction as she moved forward she realized that the faster she went the harder it was to dodge slytherins who were trying to bar her way i open shouted the other chaser hermione didntrecognize and hermione pitched the quaffle to him he made almost a full circle around the goal and served the ball as hard as he could towards the slytherin keeper head she ducked and a loud cheer shook the whole left side of the pitch as the quaffle flew right through the first goal hoop and seamus jumped forward kicking it through the one right next to it there were twenty points right there lowering herself hermione followed the slytherin chaser who now had the quaffle she was right on his tail when he suddenly swerved upwards through a tight space between his slytherin buddies which conveniently closed right as she tried to follow unlucky for hermione that one of his buddies was a beater she tried to block the first hit but the second was too much the bat made contact with the side of her head and she immediately felt her senses slow foul foul that was a foul yelled the person over the intercom and hermione heard vague boos as she tried to steady herself she had begun to slip forward on her broom and with a start she realized that at this point she was easy bludger bate shaking her injured head she tried to clear her blurry vision a whistle was blown somewhere below and she let out a sigh of relief when they all touched down you all right hermione asked harry as all they ran forward the slytherins had touched down too and hermione felt her head clearing the dizziness fading into fresh anger yeah hermione uttered rubbing her head please tell me that was a foul hermione stated in a low growl should be what he doing is he mad ron asked and the gryffindor team turned draco malfoy was shouting at his team in hoarse tones that they could all hear even across the field that was the most pathetic display of cheating i have ever seen if i wanted underhanded cheating violent utterly useless players i would have asked some of the hufflepuffs to come try out he shouted loudly and there were boos from the yellow section above granted i dontwant you hugging the damn gryffindorks but if we are going to win we are going to win on talent not on malicious crooked trickery if i see one more instance of dishonest unsportsmanlike misconduct i will pull you off your broom by the neck so fast you ll be seeing madam pomfrey so that she can stitch your head back on draco took to the air in a swift movement and hermione smiled if that isntthe oddest thing i think i ve ever seen ron murmured and hermione had to concur now that you re all right are you ready to get back up there harry asked and hermione nodded is that going to be a foul hermione asked and harry nodded he had just returned from speaking to the referee she said you get two free shots make them count it just you and the keeper and i guarantee that despite the fact this is your first game you ll do just fine harry assured her and hermione mounted her broom as she kicked off the referee threw the quaffle up to her and she caught it easily darting to the slytherin goal posts go hermione she heard shouted from below and she readied herself mentally as well as physically positioning herself in front of the center goal hermione observed how the keeper flew out ready to guard all three goals simultaneously on three hermione told herself three two one she feinted to her right and the moment she saw the keeper follow the movement she swerved back to the left and launched the ball through the air the keeper though caught on quick enough to block and catch the quaffle tossing it arrogantly back to hermione whose heart had sunk a foot at least all right then plan b hermione lunged forward throwing the ball into the air the keeper eyes focused on the quaffle didntsee as hermione flew to the right and hit the ball with the side of her right foot which sent the ball through the middle hoop in a blur of red hermione had noticed it had been neglected and had taken the opportunity that was handed her throwing her hands up in glee hermione shouted to all who bothered to hear that she had made her first goal uh hermione it excellent really and we ll celebrate later but the game happening right now the slytherins have the quaffle seamus said and hermione nodded following him to the other side of the field the slytherin chaser hit the quaffle past the other chaser and ron who hadntbeen prepared was unseated as the ball hit him in the stomach hermione groaned diving towards the bright red ball that was plummeting to the earth taking it in her hands she tossed it up to seamus who then passed it to the other chaser across the field but before he made it to the goal a loud cheering rose and before hermione knew what was happening the game was over gryffindors had won three hundred and twenty to two hundred and seventy they all landed and were immediately all over harry they may not have wrested the house championship from the ravenclaws but they had beaten the slytherins and hermione was all for the cheering she received as a member of the team yeah hermione shouted as she was pushed into a hug with ron and they all began jumping up and down suddenly harry was on their shoulders and they were carrying him up towards the castle where celebrations would no doubt start and commence until the early hours of the morning but hermione fell back guiltily looking back at draco their eyes met and she motioned inconspicuously for him to follow her she quickly made her way to the gryffindor quidditch shed and unlocked it once inside she neatly folded her uniform and placed it on a shelf then she set her broom in the corner and waited when draco entered the gryffindor quidditch shed hermione was beaming flushed with the excitement of her first quidditch game draco thought hermione looked more beautiful than she had ever looked before i scored one she said and draco didntwant to bring down her mood by telling her how disappointed in his team he was congratulations on wining your first quidditch game but we ll be training ten times harder and next year it ll be no picnic beating us draco said hermione smile didntfade in the least as she said i know and wrapped her arms around his neck i cantbelieve we won she breathed against his shoulder and draco writhed away what is it she asked and he blushed are you ticklish hermione asked and draco shook his head vehemently dontbe ridiculous honestly hermione he said but he was smiling he was sure as much as she was even if i was i wouldnttell you that he said raising his eyebrows in mock arrogance i sure you would she replied with a laugh sitting down on the floor of the shed she motioned for him to join her draco complied taking off his green and silver robes revealing his casual clothing beneath you own jeans hermione gasped and draco rolled his eyes you know how to play chess hermione asked and draco once again rolled his eyes who doesn t ron only knows how to play wizard chess hermione explained and draco looked confused there more than one kind he asked and hermione sighed yes there is the kind i good at is well muggle chess the pieces dontattack one another and you have to move them yourself but it really just as fun hermione said and he nodded are we going to play because i would be slightly frightened if you carry around a little chessboard and its pieces in your pocket draco asked and hermione gave a false laugh i planned ahead i ve barely gotten to see you this past week and i figured we could do with a game or two so i brought my board out here last night and hid it over here she stood and danced across the room pulling a sleek box from underneath some dusty old and frayed maroon and gold uniforms see she said while handing it to him this was my father until i started going to hogwarts he gave them to me as a bit of a good luck thing and they re the only ones i ll play with no one but harry and ron has seen it hermione said i feel privileged draco said seriously as he handed it back to her hermione opened the box and began setting up the pieces on the board so same rules except we have to do it all manually and no mangling eachother pieces he asked and hermione nodded i warn you hermione said i am better at this than one might assume watching me play with ron and harry she said and draco laughed right we ll see i guess hermione nodded and made the first move one hour and three games later hermione won yet again so you re not so bad draco stated sullenly i have to give you points you know your pieces well that i afraid has nothing to do with muggle chess hermione said in her know it all voice that made him want to clamp his hand over her mouth and not pull it away until she stopped breathing it all about logic you could open a brand new pack and win every time it all up here check mate she said and draco growled pushing the board away can we be done with this he snapped and hermione looked down at the board i sorry if i said something or did something i know i take things too seriously but i canthelp it she said slowly as she straightened the board and began gathering pieces and draco sighed it not that he admitted i hate losing and i can be a real git about it he said as he helped her carefully put her marble pieces back in their separate slots hermione paused as they reached for the same piece and their hands touched draco however grabbed her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze and his eyes drew hers leaning forward as he brushed a strand of hair out of her face draco prepared for their lips to meet but hermione pulled away standing what are we doing draco hermione asked suddenly and draco rubbed his forehead in frustration he knew that this question had been coming but he had expected more than two snogging sessions before it did i dontknow what you mean hermione draco stated flatly and hermione grabbed her board and walked across the shed to put it away i mean what are we doing i want to know what exactly is going on she said and draco picked imaginary lint from his pant leg of course you do he muttered softly is it bad of me to wonder where this is going i dontwant to get hurt neither do i draco said and i dontwant to hurt you but why does everything have to be planned out why cantthings just go the way they re going he asked and hermione placed her hands on her hips looking down at him you mean snogging without taking any responsibility or making any commitment whatsoever it must be nice to be draco hermione spat i canteven look at you he laughed and hermione despite herself cracked a grin as well what she asked you re so serious when everything about this is so silly he said immediately wishing he had chosen a better word oh is it hermione asked you intellects are so bent on logically planning every event in your lives you d prefer not living it first hand he said well we intellects never end up halfway through an idea when it too late to turn around and decide gee this was a bad idea i wish i would have planned this better hermione lectured sometimes learning is half the fun he said and hermione opened closed reopened and once again closed her mouth got you he said and hermione took her seat next to him i just want to enjoy this he whispered i dontwant to beat a dead horse so let me get this straight she said we re more than friends but little less than enemies hermione sighed that just about covers it draco said with a frustrated shrug i wish that there was more that i could offer but there isn t hermione smiled wryly a month ago this conversation would have been out of my realm of possibility hermione said with frown i just worried this doesntmake any sense hermione said slowly and draco shrugged there nothing you can do about it it not going to make sense i guess that why gryffindors and slytherins dontmake good snogging partners he said with a smile and hermione met his pale gray eyes with her brown ones they both decided to accept how things were gracefully where did you get that little tidbit of mundane information hermione asked playfully and draco shrugged a reliable source i suppose prove my source wrong and we ll see if they re reliable hermione joined the party an hour and a half after the game ended and no one seemed to notice as she entered late welcome said ginny harry and ron left to get some zonko sweets and visit fred and george i so glad they moved their shop to hogsmeade ginny said and hermione could tell by the strain in ginny voice that that wasntall she wanted to say to hermione you want to talk somewhere hermione asked and ginny nodded stiffly setting her drink down girl dormitory okay with you no there always someone down there whether you can see them or not ginny replied how about a walk around the grounds ginny suggested and hermione hastily agreed not only did she feel guilty for leaving ginny out in the cold about everything that was going on but worst of all she had just come from being with draco in a sudden surge of irrationality hermione wondered if ginny could smell the slytherin on her breath so hermione began but ginny stopped her they were now in the corridor below the charms classroom and ginny motioned for hermione to keep things down first off i want you to hear what i am saying ginny said her voice slowly rising you re insane he the ringleader of those slytherin morons and i dontdoubt in the slightest that he a part of his father group of voldemort cronies it crazy hermione and you you of all people should see that you donteven know i dontwant to know him and neither should you ginny said flatly you saw what he did to my father ginny voice trailed off as she choked on her words what they did to your father what lucius did to your father it wasnthim ginny hermione said you know that it wasnthim it was lucius and lucius is long dead no he lives on in that that bastard of a son i dontfeel better now that lucius is gone draco is just an extension of his father they re from the same filthy stock ginny began and hermione eyes flew wide open and look at him he proof that blood doesntmake the man wow hermione whispered boy was she in trouble yeah transition chapter chapter 31 the dark prophesy ron and harry sullenly made their way up to the divination classroom all ron could do to keep them sane was recite that this was the last class before holiday and then they would all be free for two weeks harry ron and ginny were going to the burrow over spring break and arthur who had just fully recovered from his summer injuries had something planned for them ron had invited hermione but she had refused saying that she had important work to do at hogwarts have fun in arithmancy hermione ron called as they parted ways arentyou going to wish us luck with divination luck is all i can wish you she said that about all her class if worth anyway ron gave her a look and she shrugged you two are the ones that insisted upon taking the useless class for what the third year in a row hermione lectured as she turned the corner a lot of help she is ron said as he moved his bag strap to the other shoulder i swear that arrogant look she gets on her face makes me want to strangle something sometimes he muttered and harry grunted in agreement there could be worse classes though i suppose like arithmancy or ancient runes harry said and ron laughed i ve got nothing to complain about then ron replied as he pulled the small stair down and they crawled up into the turret nice to see you mr potter said the dreamy voice of trelawney as they took their seats well this week child you look a bit peaky could be leprosy or worse cancer she nodded at her own assumption and quiet giggles traveled around the room even harry joined in the laughter this time been around any werewolves as of late she asked and harry smile faded not more than the average wizard i suppose harry said slowly good werewolves are a little less than fond of you she said and ron gave him a look of hidden meaning i assuming she took your look of fear seriously ron said and harry shrugged if only she knew about remus harry smirked that d knock that arrogant look off her face in an instant eh hey what do you reckon hermione has to do that she canttake a day off to come with us ron asked and harry shrugged with newt coming up who knows harry asked maybe she has some color coding to do she might even be working on that arithmancy project she told me the other day that they were almost done by they you mean her and malfoy ron asked and harry nodded watching ron ears turn red you cantcontrol who she i dontknow what they re doing and i not very sure i want to but whatever they are doing you cantdecided whether or not it happens harry explained while opening his textbook to the page trelawney had just assigned the fact remains that she has to make her own mistakes well what if we were to give her a little help un making the mistake she bent on making ron asked and harry sighed but he couldntdeny he was interested you ve already got a plan i suppose harry stated and ron shrugged i not going to share unless i know you re in on it he said slowly and harry laughed lowly when have i ever passed up an opportunity to play the hero ron harry asked and ron shrugged my point exactly now spill all right then i figure and by the end of the divination period harry was waist deep in one of the most intervening plot he had ever agreed to take part in it was so underhanded that it made harry cringe inwardly but it was too late to back out ron reminded him i really dontthink we should get involved i mean does hermione say anything to you about amber amber a ravenclaw harry said and ron clenched his fist there is a big difference harry ron hissed first off amber is a ravenclaw not a sleazy slytherin second she has a lot going for her very recently and third off she not a death eater no wait let me take that one a step further she has never seen conversed nor ever supported a dark lord this side conversation really has to stop you two or i ll see you both in detention trelawney said now tell me boys what you see when you look into your goblets harry looked down into his goblet seeing the same sick gray colored liquid he had been staring at for the past fifteen minutes stirring it up a bit he said the first thing he could think of i see a a snake harry said quickly and trelawney stepped forward softly cooing oh yes yes i see ron stifled a laugh behind his own goblet and trelawney threw a glare at his book that could have killed him a snake very interesting that could mean but before she could finish her prediction for harry untimely and very tragic death the bell rang and everyone stood put your goblets away harry walked towards the door to leave bag over his shoulder when suddenly trelawney had him in a hawk like grip hands off ron said while throwing her hands from harry shoulders but trelawney was no longer there with them her eyes were glazed over and a deep rasping was admitting from her throat rude sounds ensued the child will be taken and a most unlikely trio will arise from the ashes of their loss she rasped rising above their fathers they will take mantles all too large for their boy shoulders a slytherin will rise above all else and take the place the dark lord has occupied her voice cut off and she fell forward harry grabbed her under the arms and attempted to support her what the bloody hell was that ron asked genuinely puzzled now that you ve seen it you tell me it not creepy harry said leading her over to one of her chairs she just made a real prediction it was like the time in third year you remember what i told you what did it mean draco going to follow in his father footsteps after all harry uttered i with you in this plan you ve created i cantlet hermione get drawn into this sort of thing all right ron said and harry noticed how pale ron had become i just hope it not too late and they left trelawney to her mumbling as they flew down the corridors in the mad rush to get up to the gryffindor dormitories to pack for the trip to the burrow i frustrated hermione shouted at the top of her lungs and draco nodded slowly taking her wand out of her hand so am i now just take a breath and try again he shouted you ve got to mean it but i don t draco she said stomping her foot i cantsay it and mean it especially when in a week or two i going to be saying it at you it okay hermione draco said i ll have the counter curse what if it doesntwork what then i kill you and go to azkaban for the rest of my life and live with the guilt of killing you every day of it that what she said you saw the effect of the spell as well as i did it ll work he soothed but hermione shook her head taking the scrunchie out of her hair she tightened and replaced it i sure you ve used the spell before draco why dont you do it hermione asked suddenly her voice taking on a bitter and cruel tone that she knew was unnecessary you re right draco began i do have more practice but i also know the counter curse better than you too he said his voice going quiet it has to work this way and you know it i know i know she whispered it much harder than bellatrix lestrange made it seem when have you met bellatrix draco asked and hermione paused she hadnttold draco what happened the year before but then again how did he know bellatrix i got to see her in action last year when she escaped from azkaban and tried to kill us all draco looked puzzled bellatrix tried to kill you how is that possible we went to the department of mysteries last year and voldemort was there it turned out a whole bunch of death eaters were there as well and they tried to kill us but bellatrix only got she only got someone very close to us all her voice faded in sadness curses could do evil things and she was learning the worst of them all so it true draco whispered handing hermione her wand sirius black was still alive my third cousin or something near to that actually escaped azkaban hermione throat constricted you re related she asked that means yes bellatrix is my i donteven know the lines get so tangled sometimes it hard to find even your sister draco said it so odd to think hermione said that all of the great wizarding families of the world are somehow related i would have never guessed had i not seen your sister in the book i was reading the other day diana i think her name was correct me if i wrong you re wrong about the entire thing you see draco began i donthave a sister i am an only child that doesntmake any sense draco the book said i dontcare what the fucking book said hermione i dont have a sister and that is that he shouted now do it again remember wave like this no you re arm is moving way too fast yes now just round out the curve and flick good we may be able to try this soon he said and hermione shivered that is just the opposite of what she wanted to hear i dontwant to do this draco she said and draco growled aloud throwing himself into an armchair off to the side do you see where we are hermione draco asked and hermione nodded salazar slytherin told no one of this room this is where i found your gryffindor friend a member of hogwarts staff one of my housemates and who knows whom else this isntthird year magic hermione he explained harshly this is the real thing people are dying and more people are going to if we dontfinish what we started it is up to you and it is up to me can you deal with the guilt of others dying when we could prevent it with such a simple thing as a spell hermione shook her head looking around the walls were covered with darkly grotesque paintings of war and torture a fitting study for salazar you can do it and i am trying help you he said while standing hermione burst into tears dropping her wand on the ground draco paused while taking in the scene before him he didntknow why she was crying but that didntmatter it wouldnthave mattered had he meant to cause her this pain and as he stepped forward and enfolded her into his arms she slowly stopped crying and merely stood there i sorry it has to be this way and when it all over i promise you will never have to say those words to anyone again he whispered while running his fingers through her light brown hair why why what why would you make that promise hermione asked because i lo because i dontlike this any more than you do and i think that i would say anything at this point to make you stop crying draco said i hate it when girls cry my mother used to cry all of the time when i was younger and i just dontlike it you sounded like a gryffindor just then hermione said quietly and draco chuckled okay i dontlike it when girls cry but i like to make them cry draco corrected himself you seem to be good at it hermione replied we re going to be okay arentwe yes he said while looking down at her i hate it when you do that hermione said suddenly turning away do what act so sure of yourself i ask you the most difficult question i ve ever asked myself and you answer it just like that she said snapping her fingers for affect you act so sure i am sure he said i may cheat i may lie and i may not be the most honorable guy in all of hogwarts but you can trust me when i say that when there it is time to be sure of myself i know it what do you think ron and harry are doing she asked changing the subject as she always did when she sensed the conversation reaching a very intimate level i dontcare he whispered and for the millionth time in the past few months hermione felt her knees go weak it was beginning to become her natural reaction to draco flirtatious advances she realized we should probably finish working she breathed losing herself in his eyes and draco nodded all right but you owe me a n major fluff i know i almost gagged as i wrote it but believe me it not going to be like this for very long talk about foreshadowing eh i hope you guys enjoyed it the next few chapters should be pretty intense you know what happens when good things happen right i ll give you a hint look up the symbolic meaning of a yin yang well it balance balance is the symbolic meaning help me i need constructive critisism from someone another transition chapter but i think this is the best chappie i ve written in a while it base and to the point so here it is p s i kind of like it but then again i made it do authors always think their chapters are good whatever i wontremable too much here btw i would like to remember my cat today it has been two months since shepassed on today may11th thanx chapter 32 lucius pride draco flipped through each magazine each newspaper and each article page by page finding nothing significant he had asked hermione if he could borrow her book on famous families and the misprint was bothering him more than he would let on after the fifth hour looking through the library archives he was about to give up when he came across a familiar name narcissa malfoy his mother it was their his father and mother s wedding article in witch weekly looking at the photo draco wondered what had happened to his parents his mother now a pale middle aged beauty had once been a vibrant full bright young woman a slytherin the article said with a heart big enough to accept even the smallest hufflepuff and his father lucius malfoy he realized had once been a youth not too unlike himself granted his father hair was the same length he had kept it his entire life but other than a few other details draco could have sworn it was him he was looking at he had the same light frame piercing grayish blue eyes and a sneer at the ready draco lightly touched the picture of his mother who was now waving to someone in the crowd and sighed but upon closer inspection of his mother picture he saw a suggestive bulge right below where her hands rested contritely as she smiled looking closer draco watched her moving self with the utmost care she was pregnant draco uttered pregnant with a pang of fear he automatically began counting months and checking dates no they were married when i was born but then diana draco looked at the date at the top of the article twenty one years ago to the month draco read over it looked at his mother abdomen and recalculated all of the dates but he was unable to absorb the information he was gaining all right then so we re looking for about three or four months after this now he was looking through the newspapers searching for birth alerts in the wizarding town that his parents said they had bought their first house that is if they didntlie again he thought bitterly here it is diana elaine malfoy born on august 22 draco paused she was real diana had been only a legend to him an old malfoy story used to scare him into obedience into gross submission turning through the papers he moved thirteen years after her birth and sure enough he found an article marking her as a runaway a missing teenager of a dark aristocratic family that had all but fallen from grace since voldemort had fallen she was only thirteen when she went missing left i was six years old then that when they had moved this revelation shook the ground beneath his feet and he began to remember things that before now had been only whispers beyond a veil just images hidden behind a shroud of uncertainty a blond girl entered his mind and draco remembered things happiness when there was little to be happy about and fun when he had been allowed to do no more than sit at his desk studying latin as a young child standing draco slammed hermione book shut and knocked all of the articles he had been looking at off of the desk with a rough sweep of his hand pansy had known everyone knew but him all of the sudden draco felt embarrassment sink into his stomach he had played the fool though he was much less than na ve he had fallen for his father basic trick a trick draco had often used to gain loyalty playing on trust was a nasty malfoy trick probably what had lured narcissa into marrying a death eater rubbing his eyes draco let out a strangled groan lucius had once said to draco that he was his pride that he had sacrificed something so dear to his mother for him that she hated them both for it draco knew now what his father said was true narcissa did hate them both but now that lucius was dead there was only one of them left for her to hate grabbing his parchment with all his mathematics and collected information draco walked out of the library which he now had twenty four hour access to and made haste to dumbledore office upon reaching the gargoyle draco found himself stuck it was almost one o clock in the morning the password had been changed and it was rather dark in this hallway suddenly there was a shuffling behind him and draco turned pointing his wand straight in front of him lumos he said and his wand came alight there before him stood alias dark what on earth are you doing wandering about at this time of night mr malfoy she asked her tongue slithering over the words in obvious elation it had been a while since she had been able to take points from him and she was just brimming with joy at the prospects this situation presented her i need to see dumbledore draco said and alias shook her head waving her index finger towards him our dear headmaster is probably asleep beside that he has more important things to do than listen to you i am sure she snarled i am afraid that is where you are quite wrong in fact i was just sending another student off to bed when i heard you speaking said the soft wheezing voice of the headmaster draco sighed in relief something he had never thought he would do mr potter was sleep walking again i dontbelieve he was here to see you headmaster i was merely doing my duty as a member of the staff here an i thank you miss dark but i can handle this one on my own dumbledore interrupted and draco enjoyed the look on the dada teacher face as she puffed up defensively i never implied that you couldn t of course i ll be heading to bed then she muttered grumpily and draco smirked that would be a good idea alias and draco watched as the teacher faded into the shadows cursing in a foreign language that draco did not recognize you wanted to see me come in come in and draco was led once again into dumbledore office where he was about ready to explode tears dontmake men weak desire and ambition do chapter 33 draco displeased draco tossed the papers down on dumbledore desk and the old man began rummaging through them a perplexed look on his aged face and these are supposed to mean the man asked and draco sighed angrily and swept them back into his arms i have a sister had a sister draco said stumbling over the use of the preterit you knew about it i know you did because everyone did my father knew i wouldntlook through a history book trying to dig up roots because he made me think i knew my roots better than anyone else dumbledore nodded calmly i am very displeased why was this information not ever shared with me he asked banging his fist on the desk it was not my place to tell you mr malfoy now i suggest you calm down and have a seat before i hand you back over to miss dark the old man warned and draco took a seat letting out a huff of air as his back hit the cushion i actually quite curious to discover why she seemed so eager to punish you it of little consequence she holds a mad grudge draco explained and dumbledore nodded i dontunderstand he exclaimed what is it you dontunderstand dumbledore asked and draco shrugged helplessly where she went i dontknow where she went draco said my mother used to talk about her all the time and now that i think about it i think it may have been her way of getting back at my father but what did he mean when he said he sacrificed her exactly how it sounds draco your father did a great many evil things to secure your ascent in life and diana was one of them he said pausing he interlaced his fingertips and stared at draco very severely there is something you must know and the only reason i am telling you is because one i think you are old enough to know the truth and second because i think you deserve to know the truth draco nodded for dumbledore to continue your mother narcissa was a wonderful woman and great student throughout all her years at hogwarts she was even friends with james and lily potter but when she decided to marry lucius things changed dumbledore said when murmurs began passing through the halls of the school that something evil was rising everyone took a side he explained quietly lowering his voice with each word so that draco had to lean forward to hear there was a club here at this school i am ashamed to say that began it all begun by salazar slytherin daughter sirenia centuries before an exclusive slytherin group was made severus your head of house was involved in this club and we found out later from him that this was where voldemort got nearly all his young supporters including himself the members of this club called themselves the eaters of death which at one point meant the invincible but eventually evolved into what we know today as the death eaters your mother and you father were in this club and during her last year at hogwarts the year lucius and she got married everything about them both changed draco waited for some indication from the old man that what he said was some sort of joke but dumbledore did not even blink while he looked at the teenage boy she was pregnant when she graduated from hogwarts your mother and i am afraid she took on the title of wife all too soon they were married right before graduation and that summer was about the time that everything really took off for voldemort he explained but after voldemort was defeated your father had the notion that you his sole heir would be challenged or would lose your status to your sister so she disappeared they say she ran away but we all knew everyone knew how he felt about his girl child that was all too much like her mother that was when your mother really changed so my father killed my sister my mother was a death eater and everything i ever believed to be true is a lie draco asked and dumbledore surveyed him carefully above his half moon spectacles you look sick maybe i should take you to poppy dumbledore suggested and draco stood numb perhaps this was too much information for one night no i fine considering draco gathered all the papers in his arms closer to his chest and let out a deep breath i doomed that bastard planned everything out to the last detail and there no escaping you re sure that you re fine the old man asked holding his hand out across the table for draco to shake draco felt the soft warm flesh of dumbledore hand and for the first time since he had come to hogwarts he respected this man and he nodded straightening draco walked out of dumbledore office and made his way to the prefect dormitories holiday would be over in a few days and everything would go back to normal he supposed slowing as he reached the entrance to the commons draco felt anxiety build up inside of him if he entered that room and hermione was there waiting what would he say to her he would probably tell her the truth but but he doubted he would be very kind about it he whispered the password and was admitted into the room alight only by the warm glow of the house elf kept fire as he moved further in he felt the tension in his stomach fade only to be replaced by a new emotion that he was quite used to now disappointment he had inwardly hoped she would be here even draco knew when he desperately needed to talk but didntsee hermione plopping down in the red and gold chair next to the fire he sighed leaned forward elbows on his knees and rubbed his forehead he leaned slowly back and let out a groan as he couldntfight the torrent of emotions there were so many that the only three emotions he could easily discern were anger great sadness and an even greater helplessness his body ached with unreleased tears which he didntknow he still had and draco felt the unfamiliar burning behind his closed lids but he wouldntallow even one tear to trace its way from his eye down his cheek because it would inevitably be followed by another then another then another until he dissolved into the sobbing heap of uselessness his father had made him believe he was he felt the emotions pass and in their wake he was left utterly exhausted now he was just plain tired absorbed in his own thoughts draco didnthear the door squeak open nor did he hear the small footsteps as a small sixth year gryffindor crept from her dormitory to right behind his chair only when she leaned forward and wrapped her arms around his shoulders did he sense the presence of another person in the room what the matter where have you been hermione whispered in his ear and draco leaned his temple against hers i waited up for you it almost one thirty draco are you about to cry draco pulled away when she said this and turned his expression onto the fire where he glared maliciously at the simmering embers in the hearth draco hermione walked in front of the chair and draco could have laughed at her appearance she looked a lot like what draco mind imagined a muggle housewife would her hair was pulled back but it was obvious she had put no effort into smoothing it down or straightening it before she had she looked tired like she had been worrying she was in her pink night robe but the thing that struck him the most was what the expression on her face said to him something he had never seen between his mother and father her expression said good evening honey how was your day tell me all about it his parents had always been too busy to bother wondering what the other did during the day i was just in the library looking at that book of yours and i i decided to research my family he said slowly and hermione sighed and did you find something of interest to you she asked though he could tell she knew what his answer would be draco took a deep breath and in an instant an anger so deep that it made his blood boil flared within him he may not have been mad at her but that didntchange the fact that he was mad mad that he had been lied to mad that he felt like a na ve moron but he was even madder that she cared at all taking one look at her he stood so quickly that in reacting she fell backwards on her tailbone with a squeak of surprise not only did i discover that i had a sister that is most likely dead by my own father hands but my torture goes a whole step further when dumbledore tells me that my mother and father were both part of a secret society of slytherins that solicited the word of voldemort and recruited most if not all of his current followers draco shouted as he walked to the hearth very interesting eh you were right you were right once again hermione he snarled i wish i would have been wrong she uttered as she got up off of the floor and straightened her night robe by the way your nostrils are flaring and the look on your face i presume you must need to talk about it hermione inferred and draco smirked giving a small wry chuckle i ve been walking in the tracks my father laid out for me over the course of my whole life draco spat bitterly i thought i had changed something big but i haven t i am only avoiding the inevitable and i think you knew that i think everyone knew that draco looked down at his fingertips which were fidgeting nervously atop the mantle i thought that hermione stated but then i saw that you re not a slytherin at all draco you re a human just as i am human not a gryffindor she paused stepping forward and to reply to your other statement i would just like to say that you have changed something big you ve changed something so big in fact that few ever get the opportunity to change it hermione looked down at her feet as she spoke now and draco had to force himself to look away take your father for instance i donthonestly believe that anyone let alone lucius wants to end up the way he was the way he was when he died but through everything that happened he was never offered a chance nor the tools to change himself i dontunderstand you know all the dogmatic beliefs you had when you came to hogwarts she asked and draco nodded not sure if he liked the direction this conversation was going well have they changed of course they have or i would never had we never would have kissed or or talked for all that matter draco said that my point no no no you dontsee my point hermione you re not getting it she cringed as he took an angry step towards her and flinched when he threw his hands up in the air those are things that we think are changed but the truth is that when i go home this summer i will revert to the same evil behaviors i have been tied to my whole life do you understand that you see that they are evil though before they were normal you accept the fact that what you were doing and what you were being taught was wrong hermione said but they re not he murmured they re not wrong just different what your father did to arthur weasley was wrong draco i am sure you see that as clearly as i do hermione said slowly trying to control her emotions to get her point across what about what he did what he still does to me is that wrong or is that parenting he asked it wrong she assured him calmly it wrong and you re still suffering from lucius mistakes you need to stop blaming and let go of lucius and take responsibility for draco hermione stated as she stepped forward opening her arms to him what would you know about anything mudblood he snarled and the word rolled floridly off his tongue leaving a wound deeper than any knife could have at this point in time her arms fell beside her you know nothing of the convoluted plans and paths my father created or any father creates for his son i am being groomed for more than this he said motioning to the surrounding room i am being groomed for more than you you have to realize this hermione looked so hurt as tears filled her eyes that draco almost took it back fuck that he thought it her own fault for getting involved reaching up around her neck hermione grabbed something pulled it free from her neck and threw it on the ground where he heard precious stone and metal shatter i thought we had gotten past this entire stage draco but you are such a coward that you keep walking backwards hoping to catch a glimpse of a shortcut or easy way out that you ve missed hermione said i have lost so much time effort and raw emotion in you yes maybe even love and look it was for nothing because you wontlet go of a ghost she snapped my friends will never trust me again you know and it is entirely your fault hermione turned from draco and walked towards the gryffindor dorm but draco acting on impulse thought this was the last opportunity he would ever have to feel her close to him and he leapt forward pushing her into one of the side walls he immediately leaned forward and took her lips into a hard kiss she went still in shock but a split second later she pushed him away from her and slapped him so hard across the face that he could feel her hand print burning its mark across his pale face you might want to go cleanse yourself hermione hissed or better yet why not just burn your cloak since chances are it will never come clean again hermione turned away from him utterly disgusted and walked into her dorm slamming the door behind her hard enough to knock a porcelain figurine off of the mantle draco turned and walked back to the chair something crunched under his foot as he sat and he looked down inspecting the object it was the mood stone he had given to hermione picking it up draco looked at the bent frame in horrified guilt the stone was crushed the metal bent and the chain broken but it still held the little warmth hermione chest had offered it she wore it i had no idea she wore it and finally the tears came unrestrained and unpredictable the tears came he felt the urge to cause harm to himself but knew that little good would come of any self inflicted wound there was something wrong with a sixteen year old noble born slytherin boy crying curled up in the fetal position on a red and gold armchair draco decided and he threw himself onto the cold stone floor where he allowed himself to be consumed in all of the emotions a malfoy was never supposed to feel crying it like a window to your soul it like a loss of some control yet however weak it makes you feel it the only way to truly heal if i could cry for what i long it d be for innocence come and gone i d cry for the selfish way i act for the grace and courage which i lack i d cry for the sufferings of this earth cry for the pain i ve caused since birth i d cry for the understanding way i feel when i take what hurts and learn to deal i d cry for my hearts impatient demands and for my thoughts choked off by my own hands i d cry for the emptiness i feel inside for the chance to run but nowhere to hide i d cry for the way others have looked at me with their looks of disgust or their ugly pity i d cry for the nights when i ve lain awake questioning every move that i make i d cry for the boy who wants so much to be well and for the voice that screams he deserves this hell a n i give full credit of this wonderful poem to warped and twisted on fictionpress the words in brackets were altered because well let face it draco not a girl hey guyz long time no hear from eh i ve been so busy lately i just started driver ed and well that takes up most of my time i on break though so expect great things this chapter was kind of between a transition and an introduction to a new obstacle they must overcome have fun chapter 35 when a mudblood gets angry hermione sulked out of mcgonagall classroom at one forty seven on thursday morning utterly exhausted mcgonagall had thought of quite the fitting punishment for wednesday detention and hermione had to admit she wasntall that eager to yell at another professor for a good long time during the course of her almost five hour detention hermione had scrubbed the classroom spotless organized all of mcgonagall old papers and some new one s and created a lesson plan for the next year fifth year transfiguration students now you know what it is like to be a teacher mcgonagall had said we do a lot more than correct and nag miss granger teaching is an art and now that you have learned that art i doubt you will be abusing it hermione had nodded vehemently hoping to be let go early no such thing happened it almost two in the morning miss granger i have kept you a bit longer than i intended no harm done though hermione had sighed wiping her forehead with the back of her hand you may go i suggest you go straight to bed though you have only a limited amount of time to sleep before classes begin and newt are next week dontwant to get off schedule right before testing thank you professor as hermione walked down the darkened hallways she couldntshake the feeling that she was being followed she may not have heard anything and or seen anything strange but she could feel someone or something watching her following her every move with their eyes though she was exhausted she could not help but speed her pace as she turned through the maze of corridors eventually she lost all sense of direction and just began turning around random corners trying to throw of whatever was bent on scaring the living daylights out of her where am i she asked herself ten minutes later she was in a secret corridor all right and she was no longer being followed but now she was terribly lost it seemed as though she had chosen the darkest eeriest and emptiest hallway to get lost in right in front of her hung the creepy portrait of an aristocratic woman hermione had recognized immediately that it was a muggle piece of art for it did not move all right i took a right then a left then i walked through the durmstrang tapestry and i here she told herself we ve got this all i have to do is turn around make a left then make a right and then i m still lost suddenly the portrait in front of hermione disappeared and someone stepped through the doorway that had appeared out of nowhere hermione threw herself against the wall flattening her body as far back as she could come on now get out you useless creature hissed the voice over his shoulder and hermione heartbeat accelerated she recognized the voice but she couldntplace it to a face get moving we have to get this to dumbledore lupin hermione whispered as she stepped from the wall and the shuffling ahead of her stopped the wizard lit his wand and suddenly hermione was standing face to face with none other than remus j lupin their former defense against the dark arts teacher hermione what on earth are you doing about the castle at night he looked tired not at all unusual for him and hermione felt apprehensive i had detention and i got lost hermione replied honestly and lupin looked surprised hermione though had a question of her own that she wanted answered erm who were you talking to professor hermione asked oh this little bundle of burden he said pulling on a leash auru hermione exclaimed leaping forward to grab the creature lupin held captive how did you get out you know this little kelltor he asked how i must have been mistaken this isntauru my auru not purple there more than one at hogwarts hermione asked snape informed me that there was a pack running about in reclusive places lupin said while he yanked on the leash the kelltor growled and hermione leaned forward picking it up shhh she cooed and lupin let go of the leash a whole pack yeah and since i am the replacement groundskeeper and filch is sick snape so kindly insisted that i be the one to take care of it lupin said bitterly and hermione nearly dropped the kelltor in her arms you re the replacement groundskeeper lupin nodded that means you re the care of magical creatures professor then just while hagrid gone on his mission right hermione asked and lupin looked surprised that she knew as much as she did i should have assumed you knew i will be teaching care of magical creatures classes until hagrid returns yes he said what do you plan to do with all the kelltors you find hermione asked patting the purple one she held on the head and making odd noises in its face this one seemed to like her a lot more than her own did they ll probably be put down put down what hermione asked and the kelltor gave a little groan that made her heart ache yes put down or hagrid will take them and attempt to teach you all about how they re minds work he said holding his arms out for the small creature hermione handed the female kelltor over to lupin without hesitation and he smiled hagrid wontlet them be killed dontworry about it hermione hermione nodded though the look on her face was still one of apprehension hagrid will probably breed them though she said with a smile and lupin nodded trying to gain control of it so you kept one as a pet did you how did you train it lupin asked these creatures seem to have a mind all their own oh auru is far from trained hermione laughed he a selfish little pet but but it keeps my mind off of crookshanks what happened to crookshanks remus asked remembering how the cat had guarded sirius life from harry during the year he had taught at hogwarts oh he wandered into the forbidden forest they think he was killed by a by a werewolf lupin asked and hermione nodded that or a raccoon dontworry about saying it hermione he said slowly it not like the word itself can make me transform i know i just dontwant to offend you hermione replied and an uncomfortable silence fell between them you should probably head to bed then i wonthave you sleeping on hagrid paddock tomorrow lupin said with a wink besides i ll probably need you and your two friends at full strength to defend me when everyone realizes who back eh lupin said and hermione frowned i ll see you tomorrow she said turning oh professor hermione began and lupin paused yes hermione who was subbing before you she asked and he shrugged a professor kettleburn or something of the likes i sure i ll see you tomorrow hermione goodnight now hermione waved and turned down the corridor now that she had the sense to pull out her wand the hallways werentnearly as dark and she finally found herself in a place she definitely recognized the transfiguration hallway that hallways where she had met lupin had turned out not to be a shortcut at all once she finally made it to her room she threw herself onto her bed and fell to sleep almost immediately clothes and all hermione ate her lunch very slowly her eyes barely open and harry patted her on the back softly she jumped and knocked her juice all over her homework are you going to be all right for care of magical creatures harry asked and hermione scrambled to fix the papers she could salvage i ll be fine as long as i dontget another five hour detention she hissed i swear i think mcgonagall did it on purpose hermione accused she knows i cantfunction without the minimum of sleep required for our age group i think she was trying to teach you that yelling at teachers will not be accepted said ginny as she joined the table and stuffed a piece of bacon in her mouth and took a drink of her juice where have you been harry asked seeing to neville thank you very much ginny snapped i donthave to be in the same place at the same time every day do i please tell me if i need to set my schedule in stone and make it work around you hey now harry said what wrong with neville it looks like hermione was right but neville didntknow so he wandered around the castle all last night ginny said sadly he thought he didntremember where the detention was and he looked for candlelight all night until snape i know of all people caught him and gave him another detention she finished and took another drink i ve just now gotten him to calm down it turns out some ravenclaw found him huddled outside of mcgonagall classroom at four in the morning after snape had gotten through with him because he couldntremember the password to gryffindor tower wow hermione uttered poor neville i wonder why i didntsee him after i got out of detention with mcgonagall he ll probably be as tired as you if not more so ron said and who knows what kind of substitute we ll have substitute hermione exclaimed suddenly i ve just remembered she said smacking herself on the forehead lupin is our comc substitute until hagrid gets back i ran into him last night and he just come yesterday that small witch from fourth year was subbing until now lupin harry asked in disbelief are you sure hermione could sense the eagerness in harry voice and it made her throat close yeah i just talked to him last night harry smiled he hadntseen lupin since summer and well they had a lot to talk about hopefully this would help harry cope with his loss of sirius in a bit more of a healthy manner wow ginny said i cantwait until tomorrow then but how is everyone going to take him being a well you know ginny asked voicing everyone worries all at once it doesntmatter harry interrupted we ll take it as it comes i just glad someone from the order is at hogwarts besides dumbledore things have been happening and there little that dumbledore as headmaster can do about it yeah maybe he can knock some sense into hermione here dating draco malfoy ron agreed with a laugh and only a second after it had left his mouth did he have a rather large sausage stuffed up his nose and the next time you even come close to butting into my personal life you will soon find there are other more sensitive body cavities that would love to get their hands on a sausage just like that one hermione snarled viciously as she took a bite of her lightly buttered toast ohhh ginny mocked ronald in trouble now but seriously hermione he not all that wrong come on guys it not our place to tell hermione who she can and cannot date that a decision only she can make and if she wastes it on that git of a malfoy all we can do is be there for her to pick up the pieces harry said in an almost noble voice that reminded hermione of dumbledore right ron said his voice trailing off into nothing can you pass the eggs harry ginny asked but hermione mind could not switch gears you all make it seem like i in love with the fellow she said standing i not i can assure that but that doesntchange the fact that it is absolutely none of your business she grabbed her books from the table shoved her papers into her bag and left heading down hagrid hut where the lessons would take place the werewolf spat draco as he reached the paddock and set his bag down next to him with a flourish ah lucius boy draco i believe your name was lupin questioned you can call me malfoy werewolf draco snarled his lip curling up in disgust where the old brute gotten himself eaten i d wager he sick was the curt reply i canteven believe they d let him on campus again i heard he almost killed two students in third year someone whispered and remus felt his confidence falter he wanted people to know but he wanted them to understand well class since you re all here i guess our lesson should begin he said almost pacing considering the slightly odd circumstances i figured our first lesson should be about me he said and there were whispers all around the paddock most of you have probably heard that i am a werewolf and more than one of you is uncomfortable with that knowledge a bit fidgety one could even say he said turning his attention to neville longbottom one of the students he remembered more clearly but i assure you that my lycanthropic transformations have nothing to do with me and i will show you how that is possible today if you will all please gather round harry ron and hermione all stepped closer whereas everyone else hesitated come on get over yourselves maybe you ll learn something ron shouted like how to live without an arm draco cut in i d rather not it not even close to full moon you git hermione said it a little too close for my comfort actually what the hell is his problem hermione asked herself oh yeah he a malfoy she uttered and ron looked at her questioningly thank you three oh you ve come to join us you five well this will be quite the lesson then an hour and some odd minutes later ron hermione and harry were about to leave the paddock when remus approached thank you three i see things haventchanged much since i went here myself he said wistfully harry i was wondering if you d like to meet with me later in the week i curious to know how you ve been faring and what you ve been up to sure harry replied immediately well you three i ll see you next week off to classes now and they all three watched as remus made a nervous habitual circle around the perimeter he was expected to teach on to inspect the condition of all the equipment harry yeah you guys can use my invisibility cloak he said and began walking up the hill he looked sad almost perturbed at the sight of the way lupin was acting so nervous and scared something was going on thanks ron replied and hermione nodded in tired agreement but she had other things on her mind like how many ways she could kill draco and get away with it he was completely out of line and she would make sure he knew it hermione waited in the prefect commons for almost three hours for draco to show up and when he finally did she immediately noticed he was inebriated that was how he handled things oh granger i see you ve been awaiting my arrival with much anticipation he slurred and hermione guffawed yes if only to tear you to pieces what the hell is your problem with lupin she asked and draco smirked donttell me you dontknow he a werewolf he said as if this explained everything he had said this afternoon i k now that you git h i canttalk to you when you re not sober she said and pointing her wand at him and uttering a few choice latin words draco suddenly stood upright and glared very seriously you just took away the only fun i ve had in weeks if that true you re more pathetic than i originally assumed hermione quipped glad that they would be having this conversation with him sober back to the judgmental stick in the mud hermione eh i glad i wasntaround for the big reformation he snarled me too you might have decided i was too disgusting to survive hermione said bitterly i never said you were disgusting he muttered and hermione crossed her arms over her chest but you say hagrid disgusting and mudbloods are disgusting i like hagrid i am of mixed descent as well she explained as if she was speaking to an infant yes well you re different i suppose and dontgo off asking me how i dontknow hagrid is he half giant how can you like the vile vicious things he asked and hermione smiled that not hagrid his mother was like that not him how i see it is she bit her lip thinking he just a bit too tall and his heart just a bit too big to accommodate every single person wishes you see no i see that he is a giant just like i see dumbledore as an old crack pot who teaches parlor tricks and i see you as as as what a passing attraction a game hermione shouted i done playing mind games with you draco now make up your mind you accept me my friends and everyone i know and trust or you dontaccept me at all i cant i just can t hermione and if you only knew if you knew you would understand he said no i wouldn t say the word and all this can just disappear draco just like you want everything can just go back to normal you hating me and me me hating you hermione choked on the words and hoped with all her being that he wouldntsay the words that would send her crashing back down to earth okay suppose i say this word draco weighed aloud i lose everything that is keeping me alive physically as well as mentally or i could ask you for a hug and a kiss and everything can be all better are those the choices you re giving me because they suck you can do whatever you want but there have to be rules and i think you know that you cantjust throw your little fits and expect me to be there when you realize you were way out of line you cantinsult everything i know and love and above all you cantsend yourself willingly down that path of self destruction you seem so bent on taking she said sighing i cantwatch you kill yourself just like i told harry the other day it hard to watch someone you think you know lose themselves to things other people get over and walk away from all right he said and hermione was taken aback all right that it she asked yes he looked down at his feet and she crossed her arms over her chest we should really look into you being bipolar hermione said quietly oh and have i mentioned lupin yet she asked suddenly remembering the disrespect he had shown their substitute and one of the best teachers she had ever known no but you might as well let me have it for that too draco said sullenly lupin is one of the best teachers we have ever had the luck to have at this school and to make mean and malicious comments about a small issue small issue you must be crazy hermione werewolves attack humans every day it doesntmatter whether their woman children infants or full grown men they kill whatever meat they can find he exclaimed as if she was stupid you re absolutely right that i shouldntfear my life when forced to be around one he said slapping his forehead lupin not like that lupin not like that hagrid not like that dumbledore not like that nobody really how they seem at all are they hermione he asked it frightens me that you find yourself comfortable in such company well maybe you need to be frightened maybe you should be just scared enough to actually get to know these people that you treat like dirt because of their heritage now that would be frightening she said loudly you re right it would be draco admitted knowing what his reply would cause you are so arrogant she shouted and turned walking into the gryffindor prefect dorm slamming her door behind her now that that over with draco uttered with a smirk even though she had said the last word he had won the argument and he knew that tomorrow it would be over or so he hoped a n yay lupin back is anyone else excited expect to see a lot of him if you re a lupin lover you wontbe disappointed hope you liked it yay i back in the game guys and i better than ever thanks to carrie anonymous terratasha draconmione and everyone who was kind enough to offer a solution to my seemingly sotry ending problem thank all so much it only with your help that i was able to continue with this chapter 35 a day or two of solitude over the next few days draco saw just how wrong he could be about hermione she said not one single word to him unless it was school or arithmancy related and she almost refused to look at him he had no idea how much her demeanor could change and now that he saw it well he didntlike being ignored before and now now he hated it so is it a banshee or woodork draco asked hermione who shrugged and pointed to his book right the old textbook he sighed looking forlornly down at the moldy pages of his herbology book it was of little matter that he was not in herbology at all but in potions have you been practicing the spell draco asked quietly and hermione gave him the dirtiest look he was sure she could muster dontyou say a word about that in here she hissed snape not exactly a stranger to overhearing conversations that are none of his business you know hermione spat snape cool draco said with a smirk he was on a roll for a second he wondered why on earth he was enjoying this so much but then he was suddenly reminded of the kind of slytherin he was the malfoy kind he used to eat little gryffindor firsties for breakfast and beat the hell out of the older ones for the accompanying entertainment it was no wonder that this little bit of torture held so much joy for him after all it had been a while since he had felt the urge to satisfy this less savory part of his personality and he doubted she would prefer for him to save it for the ickle firsties so are you going to answer or will i be left to wonder until you blast me to pieces he asked and hermione lips tightened in discomfort good she was still nervous about using the spell at least she didnt want to kill him you re getting some sick pleasure out of this arentyou she asked and draco thought about it for a moment then nodded all i want out of the whole deal is a few civil words here maybe a kiss there he said with a smile and hermione though she wasntexactly mad only glared letting the corners of her mouth twitch he was getting somewhere well if you arentthe same arrogant little ferret miss granger mr malfoy would you like to carry out the rest of your conversation in detention or hold your tongues until you are safely out of range of my ears snape sardonic voice was quiet but ever syllable left them shivering and draco leaned back carelessly and closed his herbology book i ll take this he said snappishly slamming it shut with one hand you can get it after newt s but i have to study draco protested loudly and snape shrugged as if the matter were beyond his control i am sure mr malfoy that you have more than one friend whom can loan you a book or at least stand to be in your company long enough to make sure you understand the mediocre art of herbology snape gave a quick tap on the desk and decided to add a last stinging comment if you re worried about herbology mr malfoy i would suggest that you not bother taking newt at all snape paused placing the book in his robes however potions should be your main focus considering the grading scale you all must remember that the grade you get on that test affects twenty percent of your overall potions grade longbottom pay attention you of all people writing and snape walked the other direction spouting off about irresponsibility incompetence and worst of all clumsiness draco almost felt sorry for the poor klutz almost draco walked into his dorm utterly exhausted but paused suddenly as soon as he entered there was a boy on his bed and it sure as hell wasntdraco he had dark wavy hair that would have fallen past his shoulders had it not been held in place by a small intricately designed band his eyes were dark and gave him one look before returning to the magazine he held loosely in his hands draco started towards him angrily who the hell do draco hermione exclaimed as she bustled into the room blankets and pillows in her hands she pointed her wand at an area in the corner and uttered something and a bed appeared after she enchanted the sheets to tidy themselves she turned back to face draco a competitive look on her face how the hell did you get in here he asked and hermione shrugged holding a pair of oddly shaped keys in her hands dumbledore gave me the keys she explained looking nervously to the moron in his bed you will be sharing a dorm with a visitor who it seems had a little problem with his time turner the hell i will be why canthe and weaselby share a bedroom he asked throwing his bag down because it seems that dumbledore thinks you and he have more compatible personalities as it turns out his house is the equivalent of the indian slytherin hermione explained indian draco asked and hermione nodded his school learns apparation fairly early and they all use time turners to get to their classes and when he used it and was stranded her figured he could apparate properly though he thought he knew what he was doing he was unpleasantly surprised by ending up here at hogwarts hermione said and draco was shocked at how calm she seemed almost excited his name is daniel wright i guess his mother was european and he a sixth year just like us he speaks limited english and please be nice draco suddenly draco realized why she went rambling off about his background she was hoping if he knew a bit about the kid he would like him he wontbe bunking with me let him sleep in your room and you and i can share this one draco suggested semiseriously and hermione frowned deepened into a glare that a no dumbledore knew you would be apprehensive apprehensive i flat out refuse so he offering either extra credit or money take your pick draco could tell by the tone of her voice that his choice mattered to her just as much as it mattered to dumbledore but for a very different reason dontyou try to bribe me what do you think i am a politician draco asked and hermione smiled a bit her face borderline between worry and hopefulness and draco felt the urge to deny the indian kid just to wipe that look of her face but the other part of draco the one that seemed to dominate him as of late would not allow it fine i ll take the freaking idiot now get out do you want to study herbology later hermione asked as she reached the door and draco was taken aback so good deeds didntgo unrewarded i ll store that little tidbit for later you bet what about you daniel hermione asked and the boy looked up from his odd magazine and smiled nodding hermione it settled out in the common room at eight tonight if daniel doesntshow up i ll assume it murder hermione added so only draco could hear and he growled under his breath you can be so i know draco i know life is so hard for the little rich boys sometimes she said and that comment shut him up you little bye then and hermione closed the door laughing to herself all the way to her room so you re name is daniel draco asked and the kid didnteven look at him do you have a nice family he asked and again there was no response do you understand english draco asked slower this time yes i do now can you shut up and let me read i donttalk to american wizards you disgust me draco almost laugh until he realized the little git was completely serious i insulted draco said placing a hand on his chest in feigned hurt i not american i was born and raised in western europe i a proud brit you sound american but when draco tried to reply the boy held up his hand to silence him an honest look of utter disgust on his face and for the first time in draco life he imagined he knew what it felt like to be a mudblood do you learn different spells in india hermione asked leaning over the table she was very interested in this foreign wizard and draco could tell the foreign wizard was very interested in her yes but mostly they uhh they do same things we learn to fly but not on brooms he paused i see you have very nice facilities slaughtering the word yes we english pride ourselves in doing the best we can so what kind of wand do you have hermione asked and daniel groped in his robe pockets here it is 13 uhh inches and two sanimeters right hermione nodded the wood is cedar imported from germany what is the core she asked and he smirked our cores in india are very meaningful many of the creatures we have in india are precious hermione suggested secret draco interrupted and daniel nodded throwing draco an unappreciated glare i see is it an animal hermione asked what dontyou understand hermione draco asked stop giving the poor kid the third degree he already told you he doesntwant to tell you i would be delighted to let you know ermine daniel said smoothly this is very private information that i only share with uhh those who are very special he paused it is also a ritual at our schools when we propose to our loved ones we exchange that uhh secret as a sort of vow what a charming ritual hermione said clapping her hands and draco mind was going crazy this kid was driving him crazy hermione was driving him crazy what a charming ritual the more hermione found out about daniel the more interested she became it turns out he wasntas far close in time as she was led to believe daniel was born in 1897 and when she asked him how he could be so calm about what the future looked like he answered my people have had the gift of time travel for many thousands of years you think this is the first time anyone has seen this i myself have been in this time twice and i ve gone further than you can imagine isntthat dangerous to see the future she asked i know what to expect and if that is dangerous then nothing is as safe as it seems okay so you are not american daniel admitted with a loud sigh and draco laughed triumphantly and shut his book entitled the malfoy heritage a compilation of facts about one of history most notorious pureblooded wizarding families you are still arrogant and obnoxious i dontsee how ermine puts up with your constant uh sarcasm first of all it her mi o ne draco said enunciating on every syllable second off i would have to say you re not exactly the easiest guy to get along with yourself what this thing you ve got against americans they may be stupid but what d they ever do to you they just they are uhh disgusting daniel said they pollute the world with their ideas of freedom and democracy and their offspring are let me guess disgusting daniel nodded i used to know an american draco said she was the exact opposite of what you just described but daniel would have none of it dontdefend them to me you are wasting your breath and now i can see that later that night as draco sat in the library reading over the final translation of the new spell he pondered over what daniel said and it truly bothered and frustrated him what kind of dogmatic beliefs that kid had how could something on so large a scale be so black and white pureblooded and impure blooded asked draco mind so that was what was bothering him subconsciously there is a big difference i mean werewolves not werewolves a werewolf his mind replied and the man himself has not been at all unkind to you he a vicious animal draco justified no he both man and beast but the only side you have seen is man and hermione has seen both and it should say something to you about the man if she is still defending him maybe you owe lupin a bit more respect than you have shown maybe lupin can be both man and beast and still be a good wizard fine you win and that all came from your own mind stop bragging he said to himself but inwardly he was thinking very important thoughts i think i owe someone an apology i sorry draco coughed and remus lupin was actually surprised no more like shocked for what he asked a lot more calm than he actually was i haventbeen very kind to you draco muttered and i realize and respect what kind of courage it must have taken you to show up at hogwarts for the third time and still be so even headed had that really come from a malfoy mouth it certainly reeked of slytherin mockery maybe even malfoy trickery then again lupin had been apprised of a certain odd situation at hogwarts from harry it turns out that miss granger has had quite the influence over mr malfoy over the past few months did hermione put you up to this he asked letting his paranoia reach a sickening point no she doesnteven know i here nor is it any of her business he made sure to add disgust in his voice and lupin smiled so the rumors were true then i thank you for this little visit and i hope you will be more teachable lupin said with a smile say is that time turner boy from india classing up with slytherins or gryffindors i heard from a very reliable source that you and this boy have taken quite well to one another hermione draco asked and lupin gave a shrug that answered his question yeah i think rooming with him is enough he eats like a pig snores like one and i swear if i didntmake him shower he would opt not to draco said and lupin chuckled he had never even used a tooth brush before i couldntstand it any longer and conjured one up for him draco sighed leaning comfortably against lupin desk i swear i dontknow how those bloody historical people survived without proper hygiene i mean honestly how they avoided diseases and extinction is beyond me the room went silent and suddenly the comfortable turned very tense i should be headed up to the library newts are near draco said and lupin nodded next week right draco groaned while nodding and lupin laughed have fun good luck and thank you mr malfoy i could do with another ally you could do with a thousand more i say draco said seriously and lupin nodded donti know it draco was the first one done in the hall and as he raised his hand and snape came from the staff table and picking up his paper he looked over it with a skeptical eye very good mr malfoy very good i glad you remembered that lesson it was short but i warned you yes and snape walked off in the other direction looking very pleased indeed if only he knew the trouble i went through to learn that potions book from front to back he sighed and lay his head down one more test and then newt would be over and they could all relax draco eyes wandered across the great hall and settled on whom he would bet was doing the best of the three gryffindor greats hermione was nervous he could tell by the was she was using her left foot to slip of her right shoe then push it back on by the way she was biting her lip and squinting her eyes as if the answers were inscribed on the paper and all she needed to do was look hard enough draco smiled he wondered what nervous habits he had many people had told him he picked at lint or bit on the end of his quill but he never realized he was doing it and so he never caught himself in the act suddenly he was struck by quite the odd question had hermione noticed any of these things if she had she had never mentioned it except for once forcing his eyes away for fear of burning a hole in the back of her head draco refocused his eyes upon the staff table though he admitted the people at that table were far less easy on the eyes than hermione he followed the table all the way to the end where he saw daniel sitting he was still reading that same magazine and when draco had brought it up to him he had replied i am learning more english from this than any other thing in this school can teach me so let me be and he d throw something hitting draco one out of four times usually an hour later the last test was collected and they were set free for the rest of the afternoon hey hermione he said catching up to her as a quick pace and hermione turned waving to daniel over his shoulder are we ready he asked are we draco nodded hey daniel want to see something magnificent before you go back to your india hermione asked a fond smile on her face daniel nodded and saw the look of adoration in the young indian eyes follow us to the forbidden forest hermione he cantcome draco exclaimed oh draco why not hermione asked and daniel seemed genuinely intrigued hey co pilot over there so we may convene privately draco spat and hermione nodded crossed her arms over her chest and followed first of all i dontthink you understand the seriousness of this thing we ve done we could not only be expelled for this but we could die we could get arrested draco paused calming down at seeing the look of fear and anger on hermione face and besides that he from a different time what if he took the spell back to then and set a whole domino effect in motion maybe voldemort wouldnthave risen to power harry and neville would have their parents and you wouldntbe so damn miserable hermione replied so you have put thought into this how do i explain this he asked his voice trailing off you cantjust change what you want to change hell maybe harry mother would have married someone else and harry wouldntexist maybe the weasley wouldnthave had a cause to fight for and so they stayed the raw hufflepuffs i ve seen them as and maybe you wouldnthave had a reason to talk to me at all you see is it worth it to lose all this that we have i mean it not grand but it all we have this is life that curse is the worst thing to happen to wizarding kind and you re arguing with me about ending the torture and death two centuries early hermione asked yes because you dontknow what will happen and for all we know someone will find a more horrific spell to use in place of it hermione nodded accepting defeat now are you ready or do you want to wait what good will it do to wait hermione looked over to daniel and draco practically read her mind we dontwant to be followed she nodded i know a spell hermione nodded again and five minutes later they were on the edge of the forbidden forest and positive daniel had no way of finding them all right now i going to coax you to make you angry and hateful towards me he paused if this goes badly i want you to do and say whatever you can to get out of trouble all right say it was self defense i was attacking you he asked and she nodded tears filling her eyes dontcry dontbe weak maybe it the mudblood in you or maybe it that harry potter was in you the little coward you know what screw this whole lying thing let take it to the next step make it real draco said and hermione pulled her wand from her pocket come on baby come and get it all right i ll come to you draco face took on an odd expression and hermione was shocked this seemed so real he looked ready to devour her i saw you in that skirt the other day and i think you re so fuckable that i could fuck you now and no one could hear you scream and we re alone and everything you would say i did it to you and i would say we did it together and considering that everyone thinks you re a slut who will they believe hermione began too tremble this was too real brought back too many memories it was utterly terrifying to see that feral hungry animal like look in his eyes and hermione found herself growing hot she felt her pulse pumping through her veins who was he to speak to her like this who did he think he was hermione you might as well just lay down and open your legs it going to happen sooner or later with your consent or without it draco gave a small laugh that sent chills up her spine or maybe you need harry or ron here to get you in the mood i saw your picture once in one of those tabloid magazines pictures of you with ron and harry draco said my father was disgusted so was my mother but i let just say i grew a bit more fond of you in your little skirt and knickers he smiled evilly i thought of sending a couple copies to your family in fact i still have them i wonder what dear old grandmother would say stop it draco hermione shouted stop it draco he mocked and hermione began to scream like she had never screamed before but draco kept going shut up shut up i dontwant to hear anymore she yelled then shut me up hermione shut me up and shut me down before i get to you because once i do i wont stop i ll do things to you that you ll never forget what i ll do first is i swear to god draco she began if you utter one more word i will have you laying at my feet she finished pointing her wand straight at his heart do it hermione once i get to you i wontstop i wontstop and you ll never forget that all of it happened because you were a filthy little mudblood coward now stop me hermione held her wand steady and felt the words forming i see you want it okay i going to fuck you into oblivion avada kadavra the words roared off her tongue and the clearing echoed in reverberation she heard draco shout something in response but the clearing was filled with such a great bright green light that she couldntsee and once it was gone she fell to her knees draco was on the ground sprawled face first not breathing oh my god she yelled crawling over to him i didntmean it oh my god draco i swear i didntmean it she sat back on her butt and pulled draco dead lifeless body into her arms and cradled his motionless head sobbing so hard that her rib cage ached and threatened to explode hermione did not see his eye lids flutter nor see his mouth move did it work he asked and hermione stopped sobbing looked at him looked through him then began sobbing all over again once she was settled draco tried to comfort her you i though i had killed you she shouted why didntyou give me some kind of sign i didntknow what was happening i wasnteven breathing as far as either of us knew but now his voice faded off and hermione face broke into a smile we did it they shouted and hermione lunged at him knocking him backwards while kissing his forehead eyes nose and mouth all at once so glad that he was alive that he was still breathing that he was still here to kiss her back we did it and thus ended one of the worst yet best days of both of their lives a n if it was hard for you to read imagine how hard it was for me to write i should let you know if you haventcaught on that draco had to make her really hate him because otherwise the spell wouldnthave worked he said all of that to make her hate him and what better way to make granger hate you than attacking her innocence the thing she prides herself on the most i hope you like it even if it is a bit vulagr and please dont report me for abuse this is completely symbolic the language used was for effect and i apologize if you were offended understand that it is very important to the chapter and i dontwant my story to be r rated because it not and everyone always assumes that r rated fics are well quite frankly smut but its not thank you all sooooooo much i should sign off before i get carpal tunnel chapter 38 snape finds out snape woke in the dead of night he had been there again watching waiting lurking he tried to shake the images from his mind but this was his curse to remember to relive every single second of that night the night that had changed his mind about being a death eater the night he had made his first kill the shadows were dark it was a new moon they had gone to the house at just a little past seven but now it was eleven and they were all growing restless he looked to his right julian persad eyes met snape and he smiled his cold darkened eyes glistening with malice you ready for this one severus the persad asked the boy was three years younger than snape yet had enough bloodlust for both of them and more snape could see the eagerness and felt a pang of doubt when his reaction was not the same he wasntexcited just apprehensive after all they werentattacking just anyone this was a very important muggle family what taking so long snape asked and persad shrugged he didntmind waiting waiting the best part old man he hissed the words slithering over his tongue like saliva there a difference between waiting and being set up i think your source was unreliable severus snapped his voice filling with the familiar air of authority and superiority he did hold a higher rank than persad could ever hope to obtain at his age but persad missed that it obvious they arentgoing to shh here they come persad interrupted and snape felt a pang of fear you ready boys persad asked and the three other death eaters there gave small woofs and howls all down the line until it reached severus who was breathing heavily he had heard the plans they were to go in once everyone had gone to bed and lights were out then they were to kill them kill them all and leave the dark mark high above their roofs for people to stare at in fear and wonder word is you dontlike the killing so that leaves you the third room on the right on the second floor it should be a storage room if anyone in it though you know what to do persad said and it was slightly frightening to severus that persad at only sixteen was so good that this knew so much what were they doing lights out in twenty minutes persad estimated and someone challenged it soon there was a full scale bet going and to no one real surprise twenty minutes later all the lights in the house were out and everything was ready to go lenin you owe me thirty galleons paris twelve and severus good old severus you didntbet a knut did you have you always had such a tight hold on your purse persad asked and severus glared his lip curling let just get moving i want to be home in bed by one my wife going to wonder said someone to his far left and severus actually allowed himself a brief moment of shock that right some of these men had wives families feelings how can you even look your wife and children in the eyes after doing no not doing enjoying something like this severus wanted to ask but as always he kept his mouth shut all these men were killers but severus wasntin it for the killing he was in it for justice and the power to administer it if his father had been any model of a male muggle then severus figured they all deserved to die all right let move in be real quiet nobody wants a live wild muggle to deal with here especially one with a classic gun collection bigger than my house persad said and there were scattered chuckles severus followed the others closely and once they were all inside the house everyone tiptoed to their positions and a second later the chaos began as always severus hurried to his place and slammed the door he didntwant to hear the woman scream as he knew she would and sure enough a second later a woman shriek filled the house but was cut off very suddenly then severus heard the loud shouting of a male then muffled cries as severus comrades committed the worst crime a wizard could he listened to them torture that man and he leaned his forehead against the door trying to be elsewhere but the fact was there was no escape from the horrible truth of where he was and what he was doing turning slowly a sight that filled him with horror came to view in the darkness he could make out two small beds and from the starlight shining in through the undraped window he could see small toys scattered across the floor and saw to his utter horror that the walls were a pastel pink this wasnta storage closet it was a child room severus paused unable to handle the thought of what he had been told to do he had figured that when the time came he would be able to d it but looking upon the small sleeping forms of the two children he forgot to breathe then he realized that the screaming had stopped the woman and man were dead now together in a heaven severus no longer believed in these children were orphans they were better off dead stepping forward severus pulled his wand from the innards of his robes and shakily held it up he would kill the girl first he decided that way if the boy were to awaken the girl would not have to see her brother die but as severus opened his mouth to say those two words he froze the little girl rolled over groaning a bit as she smashed her small beautiful and fair face into a satin pillow clicking her tongue in sleep she looked like his niece his little niece who lived far away now just like her in fact the door opened squeaking loudly and severus turned to face persad what the hell are you doing severus it time to go persad snapped looking at severus shaking hand you fucking prick severus began quietly you knew didntyou you had to you scouted out this house a week before we came severus said you cantbe a death eater if you donthave blood on your hands old sev persad snarled i haventkilled a man and you expect me to kill two sleeping children i will not give you the satisfaction you can condemn yourself severus stated dropping his arm resolutely to his side all right then it no longer your choice persad stated you do it or you die persad raised his wand pointing it right at severus heart and he took in a deep breath now do it do it while they re sleeping persad urged stepping forward deeper into the room his eyes glistening believe me severus you dontwant to see their faces you ll never forget persad said a haunting quality in his voice that severus had never heard before it could have been an echo of humanity i won t severus said and persad laughed you will he said flatly moving closer you will or i will he threatened and severus smirked it was an idle threat that severus had already offered but i ll do it slowly and make you watch you are these kids only hope for a quick painless death i like the screaming too much to end it with two simple words and you know it do it now severus while they re sleeping severus lifted his wand paused let it fall again then lifted it once more do it or you re all going to die right here in this room voldemort doesntlike cowards severus and you know it he ll find out about this and kill you anyway i d be doing you a favor just do it and it ll be over you ll never have to kill again severus walked out into the sunlight in shock suddenly being a death eater was wrong so wrong that he wanted to take a gun and put a bullet right through his own skull but not before he put one through voldemort s how does one twist the mind of someone so young as persad into something so unlike a human brain that the boy didnteven recognize divine innocence the kind you can never be forgiven they had spilled the kind of blood that clings to your hands until your last dying breath you may never be cleansed of it it was then he came to the conclusion that being a death eater wasntat all about what he had joined it for there were no friends now that voldemort had come to complete power only competitors there was no fun only murder and corruption but most of all there was no happiness it held no joy they were like empty robots shells tools as he entered his small home he walked into the bathroom and opened his medicine cabinet they had taken his razor again damn them damn them all for denying him the little control he had looking into the mirror severus didnteven recognize himself his pale grotesque skin clung to his face not in youth but in lean animosity his eyes were sunken in almost yellow his hair was greasy and lifeless what have they done to me what have you done to yourself kill me he whispered to his reflection kill me kill me kill me he shouted over and over again until he reached the breaking point and threw his fist into the glass mirror punch after punch until blood was leaking from his hand and arm like a dripping faucet i dontwant to be a death eater anymore he sobbed sinking to his knees i dontwant to be a death eater and that was when severus decided instead of killing voldemort he would destroy him and later that day with bandages tightly wrapped up and down his arms he found the man he once called headmaster severus rolled over at dawn shoving his face into his pillow letting out an agonized groan just as he had done every day since he had committed that unforgivable crime i sorry jennifer i so sorry collin he whispered the day after he had done it he had looked up their names and ages jennifer had been eleven going on twelve and collin had just turned fourteen the day before a half an hour later severus rose maybe this was why he had never married maybe he felt as though a wife may intrude upon his little ceremony weaken it or destroy it he knew he would never have kids not after not after that he wouldntbe able to look at them let alone allow himself the gift of loving them he didntdeserve it stretching he thought about the day ahead he then showered and readied himself for a day of lesson planning shit he exclaimed as he remembered dumbledore little surprise meeting there would be no lesson planning today all of the staff the member of the ootp specifically had matters to discuss one of which was draco malfoy dressing himself rather hastily severus fled through the halls like a shadow being chased through hell once he reached the meeting room he took a moment to compose himself then turned the handle and allowed himself entry into the small staff room you re a few minutes late severus dumbledore said unsurprised yes there were things that needed to be taken care of before i could grant myself leave of my chambers severus replied and dumbledore nodded in understanding dumbledore was the only other person on earth and hell who knew what severus did every morning in fact it was dumbledore whom had suggested it to a disturbed twenty year old who was depressed and contemplating suicide well dumbledore asked come in severus stepped into the room and took his seat at the end of he staff table looking around he saw every face he was used to seeing except one who was missing but who was replaced with someone whom was not welcome remus j lupin as i was just saying i am a bit worried for mr malfoy who recently began a leave of absence called for by his mother most suspiciously malfoy gone severus asked dumbly truly shocked and dumbledore nodded gone to his mother home once again dumbledore nodded but narcissa never calls for the boy it was always lucius and even then it was always for for voldemort severus said and dumbledore nodded yet again a n in case you were wondering how draco knew that voldemort had reached his mother and he knew it a wise boy this malfoy dumbledore said wise beyond his years what are you talking about wise he is stupid he is a stupid boy for leaving when he knew it could be only one person summoning him severus shouted banging his fist on the table but this time malfoy has a plan dumbledore said the only reason he left was for fear of how voldemort got to his mother whom long ago was placed under lucius protection from the dark lord as we know many sacrifices were made to assure both the boy and his mother safety there were nods of agreement all down the table but severus could still not get over the fact that draco was not in the school you let him go he asked i did not have a choice severus unless i had hard evidence to suggest he was taking part in some illegal heinous activity there would be no reason by law that i could detain him here against his will as well as his mother s dumbledore replied sadly there was nothing i could do severus draco made the decision and he is the only one who could have he feels as though he needs to save his mother there is no saving that woman severus stated let draco figure that out on his own dumbledore said meanwhile i leaving severus stated as he stood find me a suitable substitute i want my potions class to be up to date when i return severus demanded severus there is nothing you can do even if you were to leave right this moment things need to play out as they were meant to malfoy must choose for himself the best path for him to follow dumbledore said quietly now sit down and finish the meeting i cannot sit here and talk about other things while the boy i have tried so hard to fix is being exposed to the very thing he needs the least severus snapped that boy is unstable the slightest thing could tip the scales with him are you ready to face another tom riddle because that is what draco malfoy is he has nothing to lose which makes him just as dangerous as lord voldemort himself he has plenty to lose not enough i have to go headmaster fire me do as you will i will not lose this boy not to voldemort i ve given that monster enough severus finished and he left and whose idea was it that we not let snape find out remus asked as he pointed to himself then he crossed his arms over his chest leaning back that would have done none of us any good remus and you know it dumbledore said i just hope severus is in time i too old and too tired to deal with another dark lord god only knows how much longer this body can hold up it seems as though the wizarding community is bent on testing me to the very limits of my power he paused sighing i very tired and he was remus had never seen him looking so old as he did right then it was then that every single soul at the table realized that this would kill dumbledore an i figured i would agive my opinion on what happened to snape it makes me sad to think about it this way but life is sad i hope you liked it things are slowly starting to drift to darkness if you haventnoticed hermione has the next chapter all to herself and we wont know what going on with draco hehe hope you like wondering p s persad is pronounced per sawed you know like he sawed through the table the thought of someone pronouncing it wrong was driving me nuts chapter 5 repercussions of the red and gold oh that evil woman hermione shouted and ron cringed harry laughed but it quickly turned to a cough as hermione gave him an evil look of her own it could have been worse ron whispered and hermione laughed how do you suppose that all the gryffindor could have been put in the hall but it seems that she just doesntlike y me doesntlike me she nodded and sighed let go and see hagrid she suggested and the other two nodded as they walked through the large front doors hermione began talking very fast didntanyone else notice that that woman was not the witch at the feast dontthey know that there was no alias dark until today draco and i had det wait since when have you e ver called that git by his first name hermione ron asked and she shrugged i didnteven think about it but honestly ron they re not going to put me in azkaban for calling a death eater son by his first name she replied hastily wondering why it was such a big deal how do you know if he just a death eater son and not one himself harry asked and hermione sighed loudly i don t harry it just seems highly unlikely that dr malfoy can juggle muggle torture school and learning dark spells and but she stopped talking and paused but besides that it has nothing to do with what i wanted to talk to you two about she exclaimed as they reached hagrid hut it ll have to wait then i guess hermione said and harry nodded in agreement all three of them knocked on the door simultaneously and hagrid opened the door a grin spreading across his face as he saw them come in come in you three he said his booming voice echoing through the grounds after he had sat all of them down and poured some tea he joined them at his table that was roughly the size of a whole tree trunk how ya been harry he asked and harry looked down as he always did when questioned about himself i okay he said slowly and hagrid patted him on the shoulder three times and hermione cringed it looked as if he had hit harry hard enough to break his shoulder brave boy always ave been hagrid said pridefully hagrid frowned suddenly and hermione looked at ron who shrugged what the matter hermione asked quietly nothin jus worried bout buckbeak with sirius gone harry hermione ron cringed there ll be no one lookin after him as if he just realized what he had said hagrid covered his mouth with his large hand do they know where he is buckbeak i mean harry corrected himself as they all looked at him horrified expressions on their faces i know sirius he dead harry said angrily i not going to pretend that he isntso you can all just stop trying to protect me from the truth ron patted him on the back and harry jerked away hermione could see that he was trying so hard not to feel what he felt harry it all right to talk about it we re your friends through thick and thin mate ron said and harry gave them both a weak smile harry looked at them looked down and braced himself as if he was about to say something crazy but i dontthink sirius is dead harry said quickly i mean the spell he was hit with wasntthe adavra kadavra and well who is to say what beyond that veil thing he paused and looked at each one of their faces hagrid was looking at him as if he were a very young child telling a crazy story about bears in the house who wrote all over his stuff and hermione and ron looked doubtful i dont feel like he dead harry whispered in a last attempt to plead his insane case harry sirius fell through the veil we haventseen or heard from him since ron said slowly i know that but maybe he needs help getting out maybe he only trapped i just cantgive up he all i have hermione looked away as her eyes filled with tears we know sirius meant a lot to you he went to school with your father and all but what you said isnttrue you have us you have dumbledore you have hermione you have hagrid me and you have sirius memory harry nodded but hermione could tell he didntfeel as though it was good enough we had better go it getting dark outside hermione spoke quietly and hagrid nodded i have some goundskeepin ter do myself he said as he stood to his full height of over eight feet tall watch yerself harry and dontgo doin nothin unsafe ye hear don go lookin fer ghosts harry rolled his eyes when hagrid turned but agreed sirius isnta ghost he my godfather harry said as they made their way over the grounds and back to the castle look harry hagrid right we can look into everything we can about the ministry of magic and everything in that department of mysteries but before we do anything like last year we must consult dumbledore hermione could tell harry had thought she was going to say something very different and said thanks hermione i appreciate it once up in gryffindor tower harry went straight up to the boy dormitory i have some homework to do ron called up the stairs and harry waved goodnight before disappearing into the sixth year dormitories hey hermione can you help me with my potion homework i couldntfind anything on the antiveritaserum solution except that it makes you dishonest hermione heard his voice trail off when he saw that she already had her potion book out and turned to the right page hermione had the feeling he wanted to talk to her but instead ron just sat silently at the table and began writing his essay halfway through hermione saw ron look up at her but she didntlook up hermione he said slowly and hermione put down her pen and met his stare this is what she had been waiting for dreading she wouldntsay no but she couldntsay yes without feeling guilty about krum who wrote to her weekly yes ron she replied he cleared his throat and began slowly the weather was nice today eh he asked and hermione smiled he looked so hot and bothered that she couldnthelp but laugh what he asked and she could tell he was slightly irritated just spit it out she said and he gulped i wanted to know if you would erm like to be my wouldliketobemygirlfriend he looked away and stared hard down at his book so hard in fact that had he looked any harder she could imagine him burning a hole right through it after a minute of silence hermione saw ron turn red oh well i understand we are good friends after all and well i should go to bed i drained ron stood and hermione grabbed his sleeve what he asked and hermione felt her throat close as she looked at the look on his face he was so hurt and she hadnteven answered his question yet yes she said breathlessly and suddenly she didntcare that krum existed at all ron was here and he was real his mouth twisted into a grin and he met her eyes searching for some sign really he asked and she nodded he sat back down at the table and he looked too excited to contain himself hermione was feeling quite glad herself he would be her first boyfriend since krum had left to go back to bulgaria and she wasnteven sure if he counted looking at ron hermione felt a pang of something she recognized as doubt but brushing it aside she helped him finish his homework and did her own the common room slowly emptied and eventually it was just ron and hermione and a few other gryffindors either doing their homework or speaking in hushed tones it was almost eight thirty and soon she would have to leave for her second and last detention i have to go hermione said at five minutes until eight thirty and she stood ron looked up from his essay a surprised look on his face where re you going he asked detention remember hermione answered shortly i just hope malfoy doesntsend me to the hospital wing this time she said before thinking you went to the hospital wing what d he do and why he not expelled he asked his ears turning slightly pink i not sure what happened all i remember is well the detention and waking up in the hospital wing she said as she slapped herself inwardly for saying anything at all madame pompfrey told me he was the one who brought me to the hospital wing and doesntit seem a little odd ron finished look ron dontdo anything that ll lose us points it fine i i took care of it already she knew that ron had been itching for a way to get malfoy back for what had happened to his father i have to go hermione repeated when he didntrespond promise me she pleaded ron looked up at her and shook his head i can t he cantget away with everything he does everything ll be fine hermione go serve your detention and be careful hermione threw her hands up in surrender and left in a huff ron was being ridiculously irrational about the whole thing everyone who did that to his father had been apprehended or would be it was the ministry job and he was going to get not only himself but their whole house into trouble not to mention he was going to need help for whatever he was planning if he was planning at all and that meant harry getting involved although hermione rational side had a point so did her emotional side if her father had been attacked and put up for display like they had found arthur she was not sure how she would feel about the son of one of the not yet apprehended death eaters and for all they knew he had been there watching or joining in as she walked through the corridors a new fear flickered in her chest this was her second detention but with a new teacher would the one before it count and more importantly what had happened to the dada teacher they had met the more she thought about it the weirder it got until finally she let it go tired of being confused entering the classroom a completely different picture from the night before met her eyes crabbe and goyle were seated on both sides of malfoy and all three of them looked as if they had just stopped talking as she entered the room hermione was suddenly dreading tonight detention the teacher didntlike her and the three slytherins sitting silently and angelically at the front of the class were not exactly boosting her morale she knew they had something planned and that knowledge had an affect on her that she would never admit to as she sat at a desk near the back she waited patiently for the teacher after five minutes the slytherins stood and draco said oh well guess it canceled then crabbe and goyle followed him to the door and hermione stood what re you guys doing she only a few minutes late and you re going to get us into trouble she said and they stopped draco turned slowly no she ten minutes late we re leaving and you re going to get into trouble all by yourself for existing you filthy little mudblood draco said with a smirk and crabbe and goyle laughed you donthave to leave if you dontwant to but personally i dontwant to wait in this filthy room for our filthy morphagus teacher is there any kind of wizard you do like malfoy that doesntmarch in the ranks of lord voldemort and carry the brand of the death eaters said a very cold voice from behind them well if it isntlittle weaselby draco said as he turned to face ron draco nudged crabbe and goyle to step back and they did as they were told i reckon weasley wants to fight me he snarled as he removed his cloak revealing a form fitting green vest with a nicely pressed dress shirt underneath it the slytherin crest was embroidered over his right breast with the highest detail and skill and hermione marveled at his disgusting arrogance not just me malfoy ron said and hermione gasped as harry stepped from behind followed by neville collin creevey and finally ginny hermione could swear that if fred and george had still been at school she would be seeing them there as well i see draco said with a nonchalant wave of his hand that was borderline disrespectful crabbe and goyle were looking to draco for orders but draco gave them none it seemed to hermione that he was hell bent on fighting this one by himself well are we going to fight in here it might endanger your pretty little mudblood and i sure potty wouldntwant that draco snarled suggestively and hermione stumbled forward shouting insults as she took each step back off hermione harry said his face held an expression of such seriousness that hermione knew they had planned something dangerous for this fight pleas dontdo this she said professor dark might be here any time hermione pleaded but ron shook his head slowly miss dark is preoccupied with other things at the moment ginny said and hermione searched her face she should have realized that despite ginny kind disposition she was only human just like ron and as two humans that suffered against the same injustice they both felt the same hatred towards malfoy at first she had wondered what ginny was doing here but now that she knew it all made sense neville she began but even though his wrist was slightly shaking the look of determination on his face was too real to underestimate looking upon the faces of all the gryffindors there for her defense she realized it was not for her it was for their families their friends their peers harry had lost both his parents and his godfather to death eaters closely related to draco ron and ginny father had been tortured for what the ministry disclosed as days neville parents had been driven insane by death eaters through cruel means of torture and collin brother had been killed over the summer by a group of death eaters who had been bent on killing a muggle born the night of the twenty fourth of july collin birthday i ll be joining you then she said as she took her wand from the folds of her robes this is not your fight ron and ginny said at the same time but hermione continued her walk towards the door like hell it isn t she said you are all my friends and friends stand by one another hermione brandished her wand at crabbe and goyle and they moved aside allowing her to walk beyond them hermione felt herself jerked backwards and her wand flew from her hand as draco grabbed her by the hair and pulled her against his chest you re a very unusual mudblood draco said cruelly when asked to fight you refuse but when asked to keep your filthy nose out of things you dontunderstand you join in he said slowly very odd dontyou think weasley you d think with your blood and your half a brain you could make your girlfriend a bit more obedient draco pushed his wand against her temple dangerously and smirked you know what weaselby do you know how amusing it was to see your father dangling upside down his arms flailing about while he screamed in pain he screamed like a woman when my father got done with him and afterwards you know what he did draco paused enjoying the look of anguished horror on both ginny and ron faces he cried he sobbed like a woman ron stepped forward and draco threw hermione to the side pulling out his wand almost gracefully i d rather fight in the hall if you know what i mean more room eh but at that point no one was listening words were being screamed and curses and spells were flying every which way colors bursting from wands like there was no tomorrow hermione found herself in the middle of the fray soon enough and after five minutes of combat she was sporting a complementary bloody lip from goyle and a number of small cuts from being pushed around by crabbe who seemed to find her an amusing object to play with until that is she had cursed his face so badly that it was unrecognizable but as the fight carried on hermione was hit with one spell too many and everything went silent as she fell to the floor with a thud of flesh and bones the last thing she saw was ginny face above her and then darkness comfortable easy worriless silence hermione woke with a killer headache only to realize she was lying on cold floor as she sat up she saw that the fight was over draco and harry were the only ones standing ron looked dazed ginny was unconscious neville was twitching and laughing on the floor and collin where was collin hermione looked all around the large hallway and her eyes fell upon a horror she wish she hadntseen collin was lying on the floor a few feet away a crumpled pile of body and cloak hermione got onto her knees and crawled across the floor reaching out for him as she neared she slipped in something wet looking down she saw that it was blood collin was lying in a puddle of blood his blood acting on impulse hermione placed her hand right above collin mouth to see if he was breathing she let out a strangled cry harry collin not breathing she shouted and harry looked away from draco who also looked their way both harry and draco ran across the hall get away this is all your fault hermione yelled at draco so loud that she could feel her vocal chords scratch and you she shouted in harry direction making him jump if you could have let it go dissuaded ron or at least tried collin wouldnthave been here draco was walking away and hermione rounded back on him dontyou leave she shouted he your own kind slytherins help slytherins those are the rules draco said as he continued walking but hermione could tell he really wasntall that worried about crabbe or goyle fine malfoy walk away like you do everything take the easy way out it seems like it the only thing you can do properly hermione whispered as she looked at collin draco turned slowly and glared i dontsee any of you over here helping slytherins do i his voice was low and menacing and hermione realized he was bleeding freely from his nose they haventstopped breathing please i dontknow how to do this i just dontknow and hermione snapped they heard it she knew but she didntcare she stood slowly and brushed off her robes turning away from harry and draco from young collin she made her way through the corridor and up the staircases towards gryffindor tower it was too much to handle she knew she should have gotten a teacher but at the moment her body seemed bent on fainting and there was little she could to stop it nothing actually her vision faded just outside the portrait hole the fat lady cries for help were the last thing she heard chapter 6 sly ideas from the dragon in the house draco could have sworn the next few hours after granger left were hell it had taken him over ten minutes to bring the gryffindor back to life by resuscitation and potter had been absolutely no help he just sat there open mouthed looking guilty but in the end they had cleaned up their mess and it was an unspoken but known thing that no one would speak a word of the battle that had taken place on the first floor corridor draco was quite sure no one would want the story of him single handedly fighting off five gryffindors with very little aid from his idiot friends and his saving the small one from near death circulating around school but he had less to gain than even they thought it would ruin his image as a slytherin and as a malfoy if anyone else found out about his heroism though he would not call it even that draco thought of it as a means to an end and the gryffindors must have known when they started this whole mess that he was going to pay them back in excess and if they didn t it wasnthis fault draco leaned his head back against the back of his four poster and sighed he was so tired but he couldntsleep something was bothering him something that would not go away could it have been the fact that he found out where crabbe and goyle had been the day before no he had always known they were destined to become death eaters draco was unaware that the dark mark could be distributed to students underage students at that but he had no doubt the dark lord had his reasons could that be it was voldemort haunting him once again but again the answer was no draco had gotten used to the fact that voldemort would always be a part of his life a long time ago and then draco reached the point of his memory of the past day events that bothered him the most mudblood granger had yelled as she had never yelled before he was sure and it wasntonly at him this time she had screamed at her beloved potter as well and if draco didntknow any better it had all been worse for potter but then again it was potter fault that all this happened in the first place he was born and then survived it was a fact that he would suffer but no one said he was aloud to fight back let alone drag four other gryffindors down with him and then there was weasley tragically brave weasley who had the guts to pull a wand on one of the darkest wizards of voldemort company son that had been a mistake although draco himself could hardly blame him draco words had been aimed to hurt and they had fulfilled their purpose on a grand scale for a second draco even doubted their necessity but that was over and done with before he had blinked again the gryffindor deserved what they got they were all the same every single one of them they sat there on their pedestals with their lions on their chests judging everyone else but looking no closer at one another than a stranger would at least slytherins observed and calculated their own they knew what everyone else was capable of and that in itself was a great advantage and despite popular belief not every slytherin was dark and evil destined to become great muggle hating death eaters that was the destiny of a select few draco himself included draco disliked the fact that he had no say whatsoever in his career path but nonetheless it was his path more than anything else he could do it was in his blood his history every fiber of his being had been bred for this for perfection he was smart good at everything he tried genuinely talented in all areas of magic and knowledgeable on everything dark he needed to know and finally he was good looking not a very important piece but a plus anyway as draco thought of his talents he also thought of his flaws he was selfish a definitive slytherin quality was socially inept anyone who wanted to be successful in the higher wizarding community needed to kiss up to him and finally he was close minded muggles were disgusting wizards who liked muggles and married them were more disgusting and the offspring of one of those unnatural pairings were the most disgusting tainted blood was no longer politically correct but to draco it was dogma integrated into every aspect of his life since birth brainwashed one could say draco looked at the clock on his bedside table shouldntyou be asleep asked the woman in the backdrop of the clock nearly twelve thirty dontyou have classes tomorrow sod off he said and rolled over so it wasntthat late at all he still had a very good shot at getting eight or nine hours of sleep closing his eyes he tried very hard to think of things that would put him to sleep and one of those collin creevey head settled in a puddle of blood was not one of them but as he gradually became drowsy an image stuck in his mind it was not his choice of course but she was there nonetheless diana swam before his eyes like a dream integrated into a nightmare one did not wish to relive but along with the face came memories the best of draco life when he had been young and his mother more able to protect him from his father ambition draco could hear her voice almost as if she were there with him and as he lay there curled into a ball underneath his thin blankets he wished she were there he felt alone all of the sudden even though he was surrounded by at least thirteen other sleeping bodies but sleep was gaining on him chasing him until he was too tired to fight it any longer there was too much to think about too much to remember in one night and he regretted it when sleep fell over him like a veil of dark silence it would be the kind of dreamless fatigue induced sleep brought on by either medication or the brain lack of will to think while the rest of the body surrendered to relaxation so draco wandered into what seemed like the opportunity of sleep he had been missing since he was twelve two hours later he woke drenched in sweat suddenly the room was closing in on him sucking the air from his lungs and he forced himself to breathe slowly calming himself draco sat up and swung his legs over the edge of his four poster angrily it was the same dream the same goddamn dream he couldntget out of his head opening his hand he stared at it wondering why he was being plagued with such ominous dreams god damn he cursed under his breath as he hit himself with his open palm twice more he hit himself wistfully hoping that it would make the ache in his head stop draco called a cold voice from the deep recesses of the shadows and draco looked all around the dormitory only to find silence and the same black emptiness it always held it not over he whispered to himself this was just more of the same dream more of the same sick fear he felt constrict his stomach whenever he imagined that beast in the forest draco now draco knew it wasnta dream someone was calling his name and as draco realized this one thought shot through his mind who the hell what the hell do you want he said rather loudly we need your help came the whisper now accompanied by many other voices we who are you he asked pushing the covers off of him and to the side when there was no answer he merely rubbed his eyes and sighed ever since that first detention he had been hearing things short whispers of wind that mussed his hair as he walked through the corridors the tapping of feet behind him when he was in a deserted hallway draco stood and stretched his arms high above his head he pulled his boxers up just a little higher so that they covered the downy soft trail of hair from his navel and gave a loud but muffled yawn he ran a hand through his golden hair and placed his hands over his face it was a long time till morning and draco wasntabout to waste it by sitting around in the dormitory waiting for the nightmare or the voices to come back he was going to sit around in the common room waiting for the nightmare or the voices to come back there at least he felt warm giving another yawn draco walked to the dormitory door but stopped dead he wasntabout to go unarmed that had almost turned into a mistake walking quietly back to his dresser he grabbed his wand and a pair of slacks along with his cloak and for some unbeknownst reason he grabbed a pair of fresh socks once curled up on the green velvet slytherin couch draco placed his cloak over himself and began to doze he was almost asleep when he heard a knocking noise from just beyond the slytherin entrance he immediately jumped up and pulled on his slacks he clasped his robes tightly and readied his wand draco neared the door and heard footsteps passing outside someone was out there and draco would rest just a bit easier if he knew who it was draco opened the entrance to the slytherin dungeons slowly so as to not make the hinges squeak as they were prone to do he looked down both hallways but saw no one but he heard them stop stepping on my foot whispered a quiet voice harshly not my fault you re always underfoot move to your right and we ll be fine there was silence now ron both of you shut it i sure all of hogsmeade can hear us draco could have laughed just then potter and the dork parade were at it again breaking the rules seemed to be a favorite pastime of those three gryffindors draco couldntpass up this perfect opportunity two could play at the invisible game draco reached his wand up to the top of his head and tapped hard it was as if an egg had been broken over his head and was dripping down his body concealing him looking down at his hands they were in fact the floors and he smiled success running quickly and stealthily down the hallway draco quickly caught up and once he was level with a suit of armor he tapped it whispering a few words under his breath then he stood back and watched in anticipation suddenly the suit of armor came to life and began dancing to a tune only he could hear granger jumped out from seemingly thin air and let out a loud shriek but her mouth was soon covered by a hand that was obviously attached to an arm that was most likely and undeniably attached to a person under what draco now recognized as a very valuable and rare piece of cloth potter had an invisibility cloak this fact suddenly gave draco so many options opened so many doors potter had an invisibility cloak third year all the sudden rushed back to him he remembered the attack on him crabbe and goyle in hogsmeade but most vividly he remembered seeing potter head a head that was no more aloud in hogsmeade than the body itself potter had once again wormed his way out of a very sticky situation and draco was suddenly feeling very un gryffindor like he wanted revenge revenge for all the stunts potter weasley and granger got away with before long a detailed plan was spinning in draco mind a plan that would definitely tickle the fancy of one of hogwarts staff members that was not too keen on potter draco cupped his hands over his mouth and smirked wickedly yelling at the top of his lungs peeves it echoed so badly that for a moment draco was frozen to the spot and then he remembered he was invisible the moment his shriek pierced the silence and echoed from wall to wall he heard the bantering voice of peeves the poltergeist someone called did they he asked his childish face reflecting the joy draco felt draco could see his shadowy form behind mudblood granger of course he couldntsee her but he could certainly smell and feel her it was completely silent and draco was beginning to think that they once again wouldntget caught but then something draco hadntthought possible happened there was a sneeze from under the cloak and peeves smiled an awful smile that draco mimicked oh peeves said feigning understanding ickle students out of bed at night cause for a celebration he shouted and draco cringed letting out a short laugh as granger ran with weasley right behind her leaving potter in his invisibility cloak to fend for himself no doubt he had told them to run but that was not the point not at all draco waited and waited he wanted to see this happen had been waiting for it for years there would be no excuse for potter this time no way out but he was wrong peeves was now sniffing the air with a relish and draco realized that potter had gone after the other two losers it was just him all alone out in the hallway now and if he waited here much longer he would suffer the fate meant for potter draco stormed down the corridor his bare feet hitting the stone floor so hard that his feet began to go numb from the constant assault on the tender nerves of his soles draco was pissed and he didntcare if peeves knew he was there or not vladamir draco shouted at the stone wall which moved aside revealing the entrance into the slytherin common room he stepped into the warm room and slammed the newly appeared door shut with a loud bang draco threw himself up against the stone wall and let out howl of frustration he was breathing so loudly that he could hear his pulse beating in his temples and became slightly disoriented god damn it he bellowed banging his fist into the wall repeatedly until he could feel blood trickling from his knuckles down his arm fu pathetic came a whisper from behind him and draco turned ever so slowly he could have sworn it was the voice of his father he has potential another voice began given the proper training they could both no not the girl her mother is quite fond of her though i cantbegin to tell why quite a useless girl she could have use to me said the cold voice that draco recognized from the jump start his heart gave i always have room for more in my company draco strained his ears the voice had trailed off where is your wife asked the voice of lord voldemort i i dontknow she left hours ago she doesntlike to be around when we hold our meetings she quite fragile i want to see her tell her to bring the boy yes milord i shall fetch her right away there was silence and draco listened closely in case he was missing something but soon there were shouts and draco could hear a sobbing woman you promised lucius you promised me shut up there was a loud smacking sound and draco cringed he could hear his mother scream out in pain give me the child said voldemort in a quiet almost calm voice no no you promised me lucius you said our children were safe from him narcissa cried out her voice going hoarse did you voldemort asked draco father in an amused voice get the child for me there was a silence in which draco was sure that his father hesitated now the dark lord yelled and more of his mother screams filled his head please dontlucius no draco could now hear a small child crying and as he realized who it was his stomach did a flip and he felt nauseous hold out his arm lucius the dark lord asked no no no narcissa screamed as if she were dying there was a loud sizzling sound and draco felt a sharp pain in his left arm and the child cried out it hurt like nothing had ever hurt him before he could feel his flesh bubble as the brand was pressed deeper into the tender flesh of his arm and he felt himself begin to shake with the effort to conceal his screams that hid just an inch from the surface no draco shouted and he woke with a start as someone tapped on his shoulder what the matter with you asked crabbe who was standing over him an uneasy look on his face draco thought of a lie quickly and gave him a reassuring smirk that he didntfeel had a dream i married a mudblood gruesome that one was eh he joked and crabbe laughed loudly time it draco asked groggily as he sat up and wiped the perspiration from his brow he realized he was just in his boxers and looked around the common room for his robe but he wasntin the common room he was in the sixth year boy dormitory it seven did you move me up here draco asked suspiciously but crabbe lacking the brains required to lie shook his head why draco he asked and draco shrugged thought i was asleep somewhere else all he replied and crabbe smirked with pansy eh draco smiled back at him with what he hoped was a mischievous smile who else he stood and his body was wracked with a shiver that ran all the way from his feet to his brain i need to get changed he said as a weak cover and he went to his dresser his wand and everything was placed neatly on top of it and draco tried to put this odd puzzle together had it all been just a dream draco let out a yelp of pain as he scraped his injured knuckle across the drawer knob damn he cursed what happened asked goyle who had now joined them in the dormitory i but the look on crabbe face seemed to be the easiest lie thing got a bit rough and well you guys get it yeah mate crabbe replied suddenly draco was struck with an idea of such brilliance that he almost knocked his stuff off of his dresser i have to go draco said and he dressed as quickly and neatly as he could he then sprinted out of the dormitory down the stairs through the great hall and into the other dungeon hallways where the potion master was professor draco gasped as he ran through the door mr malfoy if you dontseem a bit distraught snape said as he stuffed a large piece of parchment into the drawer of his desk what is it i can do for you i have already written out the paperwork for your classmates to join you in arithmancy class if that is what you are inquiring about no i was thinking maybe i could borrow a draught of veritaserum draco said and snape looked suspicious but walked to his supply cupboard all the same what may i ask do you need it so desperately for mr malfoy he asked as he extracted a small clear bottle from the innermost recesses of his cabinet draco didntwant snape to know the truth not yet anyway but he knew the only way to get the potion was to tell a convincing story that snape would go for goyle and i want a bit of information from the gryffindor quidditch team new tactics and all draco said with what he hoped was a winning smile we want to win the cup he added hopefully right then snape said mcgonagal has become too complacent snape walked over to draco and handed him the small clear bottle a single minuscule drop will do mr malfoy he warned and motioned him out of the door thank you professor draco called back as he left the classroom he looked down at the bottle in awe and drank in its appearance it was so little but could do so much make so many talk when they had no will to do so on their own mudblood granger would have to be the one he asked she was weak and as far as he knew she was the easiest one of them to get a hold of with a twinge of what seemed like sweet happiness draco smiled widely he was not merely going to make potter life a living hell he was going todestroy it sorry it so short but it a chapterwhich i shall call a necessary seemingly pointless introduction to a character no one likes less than me well you know what to do and if youdon t i apologize i have no qualms with illiterate people chapter 7 when a malfoy says no lucius malfoy stepped into the house expecting no less than what he deserved the dark lord was very angry with him very angry indeed looking carefully around the dusty entryway he felt his heartbeat accelerate it was not the fact that he was scared of the dark lord he could just be very persuasive when he wanted something done and he was very short with failure and news of failure is what lucius was bringing with him he had been sent on a very important mission but had come back with no more information than he had left with every trail he had taken had ended up in a dead end even the one he himself had discovered it seemed as if dumbledore secret society was going to stay secret at least for a time lucius took a calming breath and began the ascent up the large staircase upon reaching the top step he looked around as he had been told the house held a certain amount of eerie silence even though one of the most wanted men in the ministry was residing here he slowly walked down the dark hallway and tapped on the door with his cane when there was no reply lucius straightened up and opened the door inside was a high backed chair that was set in front of the fire curled into a loose coil next to the chair was nagini the snake voldemort favorite pet though it did not move lucius could see its eyes following him as he walked further into the room it had better be good news lucius said a sharp voice behind the chair and lucius jumped slightly yes milord i mean no lucius stumbled over his words like a fool and voldemort called for silence have you discovered the residency of dumbledore society voldemort asked straightforwardly when there was no answer he stood no names he asked while he straightened his cloak and turned to face lucius no place no names and no leads i ll assume i will not lie lucius i am very disappointed you told me even before you left that you were the wizard for the job guaranteed it in fact i well it was more difficult than i had originally anticipated milord there were not half as many probable leads as i was told there were lucius stammered i was given bad information milord this is certainly not my fault alone lucius could feel perspiration leaking down his back as he looked into the cold eyes of lord voldemort i see and i was led to believe that most of the leads that we had obtained came from you lucius was there a misunderstanding there as well then he asked and lucius shook his head i had good information there just wasntenough enough lucius was suddenly lost for words and terrified about it enough what lucius resources money information men i gave you enough resources to hunt for the city of atlantis lucius money i gave you enough of that to live the rest of your life buried in gold and information you and i both know how much of that you had at your disposal i admit that man power could have been a bit more accessible but lucius the fact is that i dontthink that would have mattered lucius was shaking now he had an idea of what was coming it happened to all those who disappointed the dark lord and he was next now do you want to tell me what really happened voldemort asked and lucius looked down at his shoes no that a shame lucius but you know what i must do lucius nodded while meeting the dark lord eyes once again but before i do i would like to inform you of an idea i have recently brooded on if you accept i may be lenient with you but refuse and you will pay in full voldemort said in a bemused tone yes anything milord lucius floundered and sighed a sigh of great relief i would like your son to undergo the ceremony of the dark mark soon he said his voice telling lucius that it was unavoidable in the end milord that would endanger you greatly i have been informed that you have already given the dark mark to crabbe and goyle sons it would be very suspicious to do that and finalize your loyalty to me i see how easy it is for you to stay only partially committed but the fact of the matter is that i cannot waste any more time on death eaters who are not completely loyal to me it a bit dangerous you see voldemort said his eyes squinting as if he was trying to see into lucius brain and suddenly he felt naked i understand where you are coming from but i cannot to take the boy out of school would be a risk i am willing to take and if you are half as influential as you brag about you will do a good job of covering it up just like you covered that attack on the weasleys yes i know about it i am not a stupid wizard malfoy and you will do this or you will die voldemort shouted and lucius cringed i see you will not do this without a great amount of persuasion and seeing as i cannot write out a note for the boy myself i will either kill you in the process of negotiating or narcissa will do it for me and you know how fond she is of the boy lucius nodded so there was silence and the dark lord nodded i accept your decision though i may not respect or understand it self preservation has always been one of your greatest priorities and whether it is love for the boy or something else entirely i dontknow the dark lord sighed a sigh of fake regret and as voldemort pointed his wand at him lucius could not look crucio he shouted and lucius felt as though every nerve in his body was on fire he cried out in pain and fell to his knees it felt like his body was being split in two and for a second he lost all sense of time and space and was unaware of whether or not he even had a body he came in and out of awareness sporadically and all he could see was red spots in front of his eyes then the pain stopped lucius groaned and before he could do anything he heard the word muttered somewhere far from where he was crucio and it began all over again chapter 8 the sacrifice even after hours upon hours of thought draco still had no idea how he was going to coax granger into being alone with him without seeming overly suspicious this draco decided would be the most difficult part of his plan assuming everything else he had planned went perfectly draco spent the past two weeks brewing a not overly strong vial of a sedation draught written out a list of questions to ask the mudblood and was now scoping out locations that were inaccessible to students and most unlikely for teachers to suspect unbeknownst to them draco had already gained the help of three fellow slytherins just by listening in on casual conversations he had heard of three secluded places in which some slytherins brought their lady friends and were never caught there was of course the room of requirement which draco had initially been fond of but had decided against the transfiguration classroom a most adequate candidate considering its security and finally the potions classroom that he would not pretend otherwise was his first choice can anyone tell when and why griswald the goblin took his clan over the mountains and into british territory professor binns asked in his boring monotone voice as his eyes swept over the classroom lazily draco looked up from the parchment he had been scribbling upon he rose his hand slowly into the air and waited patiently yes mr malloy professor binns said turning his transparent eyes towards draco draco had accepted this as his new surname only due to the fact that their ghost teacher was incapable of change griswald left germany in 1687 in order to free his clan from the prejudiced lives they lived and to help heighten focus on goblin rights when they entered british territory however they discovered that they had left one oppressive land just to enter another draco did not lookup as the teacher nodded correct ten points for slytherin professor binns said in an unsurprised tone that left many slytherins and hufflepuffs staring in draco direction he immediately moved on deeper into the lesson draco knew that some wondered how he had known the answer but a better question would have been how could he not griswald was one of the most well known figures in the history of the dark arts revolution which was required reading for a malfoy after griswald migrated his entire clan wasting all their resources and money he was approached by gladatorian a dark wizard who had an offer griswald could not refuse griswald was paid to torture and kill witches and wizards who had information about the rising of the ministry of magic with cruel and unusual techniques acquired from germany when the ministry of magic was firmly established griswald was found guilty of murder and conspiracy to overrule a government his entire clan was killed and their heads still guard the gates to the german ministry of magic in berlin draco yawned and leaned back this was one lesson he could afford to sleep through he knew but instead he would plan draco had thought of luring her away from her gryffindor friends under the false pretense that he had to speak with her about important prefectorial matters that would have been a logical approach considering both her and draco were second year prefects but so was weasel and draco was sure granger would insist upon him being present if weaselby did not himself there was also the option of getting them both detention again but that would seem suspicious then again draco thought with a smirk there was always kidnapping miraculously the answer to his problem arrived with the morning post the next morning in the form of a chestnut brown owl with a lazy eye though his first reaction was anger as he absorbed the words he let a smile tug at his lips he had begun to think of crazily elaborate ideas for getting granger alone with him like beating weaselby unconscious hiding his body in a broom closet sending a letter to granger telling her to meet weasel in the potions classroom where draco would in fact be waiting way too much work to put into a simple interrogation looking over the letter again he nodded mr malfoy you have failed to attend one out of the two detentions you have been given if you are not in the defense against the dark arts classroom at nine o clock tonight the consequences will be dire the letter itself could mean only one thing draco cold gray eyes wandered across the hall and fell upon a certain mudblood named granger the look on her face said very clearly that she had gotten one as well hermione eyed the note that she had just received with mixed feelings in one sense it was what she deserved which was a relief but on the other hand she was furious with mcgonagal hermione had served more than enough extra time with gryffindor enemy number one draco malfoy rabid smirks sharp snide words and emotionally void personality were getting old fast hey hermione seen harry at all hermione turned to see ron behind her before he sat down in the seat next to her he gave her a lazy smile that said he was exhausted and she shook her head no but we have to talk ron smile faltered and a serious expression fell over his face if it about last night i didntmean for it to go that far he stopped talking as she held up her hand for silence i would have helped you anyway ron but i dontknow if i understand why it did get that far she said and he looked down at his hands which were being wrung nervously what he said about my father it isnttrue my father did not cry ron said his voice filled with bitterness hermione shook her head but by letting him get to you you let him win she said in a calm voice and ron glared in her direction so if your family was attacked by death eaters and your father tortured like an animal you re saying that you would always be logical and calm i admit that i acted purely on impulse but what would you have done let him sit there and tell stories like the little bastard he is i think not ron paused to catch his breath hermione had noticed that his voice was steadily rising the more he remembered the truth is ron i dontknow what i would have done but i doubt i would have risked the lives of four other gryffindors for some revenge trip and that is just what you did hermione felt her cheeks turning red colin could have died last night what would you have done then i ll tell you what i would have done hermione i would have packed my bags and left i would have taken full responsibility for what happened i d say goodbye to hogwarts in an instant if he would have died he was breathing hard as he continued what about ginny and harry and neville and what about me ron what if you would have gotten one of us killed when he didntanswer she nodded i really dontthink this is going to work between us we re two very different people and you re a lot less mature than i thought you were w what ron sputtered indignantly i dontunderstand what you mean why hermione saw his cheeks turn red and the hurt expression on his face was enough to make her throat constrict she really did care about him but she would not sacrifice what she believed in just to placate him i understand your hatred for lucius malfoy believe me i your biggest support on that but draco is not his father she was about to correct herself but it was too late to divert disaster ron ears turned a deep shade of red and his eyes narrowed with suspicion somebody seems to be unusually close with our slytherin prefect and dontyou tell me it educational the second the words left his mouth he wished he could have said anything else hermione slowly stood and shouldered her bag how dare you she shouted and ron cringed away from her we had detention not exactly the breeding grounds for a good relationship and besides that did you completely miss the fact that we hate each other hermione could not believe that she was being forced to justify this well you have been spending a lot of time with him and you seem to like defending him ron said in an almost reproachful voice somebody has to she shouted and ron guffawed look ron i understand that what his father did was terrible and he deserves to be punished but taking it out on the people who care the most about you will only hurt you when you do this blame everyone else you have to realize that someone like lucius isntgoing to be the one who ends up alone you are hermione eyes filled with tears she didntwant him to see that his words had cut so deeply but they had i am just shocked that you think i would have anything to do with him if you had even the slightest doubt that he was involved with what happened to your father and it hurts to know that that is how much you trusted me to begin with hermione turned and left storming out of the great hall hundreds of pairs of eyes watching her as she left draco watched in amusement as he saw granger stand and shout something at weasley after a few more words were exchanged granger left the hall bag clutched so tightly in her hand that her knuckles were white and tears were streaming carelessly down her face he had to hand it to weaselby it had lasted longer than draco had ever thought possible in weasley case draco initial bet on how long the relationship would last was an hour but weaselby did not only exceed that he had made the mudblood cry how draco felt an emotion like indifference come over his mind he didntknow but he could care less about it then again draco also had to give granger some credit it was obvious she had been the one to break it off and if it was out of pure common sense or sheer stupidity it didntmatter her and weasley were too compatible it didntseem right draco thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a black owl in front of his plate he immediately recognized it as his father and reached forward to grab the note attached to its scaly leg after the note was separated from the owl it swooped off the table in a graceful way and flew out of the hall draco dear your father gone missing be careful draco turned the note over expecting to see more a message in code anything at all that made sense but then draco thought it all made perfect sense his father was missing and he had just left two months before on a secret mission for the dark lord and his mother was warning him which meant she had reason to believe draco was not safe self preservation was draco first priority and that meant staying away from those closest to voldemort those within his inner circle draco felt sickness come over him as he thought about the potions teacher here at hogwarts he was in close proximity to the dark lord and had only been biding his time for the past few years as the hogwarts potions master and head of the slytherin house but draco attended hogwarts school of fricken witchcraft and wizardry he was more than safe considering that saint potter was currently enrolled thinking too hard or is what you re thinking actually painful asked a cold female voice from behind him please go away he hated these little chats before classes each one always seemed to end a bit more unpleasantly than the last that not what you used to say draco you used to want me as much as i still want you pansy whispered leaning forward just far enough to where he could see her face out of the corner of his eye get the hell away from me draco said with not even a hint of a joke in his voice make me she said challengingly leave me the hell alone or i fear you may become the first girl i ever hit he said turning to meet her eyes somehow with your father being who he is and your mother being his little punching bag i find it shocking that you are such a disappointment to the malfoy name draco stood and pushed her backwards away from the table and she lost her balance hitting the floor with a thud of flesh and bones you may be an expensive whore but that doesntmake you worth my time draco said with a sarcastic smirk you certainly werenttalking like this in those moments in which you were helpless to control that mouth of yours she gave him a smile that told draco she knew more than she should she arched her back and let out a laugh that made a shiver of pure dread run up his spine i dontwant to be like them pansy i am not my father pansy oh you re a waste of my time draco spat and pansy laughed wickedly draco turned and left the great hall in a rush as he walked up towards the library he could feel the blood rush to his cheeks he had never been more embarrassed she had announced his most intimate thoughts from his most intimate moments in front the whole slytherin table and a few more around the hall he should choose his partners more selectively he admitted bitterly but he did not take full responsibility for what had transpired between him and pansy he was more than sure his father had not been completely innocent of the entire affair considering he had introduced them at a point in time which draco had hardly been able to ignore the simple fact that he was male and pansy was very much a female pansy was not one to talk about inability to keep to oneself those few precious moments in which she was silent were those in which draco could say that he truly had lost control and when she wasntsilent she always had something vulgar or something seemingly seductive to say not that draco had fallen for her charm in any sense he had never fallen at all the attraction between pansy and himself had been purely physical and now that that aspect of their relationship was over he owed her nothing and vice versa it should have been a clean split but pansy had insisted upon making it more difficult than necessary like she couldntlet go of her ambition to bear the malfoy name draco let his thoughts of the events in the great hall drift away as he neared the library he was willing to let everything from that chapter of his life be forgotten and lost among the many memories he held deep in his mind those memories that only surface in dreams draco opened the door to the library shutting it quietly behind him and walked to the very back corner near the dark arts section he set his bag on the table and unclasped the front pouch searching through his bag blindly draco heard something from the corner just as his fingertips met the quill he stopped moving and strained his ears he turned and began following the noise walking down the nearest shelf of books the sound grew louder and more familiar as he turned the corner it suddenly sounded a lot like granger draco asked in astonishment as his eyes fell upon the bushy haired mudblood sitting in the corner tears streaming from her rather plain brown eyes what are you doing here she snarled as she tried to wipe the tears from her face as if he had never seen her cry before well i came to find the dying cat and put it out of its misery but considering it you and it against the law i ll be minding my own business now he said with a cold smile he turned to walk away but stopped himself nah never suited my personality to mind my own business he turned back and glared he not worth it you know weasel not quite as grand as everyone thinks and with that he walked arrogantly back to his table where he read until the bell rang upon entering the dada classroom draco sat at the front table with crabbe and goyle who were very excited about something congratulations goyle whispered while patting him on the back for what draco asked with a frown as he looked at his two friends faces that seemed to be glowing with some secret he did not know the dark lord wants to administer the dark mark soon maybe this week crabbe said and draco gave him a glare of caution sorry draco thought you d be excited this is what you ve been waiting for and now we ll all three be bonded closer than brothers crabbe apologized and draco nodded excited why would i want to throw my life of independence at someone else feet when it has barely begun why would i be excited about pledging everything i have to the success or failure of one wizard who is but a man draco sighed he wished he could have told them how he really felt but he held back he had to yeah crabbe was about to say something when professor dark entered the classroom she walked to her desk and sat down staring at them expectantly well open your books and turn to page three ninety seven she snapped causing the classroom to jump to action all at once draco wash sure the wind draft he felt on the back of his neck had been caused by a certain mudblood raising her hand as quickly as humanly possible to point out some error professor we arenteven on chapter two yet granger said quietly and draco turned she was sitting at a table with two other gryffindors surprisingly enough neither one of them was potter or weaselby the argument must have been good he thought with a smirk as he turned back towards the front i know that miss granger and the second you run this class which wont be any time soon you will be able to decide in which order we learn defense against the dark arts professor dark said and draco along with the rest of the class was forced to muffle his laughter into his sleeve does anyone in here know what an alidore is she asked and draco knew granger had her hand raised but watching dark eyes pass over that side of the room draco made a decision based solely on his imagining the look on granger face i dontexpect any sixth years to have draco raised his hand and dark met his stare with her vividly electric blue eyes mr malfoy alidores are a darker cousin to the centaur they like centaurs are bound from telling lies but may twist the truth so terribly that it becomes only a shadow of what it began as draco paused they are also able to hypnotize their victims into a false sense of security by accessing their emotions and displaying a fa ade of character that not only proves false but fatal finally and least importantly they are very capable diviners as well he finished why do you say that that is the least important of their powers mr malfoy dark coaxed and draco took the bate he knew too much on this subject to feign ignorance humans are the alidores natural enemy and from birth they are taught stay away from us it is law to them and the only time they ever find themselves in contact with the human race is when they meaning elders transform from half horse half man into human form even then they are told to handle these limited interactions with great discretion draco could have added but it seemed that he had said just what the teacher wanted to hear thirty points to slytherin for mr malfoy in depth knowledge of one of the most dangerous and darkest creatures of the wizarding world she said with a smile and draco looked down at his book to avoid the many stares he had just received but mr malfoy i have one final question draco nodded and she pushed her glasses up onto the bridge of her nose what makes the transformation from centaur form to human form difficult for most alidores draco was silent for a while trying to figure an easy and short way to word his answer i dontexpect you to the alidores may transform into humans but there is a small catch draco began they may not transform into the same gender meaning that if a male alidores wished to make the transformation he could only become a female vice versa with female alidores this makes it very difficult for the alidores to fit into human society due to the fact that only senior alidores can make the transformation and they have spent centuries being a certain gender it makes their job of fitting in much harder and less convincing thus their number one defense mechanism becomes a dangerous possibility alias dark clapped her hands together loudly and smiled like he had never seen a teacher at hogwarts smile before brilliant ten more points for slytherin once the class quieted again she settled down alidores are also very violent creatures said a female voice from the back of the class and the smile on draco face faded the professor looked at her skeptically before nodding go on she said shortly and granger looked flustered after hypnotizing their prey alidores generally crush the bones in the human skull or back in order to assure the body stays in tact she finished and alias nodded but why miss granger would that matter if they are only to be eaten her voice suggested she knew but she was leading the lesson in this manner today letting the more advanced students teach the rest of them well alidores have beliefs very similar to celtic tradition she began they believe that if the injuries they cause to a human breaks the skin the soul of the witch or wizard leaks away which the soul is the only reason they killed the person in the first place granger explained slowly also they only kill very powerful and talented witches and wizards because they believe that once consumed they will absorb the power from that individual they killed is there anything else anyone would like to add to our compilation of facts on alidores professor dark asked as she looked around the room when no one raised their hands she sighed fifty points to gryffindor for miss granger extensive knowledge of the violent nature of the alidores and ten points from gryffindor for her inability to contain herself the rest of the class draco spent bitterly taking notes on the different kind of centaurs there were around the world when the bell rang he did not wait for crabbe and goyle but went straight to the transfiguration classroom on the second floor when he entered he still had six minutes to wait so he took his seat at the second table from the front and pulled out a piece of parchment and his favorite quill scribbling idly his parchment soon transformed into a comic strip about a know it all gryffindor that could not stand to keep her mouth shut for more than five minutes as draco sat scribbling he realized just how glad he was that gryffindors had charms class all the way across the school as far as any class could be finally the bell rang and as draco looked over his drawing he laughed putting it away he seemed drawn to her surname it was a pleasing word as far as syllables vowels and consonants went but something else about it made him look twice granger it sounded original but his thoughts were interrupted by mcgonagal as she stormed into the class her face was red and she was shaking with fury he pulled out his year six transfiguration book as did the rest of the slytherins and all the ravenclaws put your books away she snapped and the class did just that i guess the ministry of magic has other plans for you other than lessons she ranted quite loudly these are portfolios fill them out or you will not graduate from hogwarts with a wave of her wand the folders were distributed rather violently at every table write your names on it and follow the directions yes miss patil what are these asked a black haired ravenclaw girl in the front row they are a collection of your best works from year one to seven draco was distraught this had the ring of something that wouldntlast for very long and soon he found out why at salem school of witchcraft and wizardry they have instituted this program and they seem to show improvement never mind that our test scores started out over twenty percent higher completely dismiss the fact that no one has the time to monitor these meaningless folders filled with clutter and even forget the fact that they re bloody americans she shouted and students all over the classroom cringed immediately after the students began to look through the requirements hands were raised into the air yes miss patil mcgonagal asked i donthave any work from first through third year i donteither i guess you re in trouble then yes mr dowerlain professor we werentgiven a charms final exam two years ago professor i dontknow what this means no hang on enough mcgonagal yelled pulling at her hair put these away and i better never see them out in my classroom again this will have to be something that our temporary replacement headmaster will deal with she calmed down as did the rest of the classroom and draco sighed a sigh of relief this class had been on the edge of chaos and had it continued he was sure mcgonagal would have killed someone open your books to page one twenty seven chapter three she said miss collins read the introduction to transfiguring reptiles into fashionable furniture and once that has been read all of you please grab a snake from the bins at the front of the classroom the first lesson on transfiguring reptiles into fashionable furniture is changing a diamond patterned snake into a square of diamond patterned cloth the process itself is quite easy while using the wand waving technique on page one twenty nine figure eleven recite the incantation ornamentum transformo loud and clearly while pointing your wand at the snake you wish to transfigure collins finished reading and everyone walked to the front draco caught the hang of the spell after three tries and soon was aloud to move onto larger reptiles along with three other students at the end of the class he had made three chairs enough squares of cloth to make a patchwork quilt and a couch with metallic scales that looked like it belonged in the slytherin common room after transfiguration draco went directly to the slytherin common room where he took a short nap read and watched the flames consume the wood in the fire while waiting for the allotted detention time to come around when the time did turn eight thirty draco walked up to the boy dormitory and to his dresser he cursed quietly as he once again scraped his wounded hand across the drawer and pulled an oddly shaped pair of socks from the bottom of the drawer the veritaserum he though excitedly as he eyed the clear bottle in his hand he placed it into the large pocket of his robe and turned to leave he didntthink he had ever walked so fast to get to detention but he couldnthelp being excited he was about to ruin potter perfect life shatter the trusting relationship between the three famous gryffindorks and make a name for himself in slytherin besides his surname he entered the classroom to find it void of anyone he figured he must have arrived pretty early and leaned his head back against the chair he had been correct soon granger walked through the door and with a frown he noticed that her eyes were rather puffy and her nose red as if she had just been crying again she took the seat in the far back and waited for alias dark to arrive conveniently crabbe and goyle did not show up until right before dark did herself welcome to detention anyone wish to tell me why you re here she met each of their eyes with a scrutinizing look like she was trying to see into their minds mr malfoy does it have anything to do with your record of being out of bed past curfew mr crabbe mr goyle could this have to do with your following nature and finally miss granger could it have to do with your undying curiosity of other people whereabouts at all times of day and night draco could not help but smirk he found it hilarious that she had hit every point as accurately as if she had been the one assigning the detention now to fairly decide what we shall do with the two hour detention you owe me she was silent for a moment and then explained her decision well first i shall break up your little cliques or should i say clique mr malfoy you will work with miss granger crabbe and goyle you ll be on your own anyone care to guess what we will be doing draco was the only one to raise his hand clean muggle style draco offered hopefully and thank god she nodded you and miss granger will be cleaning the trophy room and mr crabbe will be scrubbing the male lavatories on the second floor and mr goyle the first floor alias dark looked over each one of them again and nodded decisively disperse and they all left going their respective ways in their assigned groups an hour later draco was cleaning a trophy the size of a small horse and granger was on the other side of the room shining the awards chamber slowly as time went by they both moved towards the center of the room and draco was desperate for conversation even an unpleasant one with the mudblood his mouth was dry and his throat was sticky from disuse you and weaselby broke up eh he asked in a casual tone and granger guffawed like it is any of your business it half your fault there was trouble in the first place walking around in the middle of the night all over the grounds you should have been expelled she growled while scrubbing the plaque twice as hard as was good for its finish look if you do it right we ll be out of here in a few more minutes but if you scratch it to pieces we ll have to sit here until one of us can piss a new one draco said spitefully as he tore the plaque from her grasp looking at the name he laughed potter wouldntbe happy about you treating his father award like that hermione grabbed it back and glared you dontseem to be near busy enough work on this one it should have sentimental value to you she thrust an award into his hand and as he looked down his half cocked smirk faded and his blood ran cold under his skin making him shiver how the hell would you know what has sentimental value to me mudblood he asked bitterly as he shined the special services award that had been given to tom riddle in the fifties hmm let me see your father being who he is your friends and their fathers being who they are i willing to guess you all stop over at little old voldie house for a spot of tea every friday granger said boldly and he could have smacked that smile off her filthy little face i d like to see you call him that to his face right before he killed you of course he said slowly as he set the plaque carefully back up on the shelf and i sure you d stay just to watch the show you seem to get a lot of pleasure out of torturing people she spat and he growled i dontspeak primitive ape or moron malfoy so i guess this conversation is over she stood and walked to the door but draco lunged after her grabbing her by the arm let go of me she yelled trying to yank her arm free but to no avail draco pulled granger head backwards by her hair and pulled out the sedative she squirmed but despite her struggling he poured the blue liquid down her throat and she became almost instantly quiet and almost entirely compliant draco helped her walk across the room to a chair in the corner he had not planned to do it here but this would have to do he thought miserably pulling out his parchment he looked over the list once before pulling out the bottle of veritaserum what re you doing she slurred and draco measured out a small drop of potion in the vial lid to shove down granger throat take this he said and handed her the lid she did and he decided he would test it out before he got to the real questions he might as well have some fun with this anyway granger are you in fact a filthy little mudblood he asked with a smile yes she said in a monotone voice and draco smirked have you ever gone farther than a kiss this one was aimed to embarrass her later on no draco sighed in disappointment why did you break up with weasley he immature and retribution is his only focus retribution for what retribution for what your father did to his did you make weasley cry he asked moving away from the whole uncomfortable subject of revenge yes draco laughed out loud at this and decided on one last question what do you think of draco malfoy he was feeling very cocky at this point and believed granger would cater to his ego draco malfoy is a slimy self centered pratish ignorant and arrogant git that tries too hard to be everything that slytherin stands for harsh draco pulled out the list briskly and asked the first question where does potter hide his invisibility cloak he asked eagerly i am unable to say what in the hell what is the current password into gryffindor tower twinkle bee granger said monotonously what is potter greatest secret i am unable to say where is sirius black draco was becoming desperate for any shred of information this wasntworking and he couldntpretend to know why i am unable to say draco pulled out the veritaserum again reading the label and gave her two more small drops which was more than enough to make her talk now where does potter hide his invisibility cloak i am unable to say god damn it what the fuck is potter secret he asked i am unable to say he lunged at her angrily and grabbed her by the hair once again he tilted her head back forcing more of the clear liquid down her throat than he probably should have but he didntcare even when he was faced with an empty bottle he had planned so well for this everything had been prepared beforehand and granger was ruining everything she had probably cast a concealment charm on herself to keep potter and his slimy secrets safe where does potter hide his invisibility cloak he asked for the third time in his trunk at the end of his bed what is the combination to his lock one three seven nine eleven three now he was getting somewhere you know draco granger began and he snapped up looking into her glazed brown eyes you really arentas bad as you want to think you are you try much too hard to please those who know your father and in the end you re going to be the one to pay voldemort wonttake your attitude very long and then where will you be dead perhaps what the hell the matter with you draco asked and granger shrugged over enthusiastically tipping over and out of the chair hitting the floor with a thud i just feel like telling the truth that what you wanted she laughed as she stood swaying on her feet look i done with this draco said and granger nodded i answered all your questions then yes now just wait here til morning someone ll find you eventually or the drug ll wear off i dontwant to stay here alone i want to go with you she slurred as she stumbled unsteadily towards him as nice as that sounds i have to say no she tripped forward over her feet and he caught her around the waist before she fell she hung in his arms for a minute and he looked at her her eyes had a gray tint caused by the overdose of veritaserum and she was suffering from the same side affects that alcohol caused from the sedation draught at this point she was worse than inebriated you need to sit down and wait here he said softly and his expression became kind as she nodded he helped her back to the chair and she cooperatively sat once he made sure she d stay in place he turned to leave but she caught the sleeve of his robe he tore it out of her grasp and continued towards the door please dontleave me in here it will get dark when you leave i dontwant to be in the dark she pleaded her voice stumbling over the words as her mind tried to make sense of her scattered thoughts draco the way she said his name made him hesitate she seemed genuinely scared even if there was nothing to fear here except for rats and mrs norris lamp like eyes when i was little my father used to leave me in the dark he promised me that nothing would ever happen to me but he lied draco tried to close his ears but she had caught his interest he knew he shouldntlisten to her these were things that he wasntmeant hear and what happened he asked and draco could have kicked himself in the teeth this was not his business i grew up i wasntscared of the dark for the longest time until voldemort came back granger began to sob and draco turned back around the expression on his face was a mixture of disbelief and stern indignation arentyou ever scared to go to sleep when you know he out there waiting but i suppose you know where he is and you know what he ll do i do get scared just like everyone else granger draco conceded dejectedly i just hide it far enough under the surface to keep my dignity and wits about me draco admonished gruffly if i worried all the time about everything and everyone else i d get lost like you are how can you be so apathetic people are dying draco stop calling me that he shouted and she went silent and i know that i know people are dying granger i not nearly as ignorant as your gryffindor friends make me out to be he snarled people die every day granger and if you grieve and regret for every single person who does you ll be cheerless and despondent for the rest of your life people we know no granger people you know everyone i know was smart enough to choose the right side i did you choose draco or were you told granger asked sordidly and draco was temporarily lost in thought i told you not to call me that he said dangerously in barely more than a whisper this is over now get up so i can help you walk to your tower he held out his arm for her and she latched on leaning most of her weight against him it was a long and most uncomfortable walk to gryffindor tower and draco was beginning to regret his whole plan of revenge this turned out to be more of a pain in the ass than he could have ever imagined he admitted he should have been a bit more frugal with the veritaserum but it wasnthis fault that she had been well a filthy little mudblood how should he have known that by giving someone more than three times the regular dose they lost not only their mind but their ability to shut the hell up there she said while pointing upwards as they reached the stairs can you go up on your own now he asked passively and she nodded but as soon as she took her first independent step he had to reach forward quickly and steady her dontbe stupid if you need help dontbullshit me i donthave to help you you know i know she said looking back at him good now dontlet go or i ll let you fall on your ass and laugh about it his words could have stung but the tone in which he said them was not entirely convincing they took each step one at a time and when they finally reached a portrait of a robust woman granger stopped go on granger he snapped as she stood there staring at him do you know my name she asked dreamily and draco shook his head defiantly he did know would he tell her that no would he ever call her by it probably not in their lifetime my name is hermione draco nodded slowly and he felt the urge to do something that completely defied every ounce of common sense in his body dontbe too angry when i forget he said as he moved towards her you won t she whispered and he shook his head how can you be so sure malfoys forget things so easily his voice trailed off just inches from her mouth her lips you re not a very good malfoy draco felt the urge fade and stepped away instantaneously shivering what had he almost done goodbye draco she said as he began to walk away yeah whatever he shrugged while turning just stay the hell away from me if i hear you call me that again i ll find some way to make your life miserable he threatened emptily you already do he heard her say and she muttered the password to the gryffindor common room when he looked back up the stairs she was gone he made his way sightlessly to the slytherin corridor vladamir he said quietly and the stone slid aside upon entering draco walked straight up to his dormitory where he crawled into bed and slept the best sleep he had had in over three years he had so much on his mind he couldntdream he merely entered darkness and settled there resting waiting for the moment he would have to return to painful and imperfect reality chapter 9 the black letter and the blue tongue hermione woke with the worst headache she had ever had there was something nagging at the back of her mind but she just couldntgrasp at anything substantial it felt like her skull was threatening to split sitting up she pushed the red comforter and gold sheets away from her it was way too hot for them leaning forward hermione groaned aloud as she placed her palms over her eyes the sunlight leaking through the windows was most unwelcome and she chose to stand before she gave into the urge to just roll back over and die as soon as her feet met the floor and she found balance an overwhelming nausea swept through her the floor seemed to shift from under her feet as she ran to the door of the girl dormitory and down the steps it was with great relief that hermione saw the common room was empty right before she threw herself into the girl lavatory where she began retching upon arriving at an open toilet out late and suffering from a hangover why miss granger one might assume the worst said the calculating female voice of parvati patil one of hermione roommates i waited up for you until midnight but finally went to sleep where were you the voice was from outside the stall but it echoed inside hermione head like she was saying the same thing over and over again i i was at detention it took longer than expected hermione rasped as she felt tears come to her eyes every time she tried to stand she felt the nausea return with a vengeance and her blood was beating in her temples making her ears hurt terribly from the pounding detention from nine to one hermione come on it me you re talking to you can feel safe sharing the details parvati said sweetly now who is he no one there is no he suddenly bits and pieces of memory returned to her and she bent over the toilet again wave by wave of vomit doubling her over in pain right fifteen minutes later hermione left the bathroom and walked back up to the dormitory she dressed slowly and uncoordinatedly while trying to recall the events of the night before she remembered the detention but she remembered more than that alone she remembered draco cold gray eyes looking into hers and for fleeting moments she felt feelings rushing back to her like she was reliving pieces of the night but none of these images or sensations led to answers about where exactly she had been at one o clock in the morning and she was just now considering the possibility that she had been with a certain slytherin looking into the mirror she yawned loudly and screamed looking closer at her reflection she saw that her tongue was a dark shade of blue hermione scraped it against her teeth to see if it was some kind of dye but nothing changed keeping her mouth clamped shut hermione walked down the stairs through the common room through three hallways and corridors and finally into the great hall where she saw her friends ron immediately stood when he saw her and began launching into a defensive conversation but hermione stuck out her tongue and he smirked it not funny ron she said guardedly and he put a hand over his mouth what on earth happened harry asked what ginny ron and hermione wanted to know and she shrugged where were you last night ron asked suddenly and hermione rolled her eyes what it a simple question i was at detention since you sabotaged my second detention i was forced to serve another now help me out what kind of spell can cause this because i pretty sure i wouldntdo it to myself you had detention with malfoy right harry asked suspiciously and hermione rolled her eyes once again honestly harry i dontknow what that has to do with it everything that git has everything to do with it dontyou see harry laughed crazily as if she were mad not to see it you go to detention with malfoy the first time and end up in the hospital wing the second time how d you know about me being in the hospital wing hermione asked and ron crossed his arms over his chest a look on his face that said he was curious as well harry looked fleetingly at her then to ron hermione told me yesterday he said and the look on his face told hermione that that was the story oh yeah she said quickly and ron looked back and forth between her and harry suspiciously it completely slipped my mind harry and i were erm studying in the library before first class and t that when i told him but harry was with me the whole time before first class no harry butted in remember when i went to the restroom i really wanted to see how hermione was doing he finished in a rush how she was doing she broke up with me ron said in disbelief and as his voice faded away as hermione tried to read harry face bloody hell you d think you d be trying to console me but it all right ron he was completely on your side but once again we are completely off subject she exclaimed and harry nodded i remember going to detention i remember completing it and i remember malfoy getting really defensive over something i said no you dontget to hear it and then that it she lied with a gulp she had just gotten a new string of incoherent and unfamiliar memories he must have done something i just dontknow what harry sat down at the table and hermione did the same helping herself to a piece of toast and a cup full of pumpkin juice that tasted oddly warm suddenly a very large and majestic eagle owl was swooping towards them and ron ducked just in time for it looked as if it had aimed to take off his head making a perfect landing what the hermione reached forward and carefully untied the envelope from its leg it nipped at her arm again and again but only after she cooed it softly did it let her take the green envelope as soon as she held it in her hand it took flight again taking a large piece of bacon in its beak hermione looked at the envelope a puzzled expression on her face she had never seen that bird before it wasntmcgonagal s it wasnthers it definitely was not ron s she opened it slowly and took out a small folded piece of black parchment she felt dread fill her as she looked at it but she unfolded it all the same inside the writing was silver and for a moment she was unable to concentrate on the words thank you then at the bottom of the page twinkle bee the words hit hermione with the force of a brick everything came rushing back at once and as she sat there she began to swoon ron and harry both spit out their food and reached out to help her sit back up what is it harry asked as he read it over her shoulder and hermione held it up to make it easier for him to read that our password who this from hermione he asked and all she could do was shrug i remember what happened she said shortly and stood hermione where are you going harry asked jumping up after her ron right behind him i have to talk to mcgonagal hermione said while hastening her steps across the hall why what the matter harry grabbed her arm to turn her around and she ripped her arm away having a sense of d j vu let go of me running through the doors she ran as fast as she could to the transfiguration classroom she broke through the doors and stood in the doorway panting mcgonagal looked up while pushing some papers aside inconspicuously yes miss granger mcgonagal asked her face displaying confusion what spell can cause this she asked while she opened her mouth and pointed to her tongue i woke up this morning with a terrible headache i dontremember anything from last night and my tongue is blue i see that mr potter mr weasley please leave miss granger and myself in privacy she said as her lips formed into a tight line and her cheeks paled ron and harry reluctantly turned from the door and mcgonagal motioned for hermione to shut it and come closer you dontremember anything granger mcgonagal asked as hermione stuck out her tongue once again and she inspected it more closely hermione shook her head quickly and mcgonagal grunted nothing odd happened at the detention you were supposed to serve last night you did serve it yes professor professor dark put malfoy and i in a group and we cleaned the trophy room muggle style that all i remember i think he did something to me professor mcgonagal nodded slowly and walked to her desk she scrawled quickly on a piece of parchment and attached it to the leg of her brown owl with the lazy eye it hooted kindly as she patted its head and took off out the window you need to come with me this instant she said turning back to hermione but there was not a trace of that kindness on her face now that the bird had gone and hermione was suddenly apprehensive mcgonagal led her out of the classroom and down the opposite corridor professor where are we going hermione asked in a very small voice as she followed closely on the teacher heels dumbledore will wish to speak with you and hear your explanation before you are punished mcgonagal reply was short and simple and hermione almost stopped dead in the hallway punished what for and dumbledore not here hermione started up after mcgonagal again when there was no response professor she began where are we going twenty minutes later hermione found herself in hogsmeade outside the three broomsticks mcgonagal next to her profess quiet was all she said before firmly rapping on the door three times hermione jumped backwards as the door was flung open and mcgonagal stepped comfortably inside the small pub hermione on her tail in the back minerva said madame rosmerta through cupped hands and hermione rubbed her hands together who was in the back keep up granger mcgonagal snapped quietly and hermione hurried after her she had no idea whatsoever about what was going on and it just got more and more confusing as it unfolded go in i ll get us some drinks mcgonagal said and hermione did as she was told she pushed the door open with a loud creak and stepped inside a small lavishly furnished empty room with a welcomely warm fire she stepped towards it and took off her gloves with numb fingers holding her hands near the fire to gain the feeling back she sighed with gratification good morning miss granger how are you faring this term so far hermione jumped and turned around to find dumbledore sitting in a chair in front of the fire how she had passed over him was beyond her he was wearing something a tourist would he had small sunglasses over his eyes a red ball cap on his head he wore a tropical t shirt that had parrots all over it and even more comically were his shorts and sandals the only thing she recognized besides his small but strong frame was his waist long silvery beard d dumbledore she stuttered dumbly good sir just great and yourself she finished with a forced grin well that would depend on my health which i must say could use some work caught a cold last weekend in poland nice facilities there he smiled warmly at her and hermione could not help but feel relieved that she was here with someone they all trusted so closely well have a seat we can talk more comfortably he said and hermione nodded the knot in her stomach loosening a great deal hermione sat in the purple chair on the other side of the table and dumbledore studied her very closely i heard you had an unfortunate accident that left you with a blue tongue he said and hermione smiled while nodding i suppose its better to have one tongue turned blue than to have none at all happened to one of my friends in our first year at dutston higher school for magical education sad story that one he gave a soft chuckle that turned into a violent cough you all right professor hermione asked while leaning forward to help him he waved her away and composed himself no no i fine i ll be better once minerva brings that drink he rasped so tired these days always having to stay one step in front of the ministry i taught a lot of witches and wizards in my days brilliant witches and wizards his voice trailed off and hermione leaned back into her chair settling professor hermione asked in a small voice yes miss granger why am i here mcgonagal said i was to be punished yet i have no idea that i ve done anything wrong dumbledore removed the sunglasses from his eyes and set them idly in the table he rubbed his eyes and sighed loudly i dontthink it is fair of me to interpret minerva actions miss granger but i will say that unless her suspicions were founded you would not be here the look on his face was one of great sincerity and hermione could only bow her head contritely now would you like to tell me what has been going on hermione nodded slowly and found herself telling dumbledore of all her frustrations how she had only meant to get mcgonagal the night she got detention but had been unable to defend herself in malfoy presence how she and malfoy had interacted that first detention how he loathed her blood and everything that she was but most of all she told dumbledore about her worries about harry he had been places he shouldnthave been knew things he should have had no idea about and that no one ever saw him outside of classes anymore this seemed to have dumbledore on the edge of his seat for his focus was not even interrupted when mcgonagal stepped into the room three butter beers in her hands minerva thank you he said as if he had suddenly woken from a trance come sit and join us it seems there have been a great many misunderstandings between head of house and prefect dumbledore said slowly and mcgonagal nodded taking a seat next to dumbledore on the couch after she set the drinks down dumbledore began relaying hermione side of things to her what i dontunderstand is how mr malfoy got our password miss granger she said it seems highly improbable that mr malfoy used force seeing as how you are unmarked mcgonagal finished and hermione flushed what about spells potions he good at that sort of thing hermione absolved in a rather loud tone i mean it makes perfect sense he does a spell gets the answers he wants and i wake up unable to recall one coherent memory it too convenient to be unbelievable mcgonagal narrowed her eyes but this did not deter hermione not in the least and what kind of spell or potion could malfoy have used to get past your self cast memory charms you are a brilliant witch miss granger and no doubt went through only the greatest security measures to ensure your friends safety dumbledore interfered tranquilly i dontknow veraxus probitus a veritaserum potion i canttell but he did something i would never have told him our password and if you believe me capable of such betrayal then you might as well send me home today she finished as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared tearfully at her shoes that will not be necessary dumbledore professed in an exhausted tone after he took a long swig of his butter beer i will make sure that this occurrence is well investigated and as always i encourage you miss granger to delve into your memory as well for we all know things that are never spoken hide deep within our minds waiting for the moment we will shed light upon them once again hermione nodded as did mcgonagal who had surprisingly enough accepted this if you bring me one shred of evidence incriminating mr malfoy miss granger he will be punished as our laws see fit dumbledore said and hermione stood sensing that their meeting was over yes sir hermione replied with a short smile mcgonagal stood and walked towards the door as hermione stood dumbledore called after her miss granger he said yes professor she asked while turning towards him and putting her gloved back on her small hands remember that despite differences every witch and wizard is born with heart enough to be tolerant hermione nodded slowly and the worth of his words stuck in her mind as she left the three broomsticks she had been rather harsh with ron about the whole thing and the fact was he had acted just as she would have had malfoy said that to her she hadntmeant what she said not completely anyway as they walked through the small cobblestone streets of hogsmeade mcgonagal began talking i would hope that you learned from this whole unpleasant business and for at least a few days i would like to see you acting with discretion towards your and your house reputation and mcgonagal did not speak another word until they entered the great hall dinner already begun sit with your fellow gryffindors hermione watched after mcgonagal who walked straight up to the staff table and sat down not looking back at hermione stricken face once hermione felt dirty unworthy as she made her way to gryffindor table where ron and harry were waiting eagerly for news what happened ron asked putting his fork down yeah is your tongue still blue ginny added while craning her neck as if to see inside hermione closed mouth i doubt it mcgonagal would have fixed that by now hermione replied briskly a bit more harsh than she had meant what happened with the password who sent you that letter this morning harry asked aloofly right before he shoved a large piece of bread in his mouth and took a swig of pumpkin juice i think it was malfoy mcgonagal doesntbelieve me and for goodness sakes harry this is not the last meal you will ever eat slow down before you choke on your own tongue hermione exclaimed her mouth hung slack in disgust finish what you were saying quickly i have to go up to the library harry said through a mouth full of food well like i was saying mcgonagal doesntbelieve that malfoy had access to anything that was powerful enough to break my loyalty to gryffindor wait you told him our password and he sent that letter ron asked in utter shock hermione gulped she had not thought this part of the story out that thoroughly the look on ron face could have been applied so many adjectives that hermione stopped thinking of them after angry betrayed flabbergasted and incensed well it wasntmy fault she shouted suddenly feeling the need to defend herself how is that not your fault what could malfoy possibly have had access to to make you tell him that he paused as a new idea formed on his tongue and who knows what else you told him about harry about me hermione saw the look on his face and it made her want to cry it said look at the slytherin spy in gryffindor robes i dontremember convenient ginny interrupted this had to be a nightmare hermione decided as she looked at her three closest friends faces these were not the faces of the gryffindors she knew and loved these were slytherins in red and gold these were slytherins glaring at her staring her down these were slytherins for only slytherins had the heart to listen without hearing gryffindors were always fair and loyal gryffindors always saw the truth no matter how farfetched the idea gryffindors knew eachother well enough to believe without proof hermione met each of their eyes with a glare of hurt and frustration from green to blue each pair of eyes said the same thing look at the slytherin spy in gryffindor robes hermione turned rigidly and walked away from the table her head held high despite the internal meltdown she was experiencing she walked towards the large doors but slowly her direction shifted to a new destination the slytherin table walking up behind him hermione shoved draco head forward and he leapt up turning ready to strike the person behind him that obviously had a death wish what did you do to me she shouted what did you do to make me betray my house a probitus spell a sip of veritaserum or could it be that you were fool enough to use the imperius curse she knew she was ranting but at this point she did not care all she knew was revenge that same revenge that was causing red and purple spots to appear in front of her eyes what the hell are you talking about mudblood i had nothing to do with whatever you re ranting on about he said with a cool arrogant smirk that suggested just the opposite of what his words meant you know you did it i know you did it i just want to know how that all hermione yelled oblivious to the fact that more than half of the great hall was turned in her direction no words that got to be a first no believe me i have plenty to say i just have to word it in a way that wontget me expelled he growled through gritted teeth let hear it then i sure all your friends want to hear how you seduced a mudblood into confessing anything you wanted to hear i sure they want another reason to praise draco the great the child death eater destined for greatness she spat she saw draco hand twitch and for a second she thought he was going to hit her but to her surprise and relief he held back you re the one who took the fucking potion you filthy mudblood he whispered dangerously so only she could hear what potion draco what did you give me that i cantremember a whole single moment from last night just bits and pieces like shattered glass hermione voice was low and she was glaring at him with such loathing that she felt as though not even he could match it but she was wrong if i told you that he began with a maniacal grin i wouldntbe able to do it again hermione reached over the table and grabbed a pitcher of pumpkin juice with only a second hesitation she tipped the pitcher over his head and orange liquid ran through his hair over his face and down his robes making a satisfying splash as it hit the floor and puddled around his feet there were gasps and spurts of laughter throughout the entire hall and malfoy was pissed he shook his hands flinging the orange liquid in all directions and stepped forward his eyes screaming murder but right at that second hermione felt invincible malfoy couldnthurt her he wouldntdare i would say you re a waste of my time but i think it would be wiser and more truthful to say that you re a waste of oxygen as well and space and overall existence hermione uttered before turning away and walking out of the hall like dumbledore had suggested she would investigate and peruse her memories while she did it she needed to go to the trophy room that after all was the last real thing that she remembered and as good a place as any to begin her query it was with rushed steps that she made it up the stairs and through three corridors and entered the trophy room looking around the large room she realized very suddenly that she had no idea what she was looking for she knew she was looking for evidence but what kind of evidence would malfoy have left behind a bottle perhaps a misplaced object or even a thought hermione pulled out her wand and flexed her wrist this was a new spell she was learning and she had never tried it in a real situation before but it was a useful spell difficult to learn even harder to perform but useful waving her wand fluidly she executed the hand motions perfectly while saying acclaro grattia veritas de exuviae her voice echoed in the small room and it went suddenly dark hermione felt as if her body was being lifted from the floor and she began spinning so rapidly that the room around her became only blurred flashes of light and color she felt her stomach rise into her throat and the nausea was threatening to overwhelm her when it suddenly just stopped everything went still and her vision cleared she was slowly set back onto the floor and she wanted to fall to her knees but all of the sudden her frame did not want to listen then hermione realized with a pang of horror it was not her frame it was malfoy and she was actually seeing through his eyes the night before without her consent she began to move forward where was she looking around cold scenery met her eyes this had to be the slytherin common room no other place in the castle besides snape dungeons were this desolate or uncomfortable just as she stepped through the doorway and out into the corridor a still image flashed in front of her eyes in the image was a platinum blond boy with cold gray eyes it was draco before hogwarts he had an innocent smile on his face but his eyes with their gray empty depths told a different story she could tell this child knew more than any child should know with a stab of guilt hermione felt something like empathy for that little boy and what he had become but as suddenly as the image had come it was gone and she was halfway down the corridor on the way to the dada classroom she would assume draco made no stops on the way and ten minutes before detention started draco arrived inside the dark empty dada classroom hermione watched herself enter the classroom and sit at the back with a frown she realized how transparent she had been how na ve she was to think that no one would have a clue that she was upset with tear tracks down her face and red puffy eyes once the detention started hermione just sat back and watched the show as it unfolded they were partnered and began walking towards the trophy room as they walked random images met her eyes but there was one that chilled her from the inside out there was lucius towering over narcissa malfoy his cane raised high over her head but the thing that touched hermione made her choke back emotion was the look on the young narcissa face and the small bundle in her arms did draco have a sibling it seemed highly unlikely considering there had been no younger malfoy enrolled or sorted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry but there narcissa was holding another child as hermione could imagine she had once held draco but before she could ponder anymore she realized that she was already in the trophy room she allowed her attention to wane while they cleaned but as soon as their argument began she snapped to attention she remembered this it was what happened afterwards that had her confused hermione watched in satisfaction as her other self yelled at malfoy and got up to leave but what happened next made her cringe her blood turning to ice in her veins she lunged forward and took herself by the hair pouring blue liquid down her own throat her and draco then dragged hermione to a chair they measured out a bit of clear potion veritaserum hermione could have screamed in elation had she been in her own body but she settled for watching in excitement and horror as she watched herself take the potion handed to her then came the questions they asked hermione questions but the ones about harry she refused to answer how ridiculous hermione thought as anger filled her blood what a filthy little mudblood hermione stopped thinking when those words formed in her mind what was going on but the anger was not subsiding hermione felt frustrated they had planned this so very well and here the muggle born was ruining everything i am the muggle born she reminded herself silently after a few more unanswered questions hermione took the situation into her own hands they poured the whole thing down her throat and watched her squirm there that should make the whipped gryffindor speak hermione thought in satisfaction and fear she didntknow where these thoughts were coming from but she could not control their coming and worst of all part of her liked them after more questions the muggle born began to act strange that was enough it was time to end this quick and clean she wouldntremember anything if they left her here but as he began to walk away hermione felt something a flutter in her stomach and they turned around the gryffindor was speaking and her words tugged at his her heart hermione was all the sudden very confused was she her or was she draco draco said a cold voice in the back of her head and she mentally nodded she must be draco you re hermione no hermione was a filthy mudblood who couldntkeep her trap shut all the sudden hermione lost all sense of herself as she and draco personalities merged his taking over dominating her she could still see but she had no idea who she was or what she was doing with a mudblood at her side walking towards gryffindor tower leaving the teenage girl behind hermione draco turned and walked down the steps walking down the corridor she stopped outside an unfamiliar yet cognizant stone wall they felt the words form on their tongue and she he opened her mouth to speak vlad terminus defixium enough hermione felt herself slam from draco with the force of nothing she had never known before she suddenly knew herself she was hermione not draco never draco hermione turned to face him this was the most angry she had ever seen him before his eyes were just narrow slits his face was tinged with red and he looked like a drowned rat she composed herself and said the first thing that came to mind a sly smile and the words we re even now malfoy you know more than you should and i know more than i should but this she realized was not the right action to take at all that is not even he yelled crazily his face abruptly flushed and his eyes were infused with so many emotions ranging from unbelievable rage betrayal hurt to sadness how dare you how dare you you filthy little mudblood he walked forward slowly a crazed gleam in his eyes and hermione backed fearfully away you have no right i have every right that you do malfoy and you manipulated me gave me sedatives and a truth potion to make me tell you things no one else knows she paused for a minute breathing hard through her apprehension i know what that spell does draco yelled and hermione cringed every thought i have had since last night you saw my thoughts they deserve to be left with me he said and his voice went quiet i have much more to hide so much more to protect than the son of a mudblood st potter i have secrets that would make your hair curl you dontthink i know that remember me i one of harry potter closest friends i know things that could endanger every student at this school including yourself she said in a tone that was formidable to malfoy s and believe it or not i know a lot more about you than you could ever imagine silence fell over the hallway as they both adjusted to the fact that they needed one another silence more than anything so she began and draco eyes met hers a coldness emanating from their gray abyss so what he asked this doesntchange a thing you re still a filthy mudblood and i the son of one of the most influential men in europe dontexpect star treatment just because you invaded my privacy in fact you should expect things to get worse he said with a thoughtful look no really is that possible hermione asked in a sarcastic tone i wasntexpecting anything from you not a damn thing she said as she turned to walk away hey granger he called after her and she turned back to him wondering what on earth he could possibly want from her now he rummaged through his pockets and when he found what he was looking for he tossed it in her direction out of reflex she caught it in her left hand and looked at it you dropped it he said and then disappeared around the corner hermione looked at the necklace that was now in her hands it had been given to her by her mother the year she had been accepted at hogwarts hermione grandmother had given in to her mother when she was married it was a silver moon pendant with a golden star above it and on the outside was the phrase our only daughter our little girl in russian characters hermione carried it with her everywhere she went and she felt extremely guilty for not noticing that it had been missing she felt a fleeting sense of gratitude towards draco for returning it to her but in a whole other sense she blamed him thank you she whispered before turning around and making her way up towards gryffindor tower where she would not doubt feel extremely partial to sleep but life works in mysterious ways and this time it seemed hermione was fighting an uphill battle by the time she realized she was being followed it was too late to avoid confrontation why are you following me she shouted as she turned around and to her surprise a sixth year ravenclaw girl stood in front of her i just wanted to say that what you did to malfoy was bloody brilliant i only wish someone would have done it sooner she said and hermione smiled the name amber lynn solitaire she added holding her palm outward for a handshake i hermione granger and it is a pleasure to meet you she said taking the girl hand in hers so where re you headed amber asked and hermione shrugged with a sigh i was going to gryffindor tower but now i think i ll go to the library and you hermione inquired library too i guess i have nothing to do hermione nodded as they walked down the corridor hermione discovered that amber was a british muggle born who moved to from west chester england when she was seven her father abandoned them when he found out her mother was a witch leaving them with no money and no way to make a living amber had three sisters two of them were squibs but the oldest the one who had graduated from hogwarts two years before and became manager of the international wizards department was now one of the youngest witches that held such an influential position within the ministry amber was proud of her family hermione could tell and when they finally reached the library it seemed as if they had known eachother for years it wasntlong before amber got to hear the story about the other gryffindors who were mad at her and why but it didntfeel like betrayal did you really use that spell i heard it was really dangerous the personalities start to merge and then your mind doesntend up back in your body amber saw the expression on hermione face and stopped talking hermione had been looking at the shelves across the library when her eyes fell upon draco malfoy what he doing here amber asked to read probably hermione replied and amber smiled slytherin can read a few of them can but only really easy things like first year stuff well i should probably get up to the tower i had a very long night last night hermione said and amber nodded yeah it almost nine i better get back to the commons so i can get some help with my astronomy homework astronomy a bitch she said with a laugh and hermione smiled i ll see you around hermione i here to talk even if your other friends aren t amber gave hermione a short wave and walked out of the library hermione followed suit and went to gryffindor tower upon entering though she got many stares that werentexactly welcoming ignoring the glares she made her way down the steps and into the sixth year girl dormitory where it was unusually quiet as she dressed and slipped into bed after a while the talking started again is she asleep asked someone from the other side of the room and someone bent over hermione who closed her eyes and tried to breathe evenly yeah did you hear she gave to password to a slytherin someone else contributed and hermione rolled her eyes into her pillow i heard she and malfoy met in the trophy room for some action and she let it slip said the voice of parvati patil and hermione bit her lip in anger well hermione always struck me as the type that couldntkeep up the innocence charade for long i always knew she was a little wh hermione put the pillow over head she didntwant to hear what they were saying about her they were telling vicious loathsome lies spreading rumors that would ruin her hermione felt tears burn behind her eyelids but she refused to let them free until she couldnthold them back anymore and began to sob she had no friends she had no house she was nothing had nothing no one except for crookshanks who she hadntseen since yesterday hermione buried her head into her pillow and tried to drown out their voices by remembering a song you say you wander your own land but when i think about i dontknow how you can you re aching you re breaking and i can see the pain in your eyes says everybody changing and i dontknow why so little time try to understand that i trying to make a move just to stay in the game trying to stay awake and remember my name because everybody changing and i dontfeel the same you re gone from here soon you will disappear fading into beautiful light because everybody changing and i dontfeel right hermione sighed and let go allowing herself to sleep through the anguish she felt and held onto the possibility that tomorrow would be a better day author note that is not my song and anyone who knows awesome music will know that big thanks to keane for being the magic musical gurus they are in case you haventcaught on keane the band that wrote
